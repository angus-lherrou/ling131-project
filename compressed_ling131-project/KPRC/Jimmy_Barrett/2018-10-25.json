don't know you had a funny line to anyway Chuck Grassley on Thursday referred Julie sweating and her\nLawyer Michael evidence to the department of justice for a possible criminal investigation over allegations that they made false statements to Congress about\nBrett Kavanaugh lady ... that's the thing is I don't get to make up the facts I Wish I could I Wish I could make up the facts for you if I could make up the facts this would be a show like everybody in the country has got to get a\nFree ticket today in the mail for tacos no that's not what's happening lady this is this is awfully specific great like do you think she may even have a horse\nIn this race I'm not a Republican I don't care Brett Kavanaugh's the moderates if Brett Kavanaugh didn't get on to the Supreme Court we would have got Amy Cohen beret and she would have been better no really there's a part of me in the back of my head it bothers the crap outta me it bothers the hell out of me the Democrats\nLeveled these false allegations ... judge Brett Kavanaugh and that's the only reason why I defended him I'm not a Brett Kavanaugh Republican I don't care about defending Brett Kavanaugh lady oh bless your sweetheart oh Mickey I could count there are ... there are more letters in your first name\n[laughter] than there are two points for your brain because you're not a smart person so Grassley is saying here's what Chuck Grassley said Chuck Grassley and I don't I've never been crazy about Chuck Grassley but he this was his doing if you don't like it lady\nMove to the state where he's from originally from South Dakota is that we're Chuck Grassley from each from one of the Dakotas\nHe's really into corn and stuff like that um and and [laughter] he has done a fantastic job of trying to get the truth out about what's going on right now uh excuse me Iowa that's what I meant to say not the Dakotas I'm Sorry about that I hate when they give the wrong information on the air but I was wrong about he's from Iowa that's what I meant to say not the Dakota so\nAnyway Chuck Grassley is saying when a well meaning citizen comes for information relevant to the committee's work I take it seriously\nIt takes courage to come forward it does I agree with him he continues especially with allegations of sexual misconduct are personal trauma here here Chuck Grassley who's right about fish I'm grateful for those you find that courage Grassley\nContinued but in the heat of partisan moments some do try to knowingly mislead the committee\nYeah like I don't like CPR for example creepy born lawyer yeah I think he did [laughter] I think he did\nChuck Grassley continues that's unfair to my colleagues the nominees and others providing information or seeking the truth yeah Avon Eddie as a potential twenty twenty democratic for gradual candidate\nCNN reading the story it's not a right wing news outlet it's CNN the communist news network oh Mickey Mickey as going nuts right now in the comet she's so angry defending herself what whatever yeah we'll get Chris part my Facebook Live video and look at the comments section it's pure comedy like she thinks I'm making up stories I'm here\nNot how this works lady I go I get we don't we don't make up facts we find out what the major news outlets are reporting on we tell you that information and then I respond to it and I try to piece together faction information so I could for my conclusion oh Mickey you're the best part of the show today I really thought\nWhen the phones went down in their fix by the way the Folger backup if anybody wants to get it on this seven when three two on two five nine five zero seven when three two one two five nine five zero of anybody wants to get it on the phones are back up now\nGradually shifted to find folks and the engineering department ... it was a quick there was a quick problem we got ... now my producer crisis in the comments section this is\nMy Facebook Live videos have turned into nothing short of a of a three ring circus today because I'm starting to attract the kind of people I wanted to get I wanted to get people into the show who are libertarians mission accomplished\nAll the libertarians in Houston and been listening to pursue to happiness radio since it went on the air it's one of the only shows in in Houston it's focused on what libertarians are doing man I wanted to get like the ... the Republicans in America guys we have a lot in common with those guys I Want to I Want to bridge the gap between them I Want to shorten the divide I I think we could work with those guys and a lot of ways we have\nYou guys are seen what Rand Paul is done with Donald Trump over the last couple of years it's been fantastic and I want to do the same thing with this radio show but last but not least certainly not least I Want to get the really really cringe worthy laughable progressive trolls to check on my show\nAnd they're doing it [laughter] I [laughter] I had a whole\nNother segment prepared right now but this is infinitely more interesting than that [laughter]\nOh it's a it's it's too much fun I mean here's what I wanted to talk about what I wanted to talk about was the migrant Caribbean hey Mickey if you thought I was lying about that news story that I just read from CNN dot com to you where do you hear this Fox News sends a reporter out to the Caribbean now how big is the Caribbean now\nWe know it's at least seven thousand people oh Mickey you're gonna hate that we know it's at least seven thousand people\nAnd we know that uh the the numbers could maybe be as high as ten people are reporting some big numbers\nI always try to go with the lower side of it is to just say it's at least seven thousand so for the purpose of reporting honestly so people like Mickey out there uh you know don't stay up all night are biting their nails over what I've said on the radio today we just like to address things will be truthful and honest with you 'cause it's me I'm a nice guy I'm I like honesty\nAnd I liked the truth well Fox News sends a guy out today\nI think it was actually yesterday they send a reporter out Chris sent me this new story my producer this happened yesterday right they send a guy out to walk amongst people in the Caribbean and\nAsk them look here's what people are really worried about in America we don't dislike foreigners we want the world's entrepreneur is and scientists and doctors and dentists and all the hardworking law abiding citizens to come to America come here\nAbsolutely there's room in America for every one that's not what this is about I'm not like Tom Cotton in Arkansas I don't think that we should seal off the border I don't think we should do that at all um there are places along the border where there's legitimately or human rights crisis happening\nAnd we need to do something about that because people are getting raped and kidnapped tortured and worst out there were the cartels and the coyotes control things murder local journalists and pay off police officers to look the other way that's\nA problem right but but similarly this caravan what we're worried about here is the same thing is there's somebody in this caravan\nThat's that's not coming to get asylum it's not a refugee there's there's somebody in the Caribbean who maybe is friendly I must Thirteen or ... the Gulf Cartel and they're trying to escape persecution in Central America because they broke the law down there and they figure out we'll go to one of the sanctuary cities in America and will hide out to the Fox news reporter is walking around\nAnd he finds a guy and he asked him what what's the truth either criminals here in the crowd and the guy goes a very honest answer\nThose everywhere [noise]\nIs claiming will say here I mean it is a\nGuy in the Caribbean is even admitting it they're criminals everywhere they're criminals here there are and that's what he's saying right now for those that are\nCurious about that what did you go on to say he goes on to make the point that the five second soundbite what happens after that is always a great question what happens after that as he goes on to make the point but there's also women and children and families there\nBut hidden amongst them are criminals who need to be about it I'm kind of left your junior thanks so much for watching everybody don't pick on Mickey anymore

so we uh we post videos up there in addition to doing the live broadcast\nProbably remember what was that I put up there today\nYeah I'll think of it and when I think of it I'll let you know 'cause it's worth checking out oh I Know with it I Know ... personal Facebook page which by the way You're welcome differently and my personal Facebook page as well\nUm I put I put a a link to a trailer from I'm\nA new Netflix show a horror show that supposedly so scary people are passing out in vomiting while they watch it\nFirst of all\nI don't know that I really want to watch that that's scary my case I pull my pants were good as eggs but um I I I guess I guess it's a good endorsement for people like\nTo get scared of so he's going to check out the trailer you could check it out on my Facebook page\nOr the trailer this it's creepy but then again I guess it's a trailer is not bad to scare the bejesus out of the of course you have to subscribe to Netflix in order to get it but supposedly Stephen King who's been known to scare few people as they pet cemetery the shining a all that kind of stuff\nHe says is the scariest TV shows that we're seeing\nSo maybe there's something to it I'm not sure all\nRight we're talking we're talking about the the pipe bomb situation\nA mind let loose got that I'm hearing ... or anything more about the new ones um since uh the reception from Joe Biden\nWho got one and uh the actor Robert Deniro as Dr Becca studios he got ... those were the spawning\nSo I haven't read more about a new one since so are there more coming though no\nBut I thought this was kind of interesting and that is the behind the scenes workings of trying to figure out who's responsible for it there's a lot of forensics at work I don't know if you're really interested in ... my wife Elizabeth loves loves loves loves forensic\nShows who did a crime shows and trying to figure out who did a base of or insects\nSo I thought this was kind of interesting this report from a Fox reporter Catherine heritage it's from yesterday but just the same thing they're working on as far as today and however long it takes to figure out where these things came from here ... some kind of interesting inside information if you will\nAbout how the FBI is working on and what kind of a theory they're working on when it comes to these packages\nAnd working with the ... is that the device is sent by a single individual or a single group and this is based on forensics as well as the fact that we're talking about multiple devices over Seventy two hour period\nWhat's key I'm told is that there are a number of very striking similarities with the packaging of the devices so that same say excessive ... stage or that sort of excess said yellow packaging also that very crude attract that we saw on the package that was sent to CNN they're\nAlso you can see that the ... the address is there's so much shifted to one side is not center properly Olympians or tell tale signs\nOf suspicious device and should not be opened a I was also told and I think this is all saying is\nThat the George Soros package it's also very similar in its packaging and prescription ... are also considered I in the same group as five they say they're working with theory and individual or a single ...\nOkay that makes sense what it is with us time to try to figure out who's responsible for this I still find it very interesting don't use that um you know none of these devices went off none of the nine devices went off\nAnd what I have to wonder and of course well we're not hearing about is how these things we're wired where they wired to detonate where they just the parts of a pipe bomb and they weren't really hooked up in order to detonate um is the powder\nThat they're finding is a part of this is it an explosive powder or is it flour or something else no words this is meant to look like a pipe bomb and it is or it's meant to look like a pipe bomb and it really gives it a pipe bomb they can or anybody\nIs strictly to send a message or was there an actual intend to do physical harm or no don't get me wrong either way it's still an act of terrorism I don't care who did it or what their motivation was still an act of terrorism\nBut it would be very very curious to find out what did not exactly what those things we're in we're not capable of doing\nAll right as far as the old toning down the bad talk thing let's get a couple of more Republicans in here to see what they're thinking about this story here's representative Garamendi\nThe reality is it's just a short narrowly dangerous and potentially harmful a situation I fortunately nobody has spent hurt and hopefully that will be the case throughout this final get quickly resolved the rest of the story is\nRhetoric in this campaign has been extraordinarily hot\nAnd in some cases very very directed whomever has spent saying very hot very directive very invective words\nOr wherever they may be on whichever side it really has to tone down because words do have made in and there are folks out there that will follow a anybody's word or summer ice words so tone it down\nI get to the underlying issues and carry it forward\nIf it is going to tone down it's not going to tone down until after the midterm elections that seems pretty clear to me that that this rhetoric is going to keep broad ongoing especially from the left they have an election they're trying to win and\n\nI again I'm not making an accusation I'm Serious I'm sharing a possible theory that you could just as easily be somebody who supports left to somebody supports the right\nBecause we seem to be going to extraordinary lengths these days to try to win elections even if that means scaring people and and and and make no mistake about scaring people is a very effective way to change hearts and minds\nYou know we we've been willing to put up with a lot of things going some of the aspects of the Patriot act which turned out to not be so great because we're afraid of terrorism\nYou know what what would be we what would we moderate what with moderate individuals be willing to do as far as rethinking their their election vote in the mid term if they thought that the price of the United states was inciting this type of violence of people\nWhich of course is what the left saying All right more reasonable minds are out there including somebody by the way who has been a victim of a terrorist act that was done by a liberal at a baseball game in Washington DC and that's Louisiana\nSenator Steve ... who was shot as you know severely wounded survived it here's what he says about the bombing\n\nOf soccer it's it's anger or you know this isn't the way that we should expect America to be turning I mean you're seeing more and more of this and clearly you're seeing it on both sides are we all need to be calling it out obviously we need to find out what happened in the FBI is in the process of doing it I feel very confident that our law enforcement\nYou got to know when you go there and what you are running into\nIt sure enough I guess she found out the hard way All right here's here's something I've been mulling around a little bit here it's that it certainly is not that big of a deal but it does make some sense to me you know Halloween and the day of the week it falls on\nYou don't normally not a big fan of just changing a holiday to make it more convenient you know like like changing or like if we were to ever do something for example changed Christmas\nSo the Christmas always falls on a friday or a Monday so you end up with a long weekend I wouldn't be in favor of that even though technically December the twenty fifth the ... if we were to do a real history search here we can't we certainly cannot prove that data is having any real significance for the standpoint of actually being the birth of Jesus Christ\nSo but I beat you you you would ... you wouldn't support changing that right just you can have a long weekend no of course not now Labor Day\nAlways falls on a Monday first Monday in September were in favor of that we get along weekend for it and there's no great significance to Labor Day\nI guess if you're a member of the union or something maybe you put a little bit of significance in it but from a practical standpoint probably most people don't even realize that that's the hard labor day started was an attempt\nTo try to honor unions and union workers in and people who labor I mean it's not just exclusive unions but that's kind of who got behind the push to begin with you know Thanksgiving is always on the Thursday\nLast Thursday of November's when we have Thanksgiving that's traditional that one doesn't move around but\nThen again it doesn't need to because we take a really long weekend takes Thursday often friday often yeah maybe I'll come back on Monday maybe I won't\nHalloween is one of those holidays that for whatever reason nobody has really ever messed with and I'm not quite sure what it is there's no really great significance I don't\nBelieve to October the thirty first other than a date that was picked on the Keller dirt to celebrate the harvest season I'm sure there there probably is some other things like that I'm not even aware of having to do with lord knows what that makes that particular date somewhat significant but from a practical\nStandpoint nobody takes a look at October the thirty first in ... in it certainly we don't put any religious significance on Halloween it's just a day to dress up and have the kids go trick or treating\nDoes it make sense to rethink celebrating Halloween other job or thirty first because they for whatever reason\nThere's rarely seems to fall during the weekend it has a tendency to fall on either a a\nA weeknight\nLike what is it this year after thirty first what is it like a Wednesday night though I only paid attention yet to do exactly when that's going to fall this year but it's ... it's it's in the middle of the week\nWhere um you know kids have to get up and go to school the next day or parents have to try to feed the kids and in the family and get together and get them dressed in get them outside and make the rounds and pick up a little bit of candy and get back on again the bed\nWas this a lot of work in a lot of hassle and not really a whole lotta time to have fun with it if that's what you really want to do\nSo does it make sense to change\nHalloween so it always falls on a friday or Saturday\n\nWere you know I mean pick one friday or Saturday last friday was the last Saturday I looked over\nThat can be your Halloween and that would be the date that the kids go trick or treating and that would be the day we celebrate the holiday and we wouldn't have to worry about getting them up for school the next day and we could go back to the good old days when kids really put an effort in the collecting candy\nMe that's the problem you can't even get kids to work for candy anymore nobody's guy stamina for this\nNo I don't know about you but when I was a kid we didn't take a bag we didn't take one of those little plastic pumpkins\nHeck no we use pillow cases I mean it wasn't a king size\nBelow case that that you wouldn't be able to carry that as a kid I mean once you got to halfway Boulder you'd be you'd be lucky if you could drag it behind\nYou what you know a regular double bedside spill case it we'd fill that up a candy we would not stop\nIt you'll get right to the point where you you could barely you could barely carry it anymore because after all you have to go through and you have to weed out the stuff you don't like and you have to bargain with your siblings or your friends you know give you a you know\nOne butter finger for two of those two dorm enjoys or whatever whatever your favorite thing is er during the ... Texas I'll give you two bought her fingers for one reason he says\n\nIt's no fun when you just have a little tiny bit of candy\nOf course you know done a seven done a very good job of bracing hold either you know if I were a dentist I Would be the world's biggest supporter of Halloween I Would want kids out there grabbing candy I'd want them to get all that sugar up there in the tea\n'cause it's going to be more business for me I'll be busy with Phyllis I'll make a fortune and feelings in fact I Would I be feeding candy to the kids who come in I'd open up my dentist office for extra hours\nYou said they tried to talk about it eating candy what's wrong with these Dennis by the way do you notice it is it just me or do we like have a dentist on every other corner here in Houston\nIt every single strip mall out here where I live every single strip mall as a dentist office and I do we like graduate more dental students in Houston and\nAnd in College Station and in the surrounding areas do we do we have more we have more debt is settled here than any other place and not just your regular DDS is I mean we're talking about people whose who specializes in orthodontics in other areas as well as just amazing how many people we have in the world of dentistry\nI wouldn't have a problem you want to switch Halloween to a friday or Saturday and\nMake that permanent I'd go to that there's no significance to me about the thirty first\nMake it easier for people who enjoy the holiday what the heck if we're going to do it let's do it up right coming up on three fifty eight you're on a a nine fifty K.
