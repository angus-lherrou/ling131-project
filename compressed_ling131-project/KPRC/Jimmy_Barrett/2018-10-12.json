{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "All the ... keepers salty about bad you didn't like it ... they cancelled the show and he's having a bad Halloween what are you going as\nWell um I'm not quite sure yet well my wife and I didn't want to offend anybody so I decided to dress as a Native American and Morgan is going to go as I Know some other marginalized group that you're not supposed to address a sexy\nOh but ... the kitty or or well that's no you can't do that anymore I found it gets offended by now how 'bout how 'bout I go is sexy Robert Deniro Robert Deniro I only say that is a terrible thing you'd have to cut your legs off about seven or eight inches\nThat's true that's fair he um I I short little so that is true I only bring up Robert Deniro to say this first of all ... has campaigned and raised a ridiculous amount of money at thirty eight million three million dollars now it is highly likely that Iraq has raised more than every democratic nominee for the U.S Senate from Texas\nSince at least Nineteen Seventy eight combined mhm they're saying that they it goes back to Nineteen eighty two campaign finance records from before Nineteen eighty two are generally not available on FCC's website I in that agency only goes back to Nineteen Seventy five so it is possible that ... Rourke\nIs the biggest Senate campaign candidate of all time for Democrats I mean it's possible it's possible yeah we don't really know it it certainly looks that way this is record breaking amounts of stuff so where do you think all that money came from um I don't think it came from Texas more than\nHalf of it came from outside of Texas right according to according to the ... open secret star or something like sixty eight percent I mean more than half which should bother people and I I Would be curious to see where that money comes from I Would be willing to bet top three like this California and New York Illinois you\nKnow what I Would I Would say maybe not Illinois but why don't ... people in Chicago D.C for sure yeah definitely ... Chicago probably number four then yeah because people in Chicago I spend a lot of money on politics and other states\nAnd they said do it because they're in in Illinois and the Democrats whenever we had a choice yeah exactly ... they'll have a Republican governor just to like keep things interesting they have one right now and he is very moderate he's not far to the right at all and they can't get anything done in that state well good yeah you\nKnow the the less they get done the less taxation the average citizen has to\nOffer you just reminded me of something I I heard an interesting thing recently Janine with taxation is that taxes should have stopped\nAbsolutely true anyway I get very angry about taxation taxation is slapped\nTariffs our taxes so those are the captain socialism is an entire system designed around taxation which has stopped which means socialism is what ... socialism is theft and it's death and I would say extortion but yeah any of those answers correct ding ding ding winner winner chicken dinner which is now in a sense of term to use that one\nBecause it because it's um non inclusive to people who were beaten oh\nYeah I Know I Know they're very mad about there's there's a lot that we you know part of what's interesting about the social justice warriors and the PC culture is we actually have Australia to blame for a lot of this oh yeah in Australia this is very normal here in America we're still not sure I don't know what about in\nAustralia and there's a movement now to ask the babies can send you\n\nA good example of what I'm Talking about I almost forgot about that yeah there's a thing in in Australia they they actually had a PSA they were circulating on line and some of us here in America got wind of this and we thought oh\nThis must be ... news not satire\nNo it's really not satire if I change your nappy in the meantime Robert De Niro who probably is one of the people it's thrown a lot of money or ... or work I'd be willing to bet\nShe thinks that Beto O'Rourke should run for president in twenty twenty which I think is what a lot of us just assumed that he was trying to do yeah here in Texas because he certainly can't be running for Senate in ...\nThat is that these are his ridiculous policy positions\nRight I mean and what's really funny is that with all the money that is being thrown at bay though and and his way uh his\nPoll numbers um just are not reflecting the effort\nTo know right now it looks like Ted Cruz for for for for what is considered to be I think it was a Texas Tribune these these posters always lean to the left and may have Ted Cruz ahead by nine right now so what do you think the real number is I Would bet it's twice that\nI'd say it's probably fourteen fifth\nYeah I Would I Would pick a team but yeah you're right I think you're being fair yeah it's definitely more than nine and here's part of the reason why that is true first of all these posters it always leads to the left but what part of the reason why it always leads to the left is they just don't talk to people like us have you ever been contacted by a pollster\nUh the last time I was contacted by a pollster I think it was twenty ten I'm impressed that they contacted you at all 'cause it's never happened to me it didn't happen to me when I Lived in Illinois and it's never happened to me in Texas right and it and the polls are always wrong to St pollsters who think Ted Cruz's ahead by nine told us Hillary would win by a wide margin\nThat's right yeah they told her told us that she had a Ninety three percent chance of winning\nYeah absolutely just silly silly what a bunch of silly now hey speaking of silly and living in a Hollywood um have you heard about what Arnold Schwarzenegger did\nDid he finally apologize for being himself\nKind of fortunate or used to be young people don't believe me when I tell the most but Arnold Schwarzenegger used to be cool no it's true it's true yeah Arnold Schwarzenegger used to be cool I thought people were supposed to move further to the right when they got older but why but I Will do the opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger used to joke\nThat only girly man a girly man girly man opposed energetic capitalism in traditional American values but now\nThe former California Governor is apologizing for popular rising to pledge\nYes yes he is and I think he also said that he he kinda got out of line with some of the women but you know he was married to a Kennedy for\nProducer Chris you're on your early twenties are you old enough to know about girly man the phrase that was popular in the nineties or you're too young for that\nHe doesn't remember Saturday Night live sketch between two guys ... from\n... from two to ... you know I did it wrong to you and\nThen they would do exercises I screwed it up you've got to read 'em and then and then I'm very caught wind of this catchphrase girly man and then it became a big thing in the nineties it was like why\nWhat was another thing that they use and we're not going to remember all stupid catch phrases from that I knew anyone Arnold Schwarzenegger not only does he feel bad about that but it in a recent interview he admitted that he stepped over the line several times were sweat [laughter] to the exact\nQuote I Wonder if he's definitely over the line is when he's having an affair with the housekeeper oh yeah that's right and I love child to a lot of child and he's got a lot of child with her and uh what what do you think her name was I always imagined\nThat the woman that he made ... too was kind of like Consuelo though the ... the house cleaning lady family like Arnold comes home he goes Oh yes ... love and she goes\nOh no it's not time not have to clean the house\nI'm Kevin I'm sure junior I Want to

Bush doesn't like black people care Hurricane Katrina\nAnd email ... though the now the sudden ... because he put on a ... hat\nAnd he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro that the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has already been hospitalized you know I'm not the trivialize mental health issues but I mean obviously cognac has taken a turn in a very strange way\nWho else would dare go somebody a token negro wow\nWow\nThat is really quite amazing joining us now from the media research centers then gain or a then keeps track of how the media treats the president and when it comes to the mainstream media Ninety two percent negative what do you make a go of tourists admire on CNN what she said about Kanye West\nWell it's vomit is the easy way to tell bias is\nYou simply ... tracked out the particulars of the event okay I mentioned that this wasn't said by her about Kanye West I imagine it was said by somebody on the right if I Kanye West and imagine that immediate\nReaction if somebody on the right call county west a token they grow a that would be it wouldn't you wouldn't be able to knock down buildings with with the power of the force of of the anger that\nYou would have and that it's astonishing and it's and it's just constant drumbeat\nOh he's crazy oh he's he's stupid oh he's a token Kanye West is as Donald Trump one of the most successful will know people\nOn the go low\n... self bills I mean he he made his career I'm not a big coyote with music fan but I Can't remember the last time a person who's theoretically\nSupposed to be a liberal celebrity to go and sit there and sit down and turned to the press and say guns are not the problem illegal guns are the problem we have a Second Amendment right to God\nI Do I not expecting that this is all going to turn out perfectly sooner or later maybe Kanye West decides to go back that he's been beat up too much by the herd of the media and\nThe left but right now that message the message that Republicans or conservatives don't hate all black people that the president of the United states clearly the mouse that roared and I mean I really admire that President for his ability to talk\nA ... but he's known for and for him to sit there and let Kanye West talk and for when it's done for them to hug for him to ... to honor Kanye in that way do you think that that doesn't that that message doesn't seep through our culture\nOf course it does I\nLive in Maryland Maryland right now is in the midst of a gubernatorial race Maryland is a blue state one of the blue is in the country\nIt's got a Republican governor\nWho is running for reelection in the entire history of the state of Maryland one Republican governor has been reelected want so once in a while we catch lightning in a bottle Republican wins well the current gubernatorial candidate against him\nIs Ben Jealous former head of the N. double ACP\nHe's got almost no support in the state\nOr the current governor has twenty percent lead according to polls\nTwenty percent now nobody is doing that down stream polling from Kanye West but Maryland's about one fourth African American and so if Kanye West is having some sort of impact maybe it's having an impact down racist I don't know\nBut certainly no matter how you look at this the the left is doing the math and the\nMath terrifies the meteor doing the math and the math terrifies 'cause heres why the entire premise\nOf the left winning elections is based now a demographic say oh the rising tide of minorities eventually America is going to be a minority majority country where where whites are no longer in the majority and they're the premises all the minority groups will vote for Democrats\nWell Donald Trump got more than a typical Republican gotten two and twenty sixteen he got eight percent which is really pathetic but he did that generally ... does awful with with a African American voters awful so he got ... percent\nRight now I've seen polling that has his popularity in the black community somewhere in the thirties\nNow about thirty five yeah if if it's even half that so let's say Seventeen Eighteen\nPercent so it ten percent jump from eight percent\nYeah in fact amazing yeah you look at look at the analysis and my colleague rich did what you'll discover is the only category where it's noticeably less than\nNinety is\nEighty two percent and that's the camp out in the covered Kavanaugh and even neck gets an Astros just like Roger Maris who got for for\nHitting home runs basically baseball but the reason why is because there were only looking how the press covered how Trump was handling it\nAnd so that doesn't count all the massive attacks on cap and on self it just specifically that Trump ...\nDecided to do this or took this action and since it ended up working at Trump's nominee approved and yet ... found to be a little bit bump but the ridiculous level of negativity for\nKavanaugh for Trump for anyone in Trump's universe\nKanye West et cetera ... is so astonishing yeah you can't look at all this and say\nThis is the liberal media Charles oh well this isn't normal\nThey love to say that France still differ from CNN loves to use that term well this isn't don't know it's not yes we have a president who shoots from the ... people used to like to say and so sometimes he misspeak when he talked I ever met\nA politician who just sometimes misspeak what has happened\nInstead is oppressive so I think get truck that any little ... that they can find oh well he said you're shoveling point five seven point for six and and you see people freaking out about it that price\nTry very hard if you think back they tried very hard to use Donald Trump he flipped the script they they want to have him\nTo find that you pay so that no matter who won that you can nominate nation they would be damaged from the fight Donald Trump would have walked away from the party that they were all sure it was going to happen\nIt wouldn't keep running and so they thought by throwing a lot of media coverage at Trump's early they would hurt that she okay\nDonald Trump was smarter than that he knew how they play their game and he ran hard and next thing they knew he was winning and they created the ultimate Frankenstein monster and they couldn't stand it they freak out or they spent every moment of every day since\nTrying to destroy and threatened history anybody around him and they they constantly say Trump is also\nInsane Trump is stupid Trump is this Trump is that well if Trump is so stupid Trump is so insane how come he has singlehandedly I guess it really is pretty singlehandedly defeated the entire media\nWorld not just United States because you remember press outlets from around the world are trying to take down Trump to how is he he's somehow oh not that good and yet she keeps feeding\nMe didn't let let me let me let me read this ... let me ask you this because I think that the you know\nLot of people feel well I don't know about a lot of people feel but I certainly feel like like ... ... people kind of catching on to all this I'm certainly\nI'm the president would not have authority by ... percent pauses Bernie with African Americans if people were not catching on to what it is the mainstream media is doing do you also believe that the case\nWell I think somewhat it's true I look how quickly things have turned a first polling in the Texas Senate\nPeople understand are being used by the national media doesn't matter which can do you support in Texas okay what matters is the press very obviously support work\nOkay I could not to the point where they live media columnist for political wrote today about how the press keeps writing these loving profiles adopted or work issue on the list he listed a loving\nDifferent outlets to first hand we're time in New York times and and the political where she works number eleven was the Washington Post and he was you know they think they did an article on a call this or that that you said that's the kind of covers it normally reserved for the Washington Redskins\nThat works is\nTwo thousand miles away in Texas you know no Texas voter reading the Washington Post but the major media aren't trying to get the Texas voter what they're trying to do is get the Washington fundraiser they're trying to get Hollywood money and so what do we see we go work at thirty million dollars in\nThe lab anymore you know at that and that all comes from this nationwide press momentum\nAnd nobody had on the show for it here in Texas so far Dan he's gone down by ... percent yeah he was gone for five percent to ... percent as far as how far he's\nThrilled at least according to that particular piece of polling data which I Know for the whole of snuck into anyway because we don't need to use\nWhat it really shows though is it American media I mean let's stop pretending the American media were\nEver neutral but they're so much worse now they are I I Know people would say the arm of the Democratic party\nThat's not true but never credit parties arm of the American news media that's true\nYeah here's here's one thing though that is scaring me just a little bit and uh you know I've been talking about this a lot in the morning on to your age which is there's this ... this\nThis effort on behalf of of uh of liberals to to try to whip people into such a frenzy in into justify violence now and I've seen the politicians do you know now I'm seeing anchors there's an anchor on MSNBC who was um\nDoing a little too and they wanted to know who is that you know she was talking to 'em Jeb Bush and she wanted to know and she really person I Want to know why didn't you Punjab Donald Trump\nOr that we're in theoretically Republican or conservative on their network that shows these outlets are your why didn't you know she also\nI think there's something something similar to that once before she she she just\nDances around very dangerous stuff a friend of mine who worked for Breitbart did an interview with Rand Paul twice this week and she admitted that she is afraid of what people are going to do and she\nActually you're living with a gun yeah I mean it's yeah it's really has its\nBecause her husband was beaten up by a neighbor or a Republican congressman or you're someone tried to commit mass murder with people forget all was there that day too I this is a
