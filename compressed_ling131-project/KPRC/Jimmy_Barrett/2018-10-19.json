sense of\nCommon sense for Houston this is from Houston\nThis is the sheer these beret show ... dot com [noise]\nI mean very\nIdle at least one person who's listening right now and that's my wife to make sure that I'm actually on the air that I'm actually doing your show today and that we actually still have power to our house hello hello Houston three oh six you're on KP RCA I'm nine fifty hum I suppose you'd probably wondering what the hell happened to me right\nWell I Can't say I believe or for that you got time for a story I guess it's it's a little bit of a story so ah we've had some problems since Tuesday involving lost power\nAnd I know what you're you're thinking Tuesday what happened on Tuesday Wednesday storms on Tuesday and you're right there weren't any storms on Tuesday had nothing to do with the storm\nWe lost power and we had no idea why we lost power and of course you know if you call any of the utilities are in this case is you know set up on ever used in charge of maintained the lines here around town and um if you call them you'll you'll get a\nCall center where Web wherever it is a I don't think it's in it's in Houston I don't know where I don't know if it's in Texas to be honest with you a better than any rate you know you'll get somebody there who are very nice and they they tried to be very helpful but they have a limited amount of information to share with you especially\nYou know when you call in to report that your powers out and of course the first thing question you have when the power's out and\nWhether slide is what happened and it's rare that they are in a position to tell you right away exactly what happened\nSo we were far from alone our entire neighborhood was out of power or over four thousand people here in the area where we live we're out of power\nAnd we had no idea why and for a while we didn't have any idea how long it was going to take it to come back but I Would say probably within\nFour or five hours and remember exactly but within four or five hours to power came back and everybody that good great you know wasn't didn't go back in time for for me on Tuesday but at least at least a gay back\nSo that's when the fund really started because for whatever reason twenty eight homes where we live in our in our subdivision or twenty eight homes\nRepeatedly would lose power power would come back it'd be around for a couple of hours and then you hear a big bang and all that would go\nAnd it'd be three or four or five hours later powered come back after a couple of hours bam up it will go\nClearly something was going wrong\nAnd uh the folks to center point Roger ... billion times trying to figure out exactly what was going on\nSo he came to be that are they big bang we were all hearing was a a a line fuse blowing\nSo we knew or and they knew that something was causing these um the open up the overheating issue\nAnd we weren't quite sure what it was in the they started you know there's there's a lot of trans boundaries around here there's there's some yards there's there's some that are out on the streets and there they they saw evidence that something wasn't quite right on the street so they fixed that put everybody back up you know a couple three four hours later boom off we go again\nAnd this happened like five times\nJust having like five times over the course of three days and that is frustrating beyond all believe\nEspecially when you know I mean I Know they're trying to fix it but there's a part of me and says come on they have to have somebody over this complete electrical genius who can figure this out and figure out what the problem is it I think what it was ultimately as it was a whole laundry list of issues\nThat they had to go through the fix one thing something else would fail they fixed that something else would fail and I think finally at the end of the day there is a um you know trends sponsored that's in the back of those big green boxes that Holmes get wired into I'm One of those was bad in my neighbor's backyard\nAnd they just ended up replacing the whole thing\nBut I Want to give us that are born energy little shut out a little credit now I'll be honest with you I thought when I was going to be doing the program today I was probably going to be ripping then Raylan all over him but the reality is they did everything they could to try to figure out exactly what was going on\nAnd at the end of the day it was like the calorie arrive when they finally brought in this new ... bucks there was like four trucks and a crane and if you're faced with brand new so I took a picture that yesterday and they got hooked up and about I'm I'm gonna say around for thirty\nUh yesterday afternoon we finally got there or back no I didn't trust trying to come on just to do an hour of the show I'm not knowing whether or not the power was going to go out but we we've gone since then so it's been the better part twenty four hours without any power issue so\nI got up and knock on my microphone because I don't have any ... didn't hear a ... that it doesn't happen again\nBut I did find I did find something in the experience um again I I felt that once I was able to contact somebody in a local basis the local folks here in Houston are fantastic\nThey're very helpful very polite they're all about getting as much information as they can\nIt's when you get a little bit higher or I guess it depends on how you look at it higher up the corporate Jane are lower the corporate Jane where things probably could improve and maybe maybe I'm living in a a a ... in the world where this type of customer service doesn't exist anymore but I Do have some suggestions\nFor a couple of things and it's not just center point energy is what any utility any big company could do a that provides you a service that when you're without the service you're kind of being driven\nCrazy and you just want to get some basic information or in in some small changes they could make that would probably keep people from getting irate well we keep people from getting his irate as they get which people have a tendency to do and um\nI'll I'll go ahead and take a break when we come back to the break those share some of those suggestions also I guess something I Want you to be thinking of you because I Want to do a little calling segment on this one the new Halloween movies out this weekend the one with the the queen of scream she's back Jamie Lee Curtis\nAnd I'm Wondering because there are probably two movies in my world that I Can't watch because they do scare me to death and you can be scared to death I\nHave that other reliable word of a cardiologist you can be scared to death so be thinking about that one I'll\nLet you a call in here you do next segment [noise] uh and uh tell me what movies Mike literally scare you to death [noise]\nAll right good she wants to someone three five nine fifty seven one three five nine fifty as how you get a hold me here

I mentioned before certainly on a Katie rates in the morning but I don't know if I've missed it at all here in the afternoon I have a very unhealthy fear of clowns\nWell\nI probably shouldn't say that I'm probably I'm probably not as afraid of clowns as is I let on I mean it's not like if if a clown if Iran into account on the street and that wasn't the only in I wasn't the only person on the street I wouldn't turn around and run away from the clown but\nIf I was on the street\nAlone and a clown came walking by\nIf it's anybody other than Ronald McDonald I'm probably getting ready to run to the opposite direction\nAnd I think that goes back to um the character penny wise are you familiar with penny wise\nAgain another it's another me Stephen King I'm afraid of saving kings the one that seems right all the stuff I'm afraid of but it's\nUm and it it was such a a poorly done made for TV style movie the first one and he was on and and I watched it and I could as an adult I could watch it wears a youngster I couldn't watch it\nAnd I guess it's because you know special effects were just sort of dated and they didn't have the same if it didn't it didn't wear very well based on\nYou know based on\nThe ... you know the difference in technology between today and back then\nSo it it was all it doesn't scare me as much but you know they had the new version of it come out and all I had to do is look at the picture of the new anyone who looked infinitely more evil and scary than\nThe original that I just you know I just well no no no no no no no no I Want nothing to do with that yeah I'm looking at 'em rotten tomatoes has a list of the hundred and fifty best horror films of all time\nAnd when you think about it I mean they're really have been a tremendous amount of horror films that have been made and I guess the reason why they've been somebody made is well number one they're very cheap to make your only speaking\nThey're very very um cheap to make the relatively easy to make and if they're the least bit decent they have a tendency to make a lot of money\nYou know I'm\nThe Freddie Krueger character how many how many of those movies where the nightmare on elm street how many nightmare on elm street versions where they're\nAnd they're all pretty much the same movie\nBuddy you obviously don't produce that many versions of a nightmare on elm street unless it's just really really easy to do how 'bout Texas Chainsaw massacre where we'll just have read on your list as as a really scary movie again nothing was done really super super cheap\nThat movie Kramer fight washed Texas Chainsaw massacre something about a guy you know cutting up people with the chain so that just didn't really appeal to me that much I guess I I like my movies more slightly more ...\nThan than than most I like I like things that scare me that don't even really exist you did you understand what I'm saying kind of a thing where were you he eats it's your fear of what\nMight be coming or not knowing what's coming they get your attention the ones that really predictable to me or not that scary I'm trying to think what else would make my list of of horror movies you know at the time and I don't know if I don't think it\nReally it didn't really scare me but for some reason I really liked the movie poultry guys remember photographs and again that movie did very very well and they did a a a a second one in that one was decent by the time they get to the third one it is it you know completely lost ... lost her\nFor some reason for some reason I just don't understand what the reason is um some of these movies where very very well in some of them do not ah we're very well at all so we have a caller might as well what I'm hearing we have a caller going by an auto who it is\nBut if they're there I'll talk to him to say if you don't hear anybody\nMike Mike in Cyprus how are you I'm like hey I'm doing well\nWouldn't really down for that movie to begin with but after that it's like ... how how old's your daughter when she watched it she was like sixteen I'm feeling like\nHurt or hurt her mom are like totally in the poorer flakes and I've never really ... you know I've never really care too much about him but I'd watch 'em didn't think much about him\nBut not like oh you do for me out here do you think that she or the cat or\nOr both of them were having some sort of a quote unquote experience\nI well that's the way she put it that I got a cat I'm really good that one other time and\nIt was in the living room she was swapped and it's something that wasn't there [noise] so I don't know if there's something paranormal going on in the house\nSo you believe in that stuff do you believe\nThe paranormal well I mean I I I I'm I have to that I started thinking about [laughter] a little more than usual\nYou don't know if you've had an experience like that then then uh it doesn't sound so strange due to the folks who have never had an experience or or the religious convictions tell them that that doesn't exist 'em\nTo somebody who's had something like that happened\nIt it can be mine over it it'd be really again I've I've I I'd I'd be the first to say I don't consider myself a matter of base but I have seen some things in my life that I I cannot explain and I don't know what they were and I don't know where they came from um and I and I question some of that stuff sometimes so I yeah\nI get exactly what it is you're saying hey thanks for the phone call appreciate it no probably yup\nJeremy you're up next year on TV or see what's the movie the the just does it for you when\nThe movie the desert for may outweigh nine years old and I watch misery\n... yeah that's a quote unquote theory movies that are completely implausible\nTo actually happen I have no problem it's the ones that are completely hold all\nMy belief that just I I Can't I Can't if it is completely and totally plausible for it to happen like I'm your number one fan you know just you know [noise] you know\nWhat was it about that movie that it was a Kathy Bates taken a sledgehammer to James guns ankles\nIt wasn't that it was the actuality the the ability for it to be in actuality [noise]\nSomebody to be getting men kit and think that it normal and this is what I Do not have any qualms about it because they know in their mind that it's right or a day okay [noise]\nThey they actual possibility of it happening\nLiterally just reads to me\nNow misery misery ... that's a Stephen King not just living doing\nSomething wrong with that do they say\nThat he wrote novels from nightmares\nWow can you imagine go through the lens ... I'm Sorry pardon I was gonna say do you do you imagine go through life with those kinds of nightmares\nI ... I I'm not one for suicide but my life would be rather short [laughter] do cab drivers\nIt would have had several heart attack by now\nNo kidding I mean that's a scary stuff fried Germany thanks for the phone call appreciate it three fifty years ago you bet seven with three two one two fifty nine fifty talking about scary movies you know there's a there's there's kind of a fine line between a movie that that scares you in a good way in a in a in a movie the kind of makes you put your pants\nI mean not literally but you're that scared I caught in Europe next you got a movie that makes you ...\nJimmy ... Yes sir Yes sir\nYeah hey yeah did you see the uh the the movie of the gun monitors pulling up the Ted Cruz signs that\n... he was kind of demented looking mostly kind of scary but yeah I don't think I'd want to get up he got he got a brain that guy's face it was filmed them\n... yeah that was right there in Houston\n\nYeah well I don't know if he's a liberal clown but ... is certainly a scary individual is is there a regular horror film though that is just so scary and your world that you would have a hard time watching it\nFor me it was I was I was a\nYoung when it came out this taco Norman Bates and his mom going Norman ... is that one that's all right that's scary movie\nI think you know for for each day to I Want to say that was probably what a early sixties maybe ... a ... to\nDo that when I was in the early nineties probably\n... able to do the original was a see who is in the original um Jamie Lee Curtis his mom was in the ... psycho yeah Alfred Hitchcock Alfred Hitchcock you know you're talking about the psychological thrillers I mean that was a genius at the at the building psychological thrillers no doubt about that\nNot gotten thanks for the call appreciate that very much by the way round the topic of this maybe we can wrap up your with this story here here's here's here's here is\nA Halloween story that also unfortunately\nInvolves one of those things in life I truly can say I hate the most which is over raw political correctness did you hear about this one Houston's museum of natural science has apologized for what they said was a questionable emails subject line\nThey issued a public apology after issuing are distributing as you say an issue of their bi weekly electronic newsletter with and I'm quoting from the Houston Chronicle now with what many would consider a racially offensive term\nSo what did they do well they put out they put out their newsletter about a a vet they've been putting on for the last ten years it's a whole week theme Halloween themed events they've been putting off for the last ten years and\nThe um the the uh\nThe subject line in the email was party was books\nNow I realize that you might be able to use the word spoke at a different conversation but it's pretty clear what they meant by the words move they were talking about ghost because it was it was Halloween they were not using a derogatory racial slur when they said the word ...\nBut the politically correct world we live in means that if you you you can no longer use words in the proper\nContext without somebody wanting to take a look at it is it's some sort of a racial statement which is ridiculous it was it was a tiger their annual Halloween party and they've been doing it for ten years it was supposed to be a refund
