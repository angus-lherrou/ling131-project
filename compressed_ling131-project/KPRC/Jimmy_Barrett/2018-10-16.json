{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Five zero I Want to talk about antifa than the looney laugh so let's talk about it um\nThis really should have been a bigger news story but it wasn't it's kind of upsetting that this wasn't a bigger news story makes you wonder not long ago on this radio show we broke a news story about something that happened right down the street from here over there at the Ted Cruz headquarters there was a news stories that Ted Cruz election campaign headquarters in Houston there was a news story about\nPossible hazmat situation rice and being sent to the campaign office and I turned out everybody was fine it was just a scare it was just it appears to be just some disgusting prank\nAnd as that was happening something very similar happened at the Pentagon same day probably not a coincidence if it was a coincidence boy that ... what would the odds statistically being of those two things just coincidentally happening the same day very unlikely now\nIf that was a coincidence that I'm sure that this is just a coincidence hazmat team was called to Bangor Maine to the house of Susan Collins Susan Collins as I'm sure you know is the senator from me and she\nKind of a controversial figure right now because of her confirmation of Kavanaugh she ended up supporting cabinet she delayed on it she was a little hesitant at first and she ended up giving the vote yes I'm Kevin Kevin now on the Supreme Court we we covered it on the show I Know you guys know the story about this now\nShe's hanging out at her house and and I guess they get a letter in the mail\nAnd inside of it is a letter in what appears to be rice and poison rice and we we talk about race it on the radio sometimes you guys have hurt us maybe play our minute rice and parity well hazardous material team was called the Bangor Maine the home of Senator Susan Collins Monday afternoon after a threatening letters containing what its author said was rice and was delivered their\nCollege spokesperson as Amy Clark\nAnd she got on Twitter she said that Collins and her husband Tom down for in the ... dog\nAnd parts of the home were quarantined while the letter was analyzed the dog the dog I hate to hear that leave the ... let's leave dogs out of this what ... what do we as humans do to deserve canines are so awesome and can't we just leave dogs alone I mean it's one thing ... to harass politicians that's bad enough\nBut when you put the family dog and it was it just bothers me I I hate reading that a dog was in trouble in the news story just tastes my mind to a bad place anyway outside the house the Bangor daily newspaper photographer took pictures of what was going on as a ... as a person in a hazmat suit\nHolding a novel up in a plastic bag walked out and later the FBI arrived along with bands caring people military uniforms\nOne force would officials were analyzing the kind of the letter in the investigation into its origins was ongoing as of yesterday I haven't heard the latest on this I actually just tried looking it up now to see what the latest was\nTend to get a lot of news coverage if this is Susan Collins was Elizabeth Warren this was the only thing you'd hear about today\nAm I wrong if I'm wrong call me and told me right now argue with me I Love when people argue with me I don't get enough people that want to call and argue with me anyway so there's an update on this but yeah Senator Susan Collins in her family being threatened because they nominated a relatively moderate Republican to Supreme Court confirmed I should say they didn't didn't denominator\nYeah that really bugs me as all this is happening there's another big news story today I think people need to take a look at project ... I Am I'm projects are causes a lot of critics you guys know that it's it's James O'Keefe screw up\nAnd they do kind of gotcha journalism they do undercover journalism\nWhere they try to trick Democrats into saying embarrassing things and sometimes I think those videos are very interesting and sometimes I think\nUh you know no offense to James O'Keefe sometimes I find the videos to be a big latte lackluster I Do not feel that way about this new video there's a new video out today about ... a Senator McCaskill you guys know that is Senator McCaskill ah from Missouri\nBasically very liberal very progressive Democrat actually and she has to policies that moderates and centrists are not going to embrace\nSo project ... undercover with her and some people and they're having a conversation with him and basically they get them to say what we all believe to be true the Democrats are withholding information\nAbout what they really want to do until after the ... one of the things they want to do is raise taxes so if your if your taxes aren't high enough right now and you want them to be higher but for the Democrats\nBut stay another really crazy ideas to gun control and\nThings that they want to do with open borders and\nGetting rid of ice now the Democrat insiders had been told to withhold some of their talking points particularly in red states or swing states were places where Democrats are holding officers but otherwise other than that Republicans are still popular in those states you know places like Ohio or Florida or you know places like Pennsylvania Wisconsin\nSo the plan among the Democrats as withhold some of this information until after the midterms\nImpeaching Trump would be a good example most moderates and centrists don't want Trump to get impeached they accept the election results and they don't want the election results to change now I'm gonna probably about thirty seconds for you of how this new video from Roger ... opens up once you're going to hear here is\nA bunch of people from Senator McCaskill's office talking about the policies that they actually embrace but they don't want people to know that the prices are secret policies I imagine if you and me and our other friends from the conservative and libertarian Republican movements had policies that we didn't want to publicly share with people they were secrets yeah after after we win the election you know we're gonna\nWe're going to exterminate all the lesbian Eskimos or whatever crazy policy it was okay so I imagine they're keeping it a secret now just listen to this audio and take that into consideration\nI can tell them because she does sort of semi automatic firemen because I Want to say something I shouldn't say I think semi automatic like semi automatic rifle\nMore soldiers were also\nTo get the moderate\n[noise] what are we found a moderate after we wrap [noise] [noise] yeah\nWhat do we tell the moderates after we dropped the impeachment hammer afterwards get over it\nOh okay so you're going to lie do you remember they did this with Wendy Davis Wendy Davis was the rising star of the Democratic party and she came out and said she was pro guns\nAnd then she got tanked by governor Abbott got absolutely figuratively speaking at her ... walked dude horrible and that election double digit loss she was supposed to be the new rising star of the DNC what happened she clashed now she's so obscuring irrelevant she couldn't get arrested if she tried to that's how\nThat's how much people don't notice the existence of Wendy Davis that's the future a beta or\nWendy Wendy Davis was in office when she was running for office she said she was pro guns and then as soon as she watched as soon as Greg Abbott beat her\nShe comes out and she goes you know what I lied\nShe she even admitted she said I was just trying to win and Texas how do you went in Texas when you're anti guns or the world hasn't changed much since what was that I don't\nAh I was at four years ago six years ago it was a twenty twelve the world has changed much since then and now we live in a country where ... work is trying to get that nomination imagine why now if you consider that Wendy Davis light\nIf you consider that ... that Senator McCaskill admits that they're lying about what their policies really are\nWhat do you think ... or ... not telling us about his policy positions she already has embraced open borders and socialism and gun control on the most extreme level what secrets do you think he's keeping from us\nThat he's waiting until after he loses to Ted Cruz to spill the beans on hey folks I only have thirty seconds here and then I got to go Jimmy parents coming up next\nReal quick reminder friday November second I have ...

a loan that is right for\nCall today in orange\n[noise] back to Jimmy Barron Barron song Katie RC nine fifty\nIt is a three thirty two now have you ever see him not to the gym a burden drive home led to join me here today we're doing the show from the Galleria\nOr some using the gallery enough from my home studios because there's no power in my house [laughter] and I have\nNo idea what had happened why don't they put that on the site by the way you all powered\nHere's what the powers a transformer blew some dumb ass driving the big drug knock down the utility poles yelling anything along those lines anything along those lines will be fine but no\nThey got nothing for me [noise] so anyway [laughter] hopefully spent like the one who's not backed by the time I get home I'm not going to be happy camper I'm not making those threats are nothing I'm just saying I Will be really happy [noise] um\nWe've been talking a little bit about uh the obesity problem and trying to cure it I'm here you know I I I'm hard pressed to say there's anything even approaching a cure because we all have different reasons\nWhy we eat what we eat um sometimes it's a matter of convenience you know if you want to trace the obesity problem I'm Alive scholar lip was blaming women you know I don't want he on I only want to go down that road I'm not blaming women by saying this\nBut I think where we really started to develop the issue was when we got to the point where we had both parents working and both coming home from work and both coming home from work tired and it just became a matter of convenience\nI think that's how it began\nBecause people were just too tired and it was just it was easier to go through the drive through and pick something up and go home and eat it or to call for pizza\nAs a whole lot easier to do doesn't require nearly as much effort and um\nYou know you you don't want to spend an arm and a leg on dinner every night and eating out as much more expensive generally speaking much more expensive than cooking cooking yourself so it just became kind of a matter of convenience and\nWe ended up going to the fast food and the beats in that kind of stuff because he was an overly expensive it's something we could old Ford eating all Ford to do\nBut I think that's all began but I think out mushrooms after that\nIs then you had a whole generation of kids who are being raised in a household where very rarely eat at home\nYou know some some pre made was dumped into a bag for using the school and then when you got home to the empty house in her hanging out playing video games I'm nobody's cooking anything\nAnd nobody really knows how to cook is a you know it's it's it's amazing\nHow few people know how to cook anymore not I'm not talking about you know restaurant quality about about talking about a Julia Child I'm not talking about that\nI'm just talking about making something fairly fairly basic\nYou know we we haven't put much of a premium that any more for some reason\n[noise] so solving the problem is easier said than done when it comes to that you know one one thing I saw one thing I saw this very cool that will do this a little bit later speaking again it's a food story but tell me this is a fascinating how to best pair your Halloween candy with wine\n[laughter] really what goes with Skittles so I'm a I'm a get into that you know 'cause I'm I'm curious now I have to admit I have to admit I might try some of those\nJust to see if it actually works All right we have a a guess joined us now three thirty six year on Cape Cod I'm nine fifties name is Robyn Armstrong use ... for the RMC we had him on this morning I get to your age and we talk to him about a lot of things that the least of which is the attitude on the left\nAnd how it's continuing to impact the attitude on the right is Robin who's the attitude on all it gets worse than Moore's sooner more\nCalls for violence rudeness being crass will push back um overthrow all these kinds of words keep working their way into the lexicon I I I had the sneaking suspicion that the ultimate result of this is the more people on the writer who to start behaving that way themselves\n[laughter] well you know I certainly going to have your sales you know I\nI I Know that that the laughter your score I mean they're they're going to shift the president's going loco that last year on and it's fighting against is present in working so hard Petersburg or their paper they're unable to work in\nSpite of this campaign um\nYou know ... ... talk crudely about his wife about him and his family the topic of the term they they've got all these things are kind of on the line here it occurs and I'll say it they're just like with a successful people where\nI ... I picked up seats in the Senate discover this term election uh looks like we're holding on to the house when I say it's just you know the attack Rick cabinet viciously ... you've had unsubstantiated claims against it was just\nAmazing that the Democrats have just lost their minds and and I believe that that because of that you know we Republicans going to fight harder I mean we're going to stay engaged before it ... how to combat this foolish and protect our failures basically\nRobyn do do you think do you think the whole Brett Kavanaugh thing was the straw that broke the camel's back\nI think it is I think the great ...\nAnd like like they did just just so [noise] every person every male in this country is saying to themselves you know you know\nWhat what is going on here how can someone get taxed for something they did\nAt Seventeen years old or or something they didn't give theater did do at Seventeen years old searched is used how can someone make up ... claims like this and it ... it and every one of the video is true you know ... and we are are are are based\nYou know they have ... brother used to\nSay that and so I think that Republicans ... even independent people who say ... percent holding shows that that that Brett Kavanaugh was treated unfairly independent minded people even even\nReasonable response ... Democrats I'm studying it was no way that you can hold as a whole\nYou from going on in court because these unsubstantiated accusations that they'll cooperate again there's no way it is just a basic sense of unfairness and people just thought I'd say it's not right what's happening and and all the Democrats are doing this for political purposes\nYou all had to I had left today I don't know if you saw this or not did you see what the Stormy Daniels was called by President Trump what he said about her I did I did\n[laughter] see online like normally I Would be in a sense by this but the way they treat them I think that's the key to this is that the president's been so poorly treated he can get away with calling somebody a horse race\nNow you're so I I think ... very well\nZero is really interesting to me that even in Texas most of the Democratic candidates who are running\nAre good you know traditional southern Democrats they are uh they are very much to the left they're very very close do you have to being you know either in the ... the light mind bronco bum or in some cases even for the love the map\nBut right absolutely and I I'll tell you they they are you supposed to hit\nThat they were to the left and ... and that's what ... what we're seeing is that is that it in these races all over the country these congressional races were still at the Democrats\nHave nominated some of the most that this socialist candidates that they could have and that bodes well for us running against them and a lot of these races were having to to defense seats that\nHillary Clinton lawn and so I I think we're going to be in good shape I think that that that work is no different uh he had to win the primary been difficult primary is is wait till the last of even even mainstream Democrats at Texas so I you know he would\n... I think that we're going to do very where I get that crude if probably plead the fifth day for ... ... that's got to help everybody down ballot as well\nYou know I I noticed earlier a Robin ... earlier this half hour you were sounding really really bullish on keeping control the house and even picking up seats in the Senate or using some sort of internal polling data from the Republican National committee that will tell you that that things are going in that direction\nYou don't you know I I totally data for both his certainly the city it certainly looks like we'll pick up three seats\nI'm Heidi Heitkamp of predict or hurt or record will pick up the areas where there are ... will will have access to pick up a Florida actually as well with the governor of Florida friday there\nSo I said oh picked up potentially pick up those three states either bored as the kids to go a little further in our direction or the house seats houses were support because we've got a ... house members Republican Souter resigning who have been an issue though\nA Democrat seats but just to get into that seat for such a long period of time that the Democrats kept electing so those were ... we have quite a bit of a fight in those seats but I think that that there's a chance that we put lives our seats but I think\nThe ... ask really looks like you know we're going to be able to hold on to the house that that's just a prediction you know take that for what it's worth but I certainly think that that the Tribune website where we're going to do pretty well\nOn the sixteenth maintain control the house is the most important issue here because absolutely we don't we do we know what's going to happen is going to be impeachment city as far as I'm trying to get rid of Donald Trump and then uh then but wouldn't be surprised that Brett Kavanaugh is next on the list\nAre absolutely absolutely that is they're playing it on the thoughts was voter base and and we were motivated to see that we saw how they treated a justice Tylenol his hearings and and we know that that those ...\nActs that we could even be ... so they understand that that the president certainly you'll be all of the next on the impeachment list and and so we know that that\nThe the the closer you use a radical left us from San Francisco I'm a vote for any Democrat whether it's in Dallas or Houston to San Antonio ... for ... she gets a vote for San Francisco in California and so ... in Texas is just not going to do there\nAre we're not going to go there and our Senate race in Iraq last time says governors' races\nOr any other race or state while how to balance a Texas aren't convinced that the Democrats are way out of touch with our values with Texas values and and that's why I think we're going to have a good ... election\nAll right I'm among assume you're right about all this because that's exactly what I Want to hear 'em and if that's the case let's talk about twenty nine team in what are the issues that should be the top of the president has to do is I I Know one that's on my mind I don't hear people talk about it at all\nA unit goes along with his story that the feds collected record individual income taxes and twenty Eighteen but we're still running of the seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollar deficit when are we try to move a balancing the budget getting rid of the deficit back up towards the top the list\nWell you know I think that that's going to\nBe extremely or are we we we have we go down there so there's really not where we should not be focusing on on reducing ... everyone wants a job she\nHas the opportunity to get a job there's no reason why we should not have some sort of substantial will want to get people back to work it gets to do that you will get them off of covered it well you know I think that that we can also you were about you\nAnd we just get great savings for God as well which is a budget buster Medicaid expansion it's so it's so certainly you'll go barbecue here we were going to\nBe able to help the budget gaps that I'm getting folks will getting folks into the job training programs jobs they were they were going to open it so I think that's a core issue\nBut I think if you just have good public policy that they were ... ... it's essential to our children are glued to\nThe production Robin on what the voter turnout is going to be for the midterm what percentage would you put to do going\nOh boy I tell you I I you know look at it close to normal but sixty sixty five\nOr more people are surprised yeah um I I think it's going to be hyper\nTurnout because that they were highly motivated Republican urban\nAbove the Democrats take control of giving motivated just treat it so it so I think we're going to have a harbor for\nYeah it's a shame but ... is a great motivating force all the way round isn't it right absolutely yeah All right Robin good to hear from user you have a great Dane thanks

I think he's just obsessed in it I think the byproduct gives these keeping all those promises he made but I think he's obsessed and we saw that is he was running for office I think he's obsessed he was obsessed with winning and then he was obsessed with being one of the greatest presidents ever\nI I I think that's true and yes he has a style that we're certainly not used\nTo but we're getting more used to it on our way\nWe are well because people I think Trump I understand people like success and you know the Democrats of and rooting for the stock market crash\nAnd you know he had a couple of rough days last week but it looks like the earnings season is continuing to go well so stocks are going up which is part of his message and what he and his party should be running on is\nWe've got the economy really moving and we've got we've gotten to America back to work and it used to be\nA when Bill Clinton was president it was all about the economy and it used to be the that was the case and I guess that would be true and if the economy wasn't doing so well the Democrats would be blast and tromp on the economy but they don't have as an issue so they don't talk about it\nIn fact I'm trying to figure out what they're running on besides being against Donald Trump\nThat's that's pretty much it paid for Donald Trump and are getting a lot of support from the Hollywood elite they're getting a lot of support from a you know the ... the far left certainly and you know all the gloves do is you know Gary ... have come off where there's no pretends anymore there's no diplomacy work on any of those anymore it's just pushing and shoving\nProtest in ... um vandalizing it is amazing the the the the way certain people in this country of justify their behavior dates like ... it's the um the the the end justifies the means in their mind\nWhich is really quite astounding and and quite scary or for the future of our democracy in my opinion and this is if you study history and I understand that in our in the current state of public education in America not a lot of studying history happens but in the late thirties in Germany there was a night called crystalline\nWhere the wild moms went crazy in this case they were attacking Jewish Jewish or houses of worship or in a Jewish homes and Jewish businesses\nBut it was still this kind of crazy irrational nutty mob behavior right and what happened down the line of course was the you know the biggest killing machine in the history of the world World War two\nSix million Jews and gypsies and gays and others the Nazis didn't like were murdered in concentration camps but this all starts with this mentality that the people on the other side are should be\nShouted down she'll be abused but then that really human it's the same mentality and it's really scary\nIs um and course we're we're we're seeing that I'm with movements like antifa we're seeing that we're seeing we're seeing it as close as Austin right now you saw what happened in Austin right now with the big guys right\nYes I mean that's a that's also that's Texas you all this happening right here in\nTexas last and in fairness we were going to build a wall around anything in Texas it would probably be Austin right\nOff on politics are quite bizarre\nJust to try to contain it all we do build big tall maybe that's where the first of all should be built\nIt could it does is doing well economically I guess\nMaybe that for that reason they don't care but you know what I don't understand is the entity live the let leftist don't leftist or even a seal you which is to defend unpopular causes\nThey've gone off the deep end or you have other groups that used to be fighting for civil rights like the Southern Poverty Law Center that's now interested in excluding groups and individuals from rational debate by calling them racist\nOr and they have done that over and over again and then pressure businesses to cut off access to credit cards and banking and the like to them this is absolute in in insanity and what's the worst the worst Jimmy is the Democratic leadership has not called a halt to in fact they are aiding and abetting that's what's the worst\nWell there it sounds like your friends leave what's different what's really different is how they're encouraging it\nLive they're calling for its\nThey're [laughter] they're they're they're begging your participation in acting up and uh you know preventing ...", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "16"}
