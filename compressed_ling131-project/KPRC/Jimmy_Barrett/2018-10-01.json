and I see this hand coming over the fence spraying round up we've got some vines that come up you know these bind to come up with these little blue flowers on them\nAnd they come up on both sides of the fence system so I guess the neighbors annoyed at that but\nThe problem is they're spraying to round up on my rose Bush has also so I opened the window and hey please don't kill my roses you know so I I get myself to put back together and I go out there\nAnd get the water it was just try to round up off of my rose Bush is well the next year year later I see\nSee the other person from the from the household behind me doing the same thing\nAs something out this year they're both retired and that was mine came up again this year and they're dead now I guess I didn't see them spraying around if this year but\nYeah it's you know they spray roundup because they don't like what's going on the fence and they don't they don't bother they don't seem to mind that that killing your relatives or not you\nKnow if you directly in front of them about this\nYeah open the window and started yelling at him I said hey come on I got roses out there\nIn well you know please don't they they they went back in the house okay did you think about all the cops on them\nI didn't but yeah and and and the bad thing now she's on the age of bored\nHoles overheard [laughter] she's the new age away Nazi yeah that's right [noise] man oh man here's the thing is here's here's the other part of it they learn they they they got you exposed to a classy carcinogen you've heard the reports about roundup and cancer right\nRight they're spraying cancer causing materials on your property\nExactly and that's why they had a letter on [laughter]\nFor the ... pretty soon man people are bold aren't they\nAre at let's grab another when Mike in Jersey City Mike what's your complaint was happening to me oh you do it but I Love the show\nMan excellent about my uh [noise] want to tell you about my little dog little it's a ten year old little Chihuahua wouldn't find a biscuit and and I went outside took her outside of the back and ah I live in an apartment complex for a little patch of grass you know and that's where the she goes the party and or business you know\nAnd then this guy walked by with a big pit bull and he's like hey man you ought to take your dog or put on a leash and I and um I I understand that the law and all that but come on man it's like a little you know\nAll right you're ... you're hurting anybody and he's really yelling at me and I'm forty five years old man I'm Out in the best shape in the world and there's guys like a big muscle bound guy he's coming at me like\nYou know like he's going to hurt me or something like that you know and I'm like you know I'm not trying to be a ... I'm like well you know even you know you talked to me like that you know and\nHe's like yelling at me and him and you know and I'm like the girl didn't even after this I open the back door and let her back here I felt the dog coming up I don't want my daughter to get hurt so our\n... going up and she went in friday's still wants to get my face used to be confronted towards me you know I'm like why are you still angry at me you know why why are you still married we are are are are resolved that problem either way so one of the problem\nMaybe that's maybe that's the reason don't you think maybe that's the reason why why people um you know resort to call the police versus you know talking to a neighbor especially if it's ... really don't know because they just don't know what kind of a person that we don't know how they're going to react they don't know if they're going to you know try to get in their face and cause trouble\nYeah that was probably felt about it but I'll be the first one to get your face re in my face you know very you know but I'm not I don't want to go there but you're kind of you know force my hand on that one you know an hour and be with my now happy from my neighbor and so it's like\nOkay I'm Sorry to hear that man thanks for calling me and I do appreciate that very much yeah it's funny you know I'm ... you can uh you can't pick your your neighbors Kenya\nFor no other reason than the neighbors you have when you buy the house five years later they may all be difference\nBecause let's face it uses a very transit town and people come and go and then uh you know I've got probably three or four new neighbors in the last year because the homes have been so people you know transferring in people transferring out that type of thing\nThat's maybe part of the reason why we're not quite so tied in this neighborhood as well because we have people come and go with all the time and a lot of times they're coming from from somewhere else and it it takes a while it takes a while to kind of get used to things that takes a while to got to just kind of get your legs underneath you as far as uh you know where everything is and what do you try to do\nHey nothing else maybe you could make a pledge they divide it'd be a better neighborhood maybe\nYour neighbor will be a little bit better to you as well part of the problem is the capital updating and we will

just as important to have it and to have everything covered that we need to have it covered in case something happens fire whatever maybe lightning strike hailstorm\nTheft all those types of things you know that it's just that we don't put a whole lot of thought into her home owner's insurance usually what we do is we we set up some sort of a policy woman by the house and then it just kind of renews itself every year and we pay more for it every year and we just figure that's the way it's gotta be\nTurns out all of us over paying for homeowners insurance in fact it's not unusual for for families around Houston to spend six seven eight hundred dollars a year more than they need to for a really great homeowner's coverage it's just that they don't do anything about\nIt once they get the policy well that's where the folks had built vice who come in they now sell their own home owner's insurance\nAnd it's easy if you to save money back to his easiest taxing the word save and save the

bill advisor dot com for thirty four now or the Jimmy bird show I I found this survey really interesting and I wanted to take a little more time than when I had to do with it this morning and that is how we define what well off is\nWhat do you consider to be well off and do it varies obviously depending upon your age or where you are in life um\nHow much money you feel like you have to have set aside you know for a rainy day all those kinds of things it's a it's a moving target\nBut what they did the study and they compare generation X ers the millennials to baby boomers and they found some interesting things my ground joins us with comedy that by the folks who did the survey what was the most interesting thing you think you've found a new survey by like\n... ... the first thing we did when we talk to on right now folks in the interview and then we asked them what they consider themselves well off and\nThe fact they're not and then over three different groups the millennials which has a little surprising found themselves for each or ... they were the most well off again after like twenty nine percent of them\nAnd thirty four percent of the baby boomers so we thought that the kind of interesting yeah yeah I mean we we took it one step further and we asked them well what we\nConsider to be well off and why are you in Egypt I've had a different perspective\nThan the millennials you know they want it to be that great you know get free your well off in pay your bills on time you're well off and you could afford experience is that those kind of a travel concert the stature that for that so\nYeah that's gotta be uniquely millennial thing they like experiences I'd never even really available that bed until I heard them used the term but you're talking about like um\nWhat like helicopter tours of the Grand Canyon or are going to the Hawaiian Islands ... you know the travel a lot of things having to do with travel writer and or or or things that you um a normal person can't necessarily get\nExactly going to the final four you know knowing or something unique horse race I mean those are those are the things that they can they can afford them and they're throwing themselves\nThat within their top three nobody knows when they ... they ... themselves it appears that those people are a lot\nI like the debt free living part because I think that's where uh where a lot of baby boomers have made a mistake is um you know your game credit card debt and all that stuff so for for a lot of us we still have credit card debt to pay off if you have a mortgage you still have to pay off\nPlus you know retirement is getting you we didn't do good job of saving for retirement so now we're getting down to the nitty gritty I can see why baby boomers are scoring lower we were just running out of the time\n[laughter] I area area and the baby boomer there they're much more practical\nThe top three ... that\nThey considered themselves the well off it was much more pride they have to have a solid investment portfolio or an established retirement funds so and you're looking at your parents and we're not talking about experienced any more I Want to be able to retire and I want to be able to almost all my friends that I don't know\nAnd I'm settled so it was it was very different from from the millennials yeah\nWell there's just a normal part of the process where there's some things in there that really kind of surprise you though as far as um\nThe attitudes these different generations have about what the future is going to be like in in the reason why I asked the question\nIs for baby boomers somehow despite you know twenty or thirty four more years of being told Social Security might not be around for us clearly Social Security is going to be around for us but I'm guessing that the the next set of generations coming up\nNot only do they have to deal with the fact that Social Security might not be there for them uh the the corporate pension or the factory pension that so many baby boomers got on the tail end on he's not going to be there for me there\nIt's a great point and went to the ... the difference\nBetween the millennials in the ... when you're saying that is that the millennials are eight and they're saying they're hearing all these things and they're not even thinking about homeownership as a uh as as class find themselves as well I think what you're talking about it impacting their thought process there\nThey're saying we're you know if I can afford experiences living trick today versus the the the ... which one of their top grade was homeownership now is the classic if I have my home that I made it I don't think the millennials are thinking that same way anymore\nYou find that this is constantly moving target of the reason why I asked the question Mike Brown is because I Know that when I was a Thirty Years' old I was saying to myself if I could just make this amount per year I'm going to be well off I'm going to be comfortable and then that every every five to ten years that that kept moving up in up in up\nAnd no matter how high it's gotten I've never quite gotten to where the next level is\nHarry I'm In I'm In the same place and what what happens is we did ask that type of questions to the folks here and we said you know if you are and what the average amount of money at it with me he considered well off\nAnd the baby boomers staying in the savings they needed\nNine thousand dollars a well off and the jet actors are pretty close to there were sixty five thousand\nAnd the millennials for fifty four so I I was a little surprised that the millennials close there so that the now it would need I I I Would have thought that they would have thought it a little bit higher but no I think I'm a little bit of what you're talking about before can be impacting what's going on there\nI I'm a little surprised with it too because we're told the the the kids coming out of college now that the all think we should be getting one hundred thousand dollar or your jobs right on the couch", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "01"}
