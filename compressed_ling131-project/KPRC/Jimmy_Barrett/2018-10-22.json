E. W. E. N.\nDot com if you care to join us on the air today we'd love to hear from him so this is um it's about two things really today at Toyota Center it's about the president of the United\nStates getting some more love 'cause he needs him some more loving he likes he feeds off the crowds that's pretty obvious and he's especially when you have a crowd that that is that large that are showing up to support you can you think of any other time in American history that this many people would show up to her president\nI Can't I Can't even imagine\nNow maybe you could go back to the Kennedy mystique\nShow for a parade or something but as far as people showing up at a rally\nDo generally show their support for somebody it's hard to imagine anybody attracting more of a crowd than Donald Trump is attracting here in Houston I have to admit even I'm surprised by the numbers hundred thousand people\nAnd ah as again ... mainly a sea of red is what you're gonna buy down there many of the attendees were told by the way drove from\nHours away many people lined up overnight in order to make sure they were going to get spotted the rally because they only sits like is it sits Eighteen thousand Eighteen thousand people\nThose attending the rally by\nThe way we're asked some of them were asked how they felt about the Trump cruise few because this you know part of the reason why is here is to bolster the campaign to sit at a cruise\nAnd I think a lot of people understand that politics or politics in in people's view didn't they say in the heat of battle they say things they don't even necessarily mean but they said for a fact and nobody does that more than doubled Trump\nThan saying things for affect me as a master show up and we'll get right down to it and let's face it Hillary in Iraq they weren't exactly a best buds by the time Obama stole the nomination away from her the when when he ran\nSo you've got a lot of that stuff going on there was a guy who lives in mission who chairs the Rio Grande valley chapter of Latinos for Trump he got into town two o'clock yesterday afternoon in line by four pm drove seven hours how many people would do this\nHow many people would get a car drive seven hours stand in line all night long to insure you get a spot in a rally\nOne that you could easily see the highlights on TV\nIt's an amazing effect I Can't think of anybody else who could possibly pull this off seven won three two\nOne two fifty nine fifty by the way if you'd like to join me here on Cape Cod and or if you are in the area or you're attending the rally\nIt just happened to be listening on your cell phone or what have you ah we would we would love to hear from me did I get a little scenes that are funded by the way the president's approval ratings\nAre ahead of where bronco bomber was at the same point in his presidency after having been elected the first time going into the midterm election the president's approval ratings are two points higher than what's Brock Obama's were\nHighest level of that poll yet forty seven percent this is the NBC Wall Street Journal poll which is not exactly been climb a time they should say or to the president or the Republicans\nI think uh most of us realize that the folks at NBC able to a little different slant that most of us have his approval rating\nWas at a record low Obama's approval rating I should say was a record low in October twenty can just before they the Democrats lost a significant number of seats in the house and Senate while the president is historically high for him\nAnd endorse I'd be the first to say there is a huge disconnect we all know that he's got about Ninety percent approval rating from Republicans and he's got about Ninety percent disapproval right from Democrats it doesn't get a whole lot different than that\nIt's just it's just it's just the divided world in which we live so here's the question\nHow will this translate into voter turnout how will this translate is is because we're getting close we're just a few weeks away from the November election and clearly to me\nI don't know if the Democrats have lost any seem as far as people turning out to vote but I have to say\nThat conservatives and Republicans have picked up\nSteam this this rally here in Houston this rally reminds me of this\nThis rally shows me how much enthusiasm there is going into this election and here we're here's where I think the differences and knew it we've been talking about this for weeks here's why I really believe the differences here I really do believe\nThat the enthusiasm is higher for Republicans than it is for Democrats and historically speaking\nRepublicans are much more inclined to turn out to show up to actually come to the polls and votes\nWhere Democrats especially young Democrats have a tendency to talk a good game but when it comes to actually showing up and doing something it's a whole different deal [noise]\nSeven laundry

Williams flip to a guilty plea and resigned in the middle of his corruption trial against serving a five year sentence immediately\nAll things considered we have a pretty good in America if you look at the rapid corruption of countries around the world you'll see everything is relative still many states look bad when you examine how they handle political campaigns set budgets and manage ethics violations so\nAfter a a Center for Public Integrity US News and World Report reports they came up with the Fifteen most corrupt states in America\nNow\nI'm looking at number Fifteen and who do I see Texas here's what they said about the Lone Star state\nIs when you get a D modest in school you're one take away from failure that's where the government the Texas landed on integrity issues in this study Lone Star state received poor marks in lobbying disclosures\nElection oversight and accountability from the governor and legislature but Texas failed worst of all and giving the public access to records\nIf you don't know elected officials they've done you can't hold them accountable and I must say that I have we've seen some estimates of that that we not where I'm especially and things like voting records where they don't want to open them up they don't want to share any information they don't want anybody to have the ability to check\nOn weather we've had legal voting\nHere in the state of Texas so that that's always versus ... I'm sure you've heard about the Texas Democrats we certainly talked about on the show towards the tail end of last week\nAnd the governor's ball governor Abbott has vowed to get involved in investigating this where we had a situation where voter registration forms were being filled out\nUm were passed out only two things were filled out in advance both with yes answers are you a citizen the United states\nAnd are you Eighteen or older and therefore eligible to vote in both cases that they were pre filled out yes and then these applications were passed out\nIn a part of Texas where there would be a fairly high concentration to people who are likely were not eligible to vote now the Democrats haven't really did I doing this the only thing they've really done is but the onus back on the people\nWho fill out those forms and turn them in in other words let's say you've got somebody with limited English skills and they don't really understand what it is they're being pressured to sign something fill out the rest of it in sign it and they don't realize that what they're doing if they're not as this in\nThe United states is illegal now you put them on the spot and Democrats don't seem to have any problem doing that\nThey don't have any ... the people they're supposedly trying to help protect they don't seem to have any problem putting them in harm's way they're the ones that are going to pay the price for that they're the ones that we get prosecuted our number fourteen a list Vermont yeah Vermont\nSays in some respects Vermont serves as a model for ethical government\nBribery investigations are virtually nonexistent\nAnd politicians do begin working as a lobbyist the day the term ends over this tradition left to hold an ethics investigations Vermont basically works on an honor system that it never happened they haven't created an ethics unit that just doesn't work especially in the Citizens United\nEra so that's what they're being criticized for you know it's amazing how many things out of state by state basis are done on an author system including our voting\nIf you if you say\nYour United States as an adult form you will be allowed to vote nobody will ask you for any for now here in Texas back to the Supreme Court we're going to ask for proper identification so you are who you say you are but that still doesn't go nearly far enough and making sure that we know for sure that you're a night states citizen\nBefore you vote where where\nDo we live in a world where we can continue to honor if you will be under system is the honest system

really do specialize in\nBed stains in bed orders I began to book your next work and to get more information go to loops steam dot com it's O O P s steam dot\nCom All right I'm I'm just sort of I got to admit passively interested in what's going on with the Saudis only because it you know I think I'm less interested in that I Would have been a now that we are taking\nCare of our own oil needs I think that has a lot to do with my lack of interest there I used to I used to read a little bit over what's going on this or Saudi Arabia over fear what they might do door oil supply and the price of oil the price of gasoline but we're falling so much oil on the ground here in Texas I'm not nearly as worried as I used to be about these things\nNor do I feel that were dailies depend on the Saudis as we used to be nor do I think they're particularly good ally they're only good ally if you compare to him to somebody like Iraq\nOr Iran especially Iran then\nThey come across as a fairly good ally because at least most of the time they seem to be dealing with with us in a fairly open up way currently they are not\nI mean there's no mistake about when it comes to this murder of ... there's no doubt there a line left and right I mean how many different answers that they come up with so far about what happened to this guy the first key to being a good liar\nIs you have to be able to keep your story straight\nIf you're telling a different story all the time you know it's a lie so their line their pants off or whatever there's they're wearing over their\nTheir line their line left in rights they are not giving us the straits getting of what happened now the question is considering the fact that ...\nIs not a United States citizen was merely working as a columnist for the Washington Post\nHow much involvement should we have as far as investigating what happened to him aside from putting the necessary pressure on just tried to make sure that there is some sort of a fair and balanced type of investigations is doesn't get just swept under the rug\nBut I Wonder what we can do about this and by the way I'm not the only one of the question is the whole thing about stories obviously everybody does including this guy with a Brookings issued his name was shut dean Hamid talking about how this all these stories have changed over and over again to what happened to Joe Palca show he\n... you know it's hard to take these claims seriously I mean the Saudis have been changing their story almost every day we've had three or four different iterations of this\nFirst there was a shouting in the last to back and trends then we heard the ... killing theory now it's the failed abduction theory so now we hear about a fist fight with a sixteen year old\nGuy and there's apparently Fifteen or sixteen Saudi officials [noise] so I mean it it's hard it's hard to take that seriously and I think that's why many of us here in the U.S are we feel like we've been been disrespected that the Saudis are basically not telling us the truth or to put it in the last thing on my sleeve lying\nAnd not just not just to Americans but specifically to the president specifically to senior U.S officials\nAnd after we've done so much for the Saudis over the past years\nFor them to kind of return with this level of disrespect [noise] um I don't think I don't think we'd like being taken it as fools and that's what it seems like seems like the Saudis are our assuming\nThat showed us any respect\n\nNo respect no respect it'll it'll just the Rodney Dangerfield ribbon well\nMaybe somebody inside the administration does know the truth maybe maybe they leveled I thought it was interesting that the crown prince who's under a lot of pressure and all this called the family evidently today if she'll get to a [noise]\nA share his concerns I don't know that he apologized for whatever and I think he might have\nUm there's probably very small cell was to the family of course it's the big rumors that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia himself had something to do with this uh-huh that's what they're saying anyway [noise]\nSenator Lindsey Graham by the way is also not buying the Saudi explanation about what happened\nUh I don't think as credible at all it's ridiculous to blame that Eighteen people would go to turkey or to kill a\nKill Mexicans hoagie and nobody in the government know about it that that would be brazen abuse of authority um\nHe was clearly murdered in a conflict things like that don't happen in Saudi Arabia without paying for the top knowing we'll find out more I like the president's measured response I liked the idea that he wants to consult with Congress about what to do\nThere are an ally but they need us more than we need them\nUp as much as ... would say the fish rocks from the head down that's how that works ground\nPrince of Saudi Arabia has to have something to do with it right is hands have got to be dirty so we'll see\nWe'll see if we can get to the bottom of it and I'm ... years the question though what are we going to do about it if it turns out that he ordered the guy murdered these the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nYou're we're certainly not going to go into Saudi Arabia and removed from power right of course not what are we going to demand that they do and what are they going to do in order to try to make things right well how do you make things right when you basically murders somebody like that\nAnd they had who they have they had a video surveillance of the guy who put on a ... clothing\nAfter he was at the embassy
