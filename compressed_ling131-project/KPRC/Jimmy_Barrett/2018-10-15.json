Omar\nPolish repair guy or you know even\nRight what would er Ming the Chinese laundry Matt employee or whatever right there's different kinds of illegal immigrants we understand that in my stereotyping too much about him like that could be you know it could be it could be it could be sky alert the Canadian pot sales man there's all kinds of illegal immigrants a dozen\nPeople you could come here illegally from any country I'm just trying to make sure we've got 'em all\nUp more picked out there will well this is about\nMS Thirteen and and and the cartel gunmen right those are the people that we want deported right the New York times reports that the strategy and playing a growing number of races maybe working\nAs a tight battle for control of Congress enters its closing weeks Democrats have found that it's politically competitive states red states swing states particularly ones where Mr Trump did well in twenty six team that they need the why a little bit about what they think don't talk about how you defend sanctuary cities\nThis is this is the playbook right now well it must be working have you guys heard about\nStacey Abrams Stacey Abrams is the gubernatorial candidates from Port up\nShe said something amazing yesterday over the weekend she was doing the rounds on the cable TV talking had shows and she said the blue way it was coming and it's coming because of illegal immigrants\nMore why why why did you get what that means folks what she's saying and the sound bite is that the Democrats are going to win\nNext month of November because undocumented illegal immigrants are going to vote would you turn the computer and places like\nThe thing is a blue wave is African American\nWhy it's not like this and the guy\nAre not worthy of being there\nWere documenting an undocumented\nWow it's it's comprised of what\nI guess that I mean she's being honest with their constituents I guess maybe she wants to lie to the press it just seems like a pretty big news story a high ranking member of the Democratic party is out there telling people that the Democrats are going to win 'cause they're gonna cheat\nSo your Google Stacey Abrams name\nSomething kind of suspicious happens here you don't see any news stories about this you literally see none um news story I just did a Google Search here Stacey Abrams declines to endorse Eric Holder's controversial kick comment\nStacey Abrams where states ... stands on transportation is issues Stacey Abrams heads out on a bus tour these are nice headlines but where's the big news story this is a pretty big news story\nIn the meantime this woman thanks voter ID laws are meant to scare people out of boating\nVoter ID laws are supposed to keep people from voting illegally and that's it you eat a voter id\nIf you need an id to vote it it it's seems like a pretty easy justification to me we don't want people to cheat on voting right\nThink about it you need a an ID to get a welfare check in an idea to buy a gun you need an ID to drive a car ... to go outside and get some cigarettes you need an ID to get sued affect\nYou need an idea to drive a moped right don't you in some states I guess not at all of them are the point\nIs that smokes and I do to get people to vote isn't supposed to be racist there's nothing racist about it unless of course you are trying to encourage people to cheat and then I guess it is\n[laughter] I [laughter] I Can't even believe there's an argument about this this this stuff the Democrats actually agreed on back in the nineties when their guy Bill Clinton was pro build a wall and pro immigration reform and now they're against all this stuff\nWell it turns out there is a good reason that we want these laws for women in\nFort Worth or have been arrested and indicted on charges related to an organized voter fraud with\nWhat they do they exploited old people\nThis happened in Texas this happened at Fort Worth four women were arrested here's what their names were Letitia Sanchez Letitia Sanchez ... they have the same name but like an extra last name is Maria solace and more power they were indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud\nThe attorney general's office as these people allegedly were paid to target older voters on the north side of the city in Fort Worth it was a scheme it was supposed to generate a large number of mail ballots they were going to harvest those ballots for specific candidates and\nTwenty sixteen gosh I Wonder which candidates I Wonder if they were Tea Party candidates [laughter] I Wonder if they were neo cons I doubt it the attorney general's office explains that the applications\nFor mail in ballots are first sent a targeted precincts been harvester is attempt either intercept the ballots outright or assist elderly voters\nIn voting their ballots while ensuring that the votes are cast for the candidates the harbor stirs choice oh well gosh [laughter]\nSounds like they're doing something illegal to me man in a lot of cases the attorney general's office official says the voters do not even know their votes have been stolen investigators began looking into a Fort Worth voter fraud ring and found that the so called fraudulent applicants are applications were created by forging signatures\nThey changed information on the applications and then they would reach submit them without the knowledge of the voters they didn't even tell these people oh yeah we changed your boat resubmitted don't worry about it you're all just sit in this home and shut up about it\nSpeaking of shut up can somebody tell Hollywood to shut up Hollywood\nIs never short on this a disappointment I got this new movie out right now it's called first man first man is a movie about now so that doesn't include a flag planting seen it lost this weekend the venom maybe a movie with the worst special effects ever here's the trailer the first man [noise]\nComing soon to a theater near you\nUniversal pictures present it's first man the story of an astronaut from some was country travels all the way to the mood and helps in anonymously should space program achieved victory against some other down to his nation which countries are there doesn't matter\nThe Academy Award winning actor Ryan Gosling what you've never seen them before portraying the role of Neil Armstrong and astronaut from the national we're on the space of registration\nWhich is the official space program of some country who doesn't matter who the plotline your job will drop or should witness Ryan Gosling walk on the moon and not quite to flag on its surface because why would we include that\nIt's not really that important to relax you won't even missed the flag so goes the first man\nThe story of an astronaut from the space program\nRussia didn't have to show we'll see you tomorrow\nAnd setting a B or C Houston and I are radio\nGallery America studios will go get your sea knowing that the [noise]\n\nThe damage is incredible on the ... Fox News that from President Trump after taking an aerial tour of the Florida Panhandle whole communities were devastated by hurricane Michael\nWas still the place that people went than they shop and I mean there are certain things you went to go get it seniors\nYou always got a but what do you take a look at the history of the company and what it meant to so many people from its inception of the late Eighteen hundreds into the Nineteen twenties into particular um the Nineteen thirties and post World war two\nThey really meant a lot to people that was Sears was a big deal thanks mainly I guess to the Sears catalog which was the big deal because one of the companies started the company started out there were no shopping centers effect Sears was really the innovators shopping centers\nThe mall the mall\nWas kind of built to revolve around Sears and they bring into the stores around them so that would be a destination\nThe mole isn't so much a destination and too many places anymore that is that is changing over the course of time as well as we go to a more online model but when you think of the things that people used to go to seniors to get it would only go to Syria is to get\nI mean there's a there's a um maybe a handful of items that fit that description but Sears used to be kind of like the one stop destination\nAs as were many department stores back in the day where you go there for clothing and you'd go there for appliances and you'd go there for um homeless services even\nAnd plenty of other things that you buy basically all under one roof now with the course of the time well here's here's an area to lawn mowers they used to sell the great ... I mean virtually indestructible\nMy old man would by law Moore's its ears and he'd eat only buy them at Sears any don't eat eat only have to buy them and we used to abuse the heck out of those lawn mowers 'cause I don't think my old man ever believed in changing the oil or or or ... or even sharp and he said as far as that goes he was pretty rough a lawn mowers\nBut he believed in that because they ran like we're courses you know it's pretty tough to get one to break down so I'm kinda curious\nI'm downtown so many crazy place you know anywhere near ... stadium in the end of the the ballpark itself in sports bars all around it all the very busy places not a good place to be unless you're going down there to\nPartake and if you have tickets good for you good for you that's going to be at least ... competition\nThe good tomorrow for us on a baseball fans will be checking out even I'll be ... between ... between the segments alright did anybody see sixty minutes did you see sixty minutes my\nGuess is if you saw sixty minutes last night the the the might be one of the last times\nYou watch sixty minutes yeah I Know\nThe mainstream media of this and that and yeah I Know CBS is liberal does like ABC and NBC\nBut the way Leslie stall what about doing your interview with President Trump was just I mean it was just beyond ridiculous come on she's basically taunting him no more and more evidence\nIn this particular segment here well I'll say the the better one let's do this one first she questioned President Trump about whether or not the White House is in chaos here you go\nIt's fake news I'm changing things around and I'm entitled to I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal they'll come into the administration there'll be phenomenal are people going to go\nYeah other people share so many people that were kind of a record of turnover I think I have a great cabin there are some people that I'm not happy with the whole you know I don't want to say that time I\nI Want to say that but I have some people that I'm not thrilled with and I have other people that I'm beyond thrilled with what about general matter we're going to leave well I don't know he hasn't told me that I didn't want her relationship with them it could be that he is I think it's sort of a Democrat if you want another trip but General Mattis is a good guy\nWe get along very well he may have I mean at some point\nEverybody lies everybody people leave\nThat's Washington ... [noise]\nShe said that there are still people in the White House that she doesn't try and you shouldn't trust I feel the same way I don't trust everybody in the White House I'll be honest with you\nWell know ... why\nWould you there's leftovers for the past administration they're serving in the White House why would you trust them wouldn't trust everybody with the FBI right now which of course why would you trust everybody with the FBI right now we know there are people that the FBI that are working against the president\nIn this whole thing about all that so many left so many like this doesn't happen with every business ration their people constantly coming and going you know it's a sacrifice to ah to take a job\nWorking for the federal government working for a any administration to a certain level it's a sacrifice a there's more money I'm sure that can be made in the private sector um it's you're under the microscope but if you're a part of the Trump Administration\nYou're getting heckled and harassed when you're just trying to go out and have dinner so what's the upside of working for the drop administration when you're gonna be harassed by people so yeah there are people you hire and you you hope they do a good job but they don't turn out to be exactly what you thought Jeff Sessions comes to mind\nI mean is Jeff Sessions working out is the attorney general\nOf the way we all hope the would the way the president hoped it would cause I've heard a lot of complaints there guys running to said yeah I'm\nI'm guessing the prices are real happy with them so that people are happy with the people you're not happy with a ... that's just a part like\nAll right now here's the one where there's just listen to Leslie stall this this is just so over the job when she talked about a Mississippi rally the president was added in him marking Dr Ford listen to this\nI was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you made that speech\nProfessor fly before I\nMade that speech we would not have one I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have\nI didn't really make fun of a well why that is the person that we're talking about didn't know the air the time the place\nProfessor ... before I got before the Senate and ... and was asked what's the worst moment and she said when the two boys laughed\nI watched him in a car and thousands of people were laughing\n[noise] they can do and say I I Will tell you the way now justice Kevin illustrated has become a big factor in the ... have you seen what's going on with the polls do you have to\nI think she was treated with respect I Know they honest like what do you think there were no you shouldn't have been thinking a tune into much prank show ya\nWhich it left it or they left it or you know this kind of a\nKind of the generation we live in ah right where nobody's feeling should be hurt nobody should ever be left to you know everything's just smooth the silk everything's fine don't bully anybody and I'm not suggesting we bully people but come on\nThe world the real world is not a perfect place and this is just part of this whole lack of coping\nMechanisms that we have so many young people particular have is they did they have been allowed to have to deal with adversity adversity happens to everybody and it happens at a variety of different times in your life all throughout your life so if you learn how to cope with it you might be a happier person by the end of the day\nAnd I think we've got time to sneak one more in here this is um Tigris yo ... parents used to be a a professional wrestler now he's a political commentator on Fox here's what he said about Kanye is meeting with President Trump\nTo be completely honest I personally didn't care I mean not good for him he got to meet the president United States and I think\nIf anything I don't know I Would say he was star struck a little bit and rightfully so like if I got a chance to meet Lou Ferrigno for the day I probably would talk the same way that kind of what he has been my hero since I was a child and I've only met him like once or twice and I forgot how to speak from when I when I saw him in the gym so political wise like it wasn't about he wasn't county was representing anybody and that's what people need it for to\nBe trying to put a lot of the only represents about can you know you didn't\nRepresent a tiny west going to meet the president United States which is usually a great honor it always has been like if I had a chance to be the president said it would be a great honor probably would have a little better prepared statement sometimes as we know sometimes we talk and we don't know how to end the sentence because we're excited yeah\nMike right now are they coming out and we just had a lot of things to get out and he was nervous there's a lot of press\nI Will finally you know given me a little bit sluggish Dave Chappelle who I think things that I'm In it by the way he's had a few issues of his own during the course of his career\nOr things that are calling you a was being a little unfairly treated All right we'll take a little tough the or break your on Cape Cod I'm nine fifty or number two is run around the corner among the things we're going to cover for you next our kind of the merging of politics in pop culture\nYou know Donald Trump came up as a pop culture figure before he became first of the United states this the way it's going to be from here on out of the future\nFor not coming up with about six ... [noise]\nYour seat from the gallery furniture made in America studios this is Casey our sci fi\n\n\nSale on shore of destruction from the ... vaccine is President Trump and the first lady now in Georgia getting a firsthand briefing on recovery efforts there from hurricane Michael after spending several hours in Florida where landfall level whole communities in the pan handle this way\nAnd he finds that to be painful I think that's ultimately what he's trying to say he sounds a little wacky saying it but you know there there are times where I've had to take a look at what the president says and you sound a little wacky sometimes the way he's trying to say something but I get are generally get with it as he means by it\nUm it just it is all getting a little surreal isn't it really is all getting surreal one day I Will say it's not boring\nI used to find politics oh so boring we or anything but board when it comes to talking about politics All right hey as long as we got ... gay what's going on in the world of Kim car dashing the wife well guess what she decides that she wants to live in real time so she won't take selfies anymore\nAnd I got\nOut about like how how much of my time I guess I kind of reaction time and they don't that um [noise]\nThink I'm not in my town and raven I\nOkay [laughter]\nShe's just all about taking selfies anymore it's that's a it's not about the southeast anymore I just want to live in real time\nOr maybe you've all live in the real world's getting out of Hollywood to live with the real world maybe maybe that would be what it would take to straighten out the ... family coming up at four twenty ... am nine fifty are coming up ... and he said SMU\nAnd he's been looking at the world of how politics and pop culture just kind of melting into one another will talk to him in depth about that coming up in the next four minutes here I came to your seat and nine fifty to forget you can check me on Jimmy bird show dot com ... dot com [noise]\nMe at work and just say Alexa placate the R C ... radio no more Jimmy beret show\n[noise] it is a force to now Iran [noise] have you ever see am nine fifty\nJimmy ... program for your drive home led you could join us here today we're a little politics and pop culture because the two have become amazingly intertwined\nYeah we've had um\nYou know pop culture south presidents I guess in the past\nBut the way they're interacting is a part of our pop culture and all the pop culture is coming to them I think has changed I mean let's face it when you've got kid rock\nAnd Kanye West of the White House at the same day that's just that's just a little bit different us to talk about it or from SMU political scientist ... just those pop culture president we've ever had\nWell it was a way certainly at a a strange day and the White House a couple of days ago when Jim Brown the former football player Kanye West\nA and kid rock world there on the same day with Kanye West Jim Jim Brown meeting in the oval office with President uh and Kanye West same debate the maestro of that old affair so it was a strange day strange mixture of politics and pop culture\nWell this is saying something when you could run for the rest of the United states speeches which is pretty much with gun you did\nWell I think to render the country so that's where it is\nTwelve or Fifteen minute rant that included are calling for a revoking the thirteenth man which created the slaves most people think that was a pretty good idea and that and then that should stay in the constitution that Kanye West I think it's a trap door that uh\nThat we can follow through and it's dangerous so it was very strange but we've had\nPresidents use pop culture figures in the past but usually it would be someone like\nYou know President Obama inviting yo yo ma or a a musician to ah to play in the White House and different\nPresidents would invite different ...\nThe musicians but but they weren't there for a [noise] they weren't there to share their political views Adam ... political utility\nChose a president but but yesterday's event where Donald Trump who's there is no stranger to pop culture having been in the New York tabloid for decades before becoming president or to invite a figure like Kanye West end and turn him loose was a very unusual\nWell even more than that Donald Trump who is reality TV star in his own right near the net a board game the Trump game I mean he doesn't get much more pop culture than that\n[noise] yeah that's right and we we've had presidents that uh that came out of the entertainment industry are and some who who knew very a\nA very well how to use the entertainment industry and John Kennedy for example was ah was great on television when that was a a new medium and Ronald Reagan of course came out of the the movie industry in Hollywood that he had quite a few other political accomplishments\nI including two terms as governor of California before he\nBecame president and and politics had become his domain more than entertainment at that point it's not clear that uh that Donald Trump isn't continuing to straddle both worlds even as he acts as president\nYeah well you mentioned Neal Ronald Reagan I mean he was very um telegenic eating a lot of work in television cameras and he knew how to ah\nTo see them play the part if you will of the ... presidential you I mean he was presidential but he knew how to protect themselves\nAnd that sort of way as to John F. Kennedy or in his ability to work the TV cameras will will probably feels like it's um it's a little different universities offering and then again the the technological times are different too I I it's hard for me to imagine a that we we would ever have a president who would who would\nSpend so much time on\nAnd a and B so sectors of it getting his message across social media\n[noise] yeah I think pets right historically some presidents\nOr we're just loved by the camera and Kennedy was one of those Reagan was another their camera added other presidents chicken tank of of a Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon ah but ah but Donald Trump isn't exactly loved by the\nCamera but the cameras drawn to him in the same way it is to tour\nA train wreck there's always something going on he commands media in a way I think that no other president has\nA and I in American history and he commands the newest media Twitter and er and other social media that law allow him to communicate multiple times a day with millions of people\nUh who uh who want to hear what he has to say so I think Donald Trump is more is the most intensive media president\nThat we've ever had in American history and and it works to his benefit but it also works as detriment because it it means that there's always an emergency there's always something that seems to have gone off the rails\nAre but nonetheless uh a lot of people hang on every work\nWell and but he's been very very protective of pointing the finger blame killed jewels in that at the mainstream media for causing him to a behave that way and and and be to have to take things into his own hands on social media\nYeah I I think that that's right he spends a great deal of time looking down the road and and seeing where things might go wrong\nOr when the economy the market's tanked or last I guess was Thursday and friday he immediately pointed the finger of blame at the fad for raising interest rates where people thought that that raising interest rates might have been\nPart of the problems that the markets saw about his trade policy was another part\nOf that problem today we saw that we've got the biggest budget deficits in the last six years but he's very much aware that he has a bully pulpit that he can use to place blame on the media for something like that that\nThat seemed to go wrong and on the fad for any economic problems and on the Democrats the unruly mob or anything or that might go wrong with him as a general getting\nThrough the Congress so he's he's very astute\nOut how to use as the media uh and even in the way that he showed dramatically over claims a for a\nA for policy victories that he might have like like the revamping of NAFTA most people on the business pages the newspapers that look at the new NAFTA arrangements call that a relatively modest tinkering with NAFTA does improve it in some regards\nUh makes it a little bit ah more expensive than other regard but he claims that the greatest trade agreement ever to have been negotiated so or ...\nOn jet spokesman are you suggesting that he's grown to exaggeration\n[laughter] I\nAm suggesting that ... exaggerate is just the half of it\nYeah there's no doubt about that here's what I Wonder though I mean is this is\nHis he set a new bar is going to be the future of politics or do you think\nBecause of it is you say we're going from\nSeems like from one crisis of the next silver manufactured simply by the way in as much of a manufactured by the mainstream media", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "city": "Houston", "day": "15"}
