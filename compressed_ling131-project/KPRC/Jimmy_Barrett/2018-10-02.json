the sixty to Chrysler Newport which um\nI told you it was ... the city teenage boy wanted to drive a car that's not purple it's light purple\nI mean it's girlie purple is what it is\nThe thing got maybe eight miles per gallon it had a huge engine it it had a push button transmission on the dash you didn't have a select shift you didn't have a ... either on the on the\nYou know an empty spot you

off the break you don't have to hit the gas that lead just good right up to twenty five miles per hour\nNow all those things were embarrassing enough for teenage boy but I think the ultimate he will

and just by west Tom Bowles got another powers or from the storm moving through so sorry about the interruption there\nBut we're back and we were talking about Brett Kavanaugh before we had to punt\n[noise] well I I don't I don't know that I'm at a lot of Americans\nAre paying nearly as much attention to this as your eyes or a lot of my other colleagues here in Washington it depends how it's presented to constituents I think in certain Senate races for example\nI think uh North Dakota where Heidi Heitkamp is running behind her Democrat or Republican challenger\nAnd this issue the Kavanaugh nomination has really resonated I think that's\nSignificant but I think in other races it probably doesn't factor in so it it depends on the race it depends on the jurisdiction it depends on how this issue and the different sides so to speak are presented to ah to constituents\nWere talking to them as giving her these days you and your on your seat above wherever the process you think they're going to be done here the next twenty four to forty eight hours and they will potentially ... upcoming weekend provided I guess of course if they know they can come up with the sixty votes

that the results of that can be communicated to other senators there's a couple of formal steps\nAre both um are ending debate in the final confirmation but you know the majority has a few different options for how to structure that so I'm Senator McConnell says that's going to happen this week I think\nWho have doubted his word in this process have been wrong consistently so [noise] um my ah if I were a betting man I Would bet that um leader McConnell is going to get it about right\nOkay um it it feels to me again like I feel like I'm looking at a in a play book here in in you know by no means I'm no Saddam was when it comes to predicting the future\nFor several weeks ago it appeared obvious once once we had the first complaint is that oh here we go here simply number one and that's not enough to slow the process will be another one and sure enough another one game and then another one came after that\nUm that ... that that is ultimately probably not going to work so I'm hearing today\nA talk you know the narrative seems to be changed you know we're kind of moving a little bit away from the uh sexual accusations and moving now into a drunkenness and in perjury\nIn other words we've got a guy who's former Yale student went to school with him who said that he lied when he said that he didn't get drunk all the time you did you think that's a possibility here that that will be the next thing they're trying to hang Britain comment on the hit\nLuckily it looks like it I think they're they they have they've had three different steps in their strategy\nInvolving three different periods of time the first step\nWas about uh the last twenty five years of his legal career and they debated the merits of that he's clearly overwhelmingly qualified\nOr and on that basis he'd be confirmed so they switched to the period of time before he became a lawyer that was ... that had to do with the accusations of sexual misconduct blah blah blah as you said no for operation\nAnd the subsequent allegations got just weirder and more bizarre and unbelievable that's not going to work so now they're focusing on the present period of time and uh that that is going to have that they are going to focus on certain things he said it is hearing a the kind of examples that you gave\nI've seen a less or by ... and some liberal website odd that claims ten different categories of lies that he told but you know you you read through I'm In a couple of them contradict themselves and on and on that goes but that's the strategy it it's big\nPieces of spaghetti that they're throwing up the wall but the what sticks and\nNone of them are going to know you don't believe any of them will no way they believe this process until after the midterms\nOh certainly not until after the midterms that's more than a month away this isn't going to be delayed and a past the first day or two of next week at most\nRealize you don't you don't consult with political campaigns at least I assume you don't ... you know if you were whispering into Mitch McConnell's ear right now about how the latest further and try to put some of this stuff to rest of the old parochial nip it in the bud what would you tell them well I\nI have always believed that the basic principles the basic\nConservative principles about the judiciary and the limited role that it's supposed to play in our overall system of government I've always believed that that is a potent and a powerful\nA position an issue for anybody who wants to do anything with it whether it's campaigns the confirmation process or the president and appointing judges\nAre and that that's where the focus has to be people have to understand the way the judiciary was designed to work they got to understand that Brett Kavanaugh is exactly that kind of judge\nAnd when that's explain to people and when that becomes the ... the focus of attention it is a powerful potent issue because it really goes to the heart of the freedom that we love in this country\nOf will I Will say one thing I I think that people have ... been paying a little bit more attention to this than than you are giving them credit for I mean the the amount of viewership\nOf people who watch those hearings was astronomical compared to normal one a lot of people who are going to our website for example was up ... percent following what was going on in this particular case I think there's been a a a great deal of interest in what's been interesting to me is to see some of the reaction from women\nEspecially women who have sons who take a look at this and they get a little scared of the idea that their child might be accused of doing something by somebody and they will be presumed guilty\nYeah I I I'm not saying that nobody's paying attention but I think even even that one example that you gave I think what people are hearing and the way that they look at it whether they think it's important\nUh which aspect of it really strikes them is really varied depending on where in the country you go who you talk to you it's not a single overwhelming message the way I think the left and Democrats want it to be and I think\nUh I think it's what you just observed I think it's actually are gonna be surprising how many of those mothers particularly are Democrats\nI think I think it's going to strike people because Democrats on the left wing show overboard and they are just overplay their hand so badly you know I think the impact that they're going to have is going to be quite different than they planned\nYou oh yeah I think they're starting

I've got to make sure I get this right in order to qualify as\nBeing sexist would've had to set it about her merely because she's a female right that would if if you will if if he's saying that she's dumb 'cause she's a woman that that would be sexist right we we agree with that so\nIf you call a reporter dumb and he didn't technically called a dumb he says you never do referring to thinking\nIs that sexist\nYou can call it a lot of things I Would say it's it's it's pretty rude I'll grant you that it's harsh it is a bombastic there's probably a whole slew of adjectives I get attached to the sexes would not be one of them\nThat term is being used by people who again are trying to divide us on gender\nThere was a real gender attempt to divide us by gender in this country\n\n... it's it's amazing you know we we'd gotten to a point where I think we had made a tremendous amount of progress about men and women being treated fairly and equally\nBy each other not not a hundred percent of the time but certainly a lot better than we'd been in a long long time\nAnd now there are those who want to turn everything into some sort of a sexual contest you'll only called me that because I'm filling the blood\nI think the reason why gets used so aggressively is because it is particularly effective\nOn certain people who don't want to be painted into a corner don't want to be called names don't want to be accused of being a sexist I mean it it's a very very effective thing to do what do you think would you put what adjective would ... with\nWhat the president called at ABC reporter

let us to really\nGive up any pretense of of privacy anymore we put our entire lives online we let everybody ... we we we photographs and video everything we do and everywhere we go so if you were to show up at the airport\nAnd you know there's there's cameras they're picking up your facing comparing it to a terrorist watch list or or somebody who is overstayed their visa you probably wouldn't think twice about it\nBut the government is wanting airlines to potentially delayed flights so that they can scan faces so the question is how close this technology are we is there anything to fear from a John ... with us future privacy forum were you at least be concerned about this John or is this is the world we live in\nI I think there's real reason to be concerned that the government isn't striking the appropriate balance and in in this circumstance there's there's no question that there are real security benefits that can come from this kind of biometric program and I think that there's no question that individuals are rightly concerned\nAbout the government potentially collecting using sharing a unique biometric identifiers for them so the trick here is to get the balance right to try to glean the benefits as as best we can and to mitigate the risks\nOkay so so maybe there's something it'd be said for um scanning for terrorists or scanning for people who have overstayed their visa for example ... coming in and out of the country because after all they are here is our guest but in order to do that you have to scan everybody don't you\n[laughter] well that's one of the real tricks to a program like this a selective\nScanning isn't going to get you a hundred percent coverage of of anybody passing through the airport\nAnd something that is comprehensive scanning I think is going to raise the hackles of a lot of folks who just want to take their flight go about their business and not submit biometric data to the government um when they you know are traveling internationally\nThey're not here on a visa or some kind of work permit or anything like that they are American citizens who you know are used to showing a driver's license and and going about their business being on their way\nWell and when you should mention driver's license the state has a some biometric information on me they have my face ...\nAnd yeah that's exactly right um and the government also maintains\nBiometric data bases involving um certain categories of individuals' right so for example convicted felons 'em and folks who've been charged with a federal crime are in biometric data base is\nThose databases though are typically subject commonsense privacy protections that restrict the way that that information is shared the way that that information is used and the period for which that information is retained\nIt also gives individual style\nAccess and a remediation writes\nIn order to try to correct errors so somebody scans your face at an airport or at a uh other sort of venue\nAnd they erroneous we identify you as me I'm both of us have the ability to challenge those determinations and make sure that the system to get it right I think one of the most troubling things about\nUm the program that the department of homeland security is is piloting is proposing here is that they're seeking exemptions from those kinds of common sense protections that\nHelp ensure accuracy and help ensure that date is only collecting used\nFor ... purposes and for reasonable periods of time\nOkay well even if we can agree under what circumstances workers collecting the data and who are going to allow to collect the data where are we going to store the data that it's going to be secure\n[noise] you know that that that's one of the toughest questions
