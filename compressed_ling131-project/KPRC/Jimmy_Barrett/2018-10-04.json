Melanie welcome to the program and um what are you thinking here as we get closer to a possible confirmation vote\nWell it looks like ... on the glide path toward confirmation Republican conference today at felt a little bit like an early picture he laughed and they're expecting half and I'm gonna get thrill and that's because the signs that we're seeing so far from Capitol Hill champion in ... as you mentioned\n... ... to ... to ... about everything there is a report and foreign partners Lincoln sat there is nothing new I'm not going to corroborate the accusation made up\nFor it so this is going to give them from hunger I could actually vote in favor of confirming half an hour\nOn and the data that issue which Republicans were initially account may have been a blessing in disguise yuppie\nYeah yeah well I I I really feel um like the uh the Democrats overplay their hand on this one they put they put up what looked to everybody even some of their fellow Democrats to be a playbook up the love of how to\nDrag their heels and to try to get this thing's stretched out until after the midterm elections and indeed was pretty obvious to just about everybody what they were doing\nI think a lot of Republicans would agree with you it's actually in many threats safer found the craft they're up for reelection away it cleaning out a lot across a lot of the great thing is that they think Democrats overplay their hand there was a late night the night from Durban protesting\nIn a letter that ... ... background check actually hot area allegations fire background checks\nI don't think that's that's a face could backfire for Democrats and no one of them are going to be here this election that Republicans will argue that women are moms and they have found and father and I think having\nA hot down here that they ... me the cabin and he has become a victim just as much a factor for it\nBut it is is he out and kept closer than Republicans and Democrats as well you know the base really excited and the weekend in a way to I think that before but I just don't think it can hurt potentially vulnerable ... phone number ... things face and\nLike a stray and elsewhere how far now I'll get out the country and I can really determine how badly\nYou know it's going to be very very interesting I think that the in any midterm election generally goes to the opposition party that's just human nature that's the way that usually works I I have a the sneaking suspicion that blue wave everybody was talking about is never going to materialize I'm not saying that they they won't lose any house seats but I don't think it's going to be enough to flip control\nYou know I think that it's not going to be a way it might be more of a\nLead tornado that touches Donny different country ever really is and I came by case basis I don't think that this is not fairly going the way that they're expecting but they certainly are going to be some states that are ... I guess the ... about how much of that but not for Democrats so\nI'm just kind of curious Melanie I don't know if you guys take any back room bets when you're covering news stories especially who story kind of Washington DC I'd be if I were you guys that will be sorely tempted to do that that's for sure what's what's the chatter behind the scenes about who was responsible for leaking duck to forge letter\nWell that's a great question that the biggest question early nine lives\nThat are in jail for evil that part is they're afraid you're kind of intercepted great story is that it was not find find a\nLink to her ... and I keep in mind the restaurant louder for not trying to find than it was a congressman and the doctor for hot in California that other people that I could see that it wasn't just fine thank you\nAnd I'm just saying there was more than one copy of it too good they might have been somebody might have been a copy of it good somebody in the end up being given it to somebody else to link\nI mean you never know that certainly could have happened and I think that the question now Republicans have and they've really been able to use that as a weapon against Democrats are saying the way they handle it with poor", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "city": "Houston", "day": "04"}
