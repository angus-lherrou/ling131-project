I don't know the point is he's a he's a journalist he's a reporter\nAnd they want to watch a diplomatic probe an ... a probe into\nWhat happened to this writer and journalist apparently he was killed inside the building that's what they theorize Saudi Arabia probably not going to allow foreigners to enter a consulate in search it and that shows a growing international pressure the kingdom is facing over the disappearance of this journalist who happens to be a writer for the Washington Post\nOkay um the Saudis have called the allegations of any involvement in his disappearance baseless they're very offended by this but they didn't have any immediate comment on Turkey's announcement of whether or not they're going to allow to somebody to go and search their entered the New York times the New York times is very vocal about their outrage over this\nHow vocal are they what other kind of vocal about it I mean they say they're upset\nBut they're still selling trips to Saudi Arabia [laughter] I Know what I just said probably sounds very ... let me just go ahead and walk you through the details here the New York times is not canceling its vacation packages to Saudi Arabia despite reports that a journalist who recently went murdered\nA recently went missing was murdered in the Saudi cancel it just kind of a big deal probably something they should care about the the the the newspaper the New York times has something called the journeys program oh the journey program it's some\nIt's diverse in international it's all it's very nice us us New York liberals just like it I don't know why my New York liberal talks like he's from the south and he's gay but I just go with it folks anyway so the New York times they they they want participants to join journalists\nAnd the editorial board members for a two week Journey Through Saudi Arabia which I'm sure it's just a lot of fun unless you're a woman who wants to drive a car and I tend to live concert\nAnd then you can't do any of that stuff while you can technically but\nYou know stone you if you do it I mean they recently legalized that in the country that's how progressive Saudi Arabia is but my understanding of this is if there's a woman that goes there and tries to drive or attend a soccer game or which they call football can you believe that but not very friendly they're not very nice gosh\n[laughter] so what does it cost to take a trip to Saudi or we will be ... with the editors of the New York times\nEleven thousand dollars a live in the dollars good lord that's a lot of money that is a lot of money\nTo travel to an oppressed nation where you're not allowed to touch anything or speak out at Turner you could be thrown in a jail cell or possibly murdered it's turkey consulate alright so for eleven thousand dollars what do you get you get airfare you get food do you get five star combinations and guided itinerary through the middle eastern nation will ... will\nGee whiz golly gee gee whiz jokers that's that's awfully nice of you in New York Times fears eleven thousand\nDollars I'm I don't see this is a waste of money at all [noise]\nApparently [laughter] if you travel there with them you're you're going to have a gosh darn great time so the trip comes in the midst of the Turkish government concluding that the Washington Post contributor and us resident the guys from America\nSo what if he writes for the Washington Post but doesn't mean it is there is to get killed by Saudi Arabians and I and I as I said his name is ... ... he was killed in late September at the Saudi consulate and it's in his Campbell in\nTurkey the U.S however is not officially confirmed if he's alive or not we don't know the latest on there so I'm just trying to give you guys the latest details here we don't officially no if he's alive or not but if you're if you're in Vegas Vegas odds I'm is\nProbably not alive I mean if somebody would take a bet on that and I do not encourage you to gamble but if somebody's taking a bad on whether or not this guy's living or dead I Would definitely go towards the latter not the prior All right so the New York times even published an editorial Monday entitled Saudi Arabia must answer for Jamal ... tickets available\nRight now to travel to Saudi Arabia with the New York times editorial board but we're just getting by what they get a jump ball but will take you to their country right now for the low low price of just eleven thousand dollars it's a beautiful nation but we're sticking\nTo think that they didn't is doing American journalists it's an attack on the press but if you want to pay us to take you to their country and we'll show you wrote it's really great time right so they editorial goes on you're not going to believe that this editorial\nThat's that's upset at Saudi Arabia for possibly allowing somebody to get murdered in their consulate you're not going to believe this folks you're not going to believe that they took time he met news story to to attack Donald Trump\n[laughter] you can't even write the stuff as if Donald\nTrump is in charge of the nation of Saudi Arabia or had anything to do with it well they're saying that he has a close and coddled relationship with Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed\nHave you people never heard of President Obama have you already have you've never seen the photos of him\nBowing down to Saudi Arabian royalty you're not remember when that happened all yeah Donald Trump went there and dance did he do the sword dance or something that oh yeah dancing that's not dancing what we have a problem bowing down to Saudi royalty that's fine let's just showing respect but dancing saying\nBy the way for the low low price of just eleven thousand dollars you can travel all the way to Saudi Arabia with the editors of the New York times and if you're if you're lucky they might even take a selfie with you that's how great it is you know it's it's really super you know for just\nFor sure they murder to one of our journal is one of our friends in American but hey\nForget about that that doesn't matter what no it's fine Donald trumps the problem here and for eleven thousand dollars you could travel with us to Saudi Arabia\nWhere we will bad mouth President Trump I'm Ken Webster junior you've been listening to pursuit of happiness radio here me twice a day early in the morning before ... Johnson and right now one month on listening post download the podcast and keep your radio dot com\nBeing the person\nIs really a\nYour when you\nBefore with queen that people it was always my parents' dream for me to go to college at the other day one of my biggest regret that I never finished I'm sure they would have treated any of my walk down the red carpet to any walking a cat and get\nMy mom always told me education is to kill a mocking your dream to kind of believe stray or has an each and every student I'm not saying it's going to be easy and that's what makes every class every damn all the hard work\nFrom the gallery furniture mated America's\nYour seed to seed\n\nAccusations and gas lines so many ... as the Florida Panhandle prepares for a direct hit from hurricane Michaels\nIs your last chance to get paid for this monstrous and deadly storm boxes\nThey do in the red Sox up more and therefore I I'd rather have the home field advantage that extra game at home although I think about it we're about the best road team in baseball maybe I shouldn't maybe I should wish for that maybe we'd be better off being on the road\nSo that's my heroes number one I guess there was a strong word should use the term hero positive sports story\nIs the Astros at least for us there was another positive sports story last night he was in the national football\nLeague in Doug ya ya I Know I Know I Know I Know I Know I Know I I'm not I'm Still not happy about\nThat whole anthem debacle thing too about happy with the stance delete took an unhappy with the stand some of the players took and ah I'm Still not happy about it but but I'm not an unforgiving us there'll be I'm just as there'll be I forget them I just don't forget\nSo you know they're on super duper probation with me right now which means I'll watch some football goes lord knows I Love me some football but it also means that you know you're one step away\nYou are one step away for having me too and you all to get in by the way I still I still all my biking\nTeachers all by Nike shirts some of my best teacher to Ninety teachers they're all sitting in my closet I've not born a Nike logo things since that whole column cabinet commercial came down\nSo here's my question should I bus stop the Nike again if I'm\nReady I'm willing to forgive the national football league and give them a chance should I also forgive Nike and give them a chance\nMan I'll tell you don't have a lot of golf clubs that are thinking it's a tough one\nIt's a tough one I'm doing all selfish on this one in one of the reasons why I guess I can feel little selfish little motivated little for giving you if you will is because there was a great moment last night\nOn Monday Night football it was a great moment I didn't even realize that the saints quarterback Drew Brees was so close to breaking them to fill all time passing record went into the game last night in third place\nUm I think he's maybe a hundred yards behind Brent Barbee was in second and a couple of hundred yards behind all time passing leader Peyton Manning\nLast night he was lightning up he was light it up and he broke the record in the first step in case you haven't forgiven they got a bill in case you haven't heard here is the moment as captured for the broadcast last night of Drew Brees becoming the all time pass leader\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nOnly one way to describe it you know it was a great moment it was great mother because the uh the guy from the national football league hall of fame in Kent, Ohio is there you see him he was wearing white gloves it's football\nEverybody's had their hands all over it for almost the entire first half of the game they they weren't up\nWhether they used it in the game I don't know so what if your fingerprints on there there's probably thirty other says the fingerprints on the football but that you know\nHe's he's taken the football and he's going to take it to Canton, Ohio where it's going to go into the national football league wall of fame and Drew Brees beautiful wife is there and is equally adorable children are there and they're all having a family hogging the ball but did the whole thing comes to a stop and\nThe players are all congratulating him it was nice to see something that positive\nAgain especially when you're talking about this guy he spent virtually his entire professional career in New Orleans you know and what is ... ... basically media market I'm sure he could have gone free agent\nI'm sure he probably could have made a lot more money blamed for somebody else that he does for the New Orleans saints although my guess is he's making pretty good money we don't need to feel sorry for Drew Brees based Russian imagination but this guy he's the all time NFL passing leader in in from\nAll reports and all around good nice decent human being he's not he doesn't worry about making big news he's a Family Guy you know he's got the boys you got a daughter now you just you know he's a Family Guy that was played football for a living he's humble he praises other people for his success\nThat kind of an athlete we used to be able to look up to\nWho doesn't he's not interested in being political done interested he he knows what his job is\nHis job is to throw the dog on football in our job is to watch him do the football so congratulations to Drew Brees that was a nice moment last night\nI may have found the craziest girlfriend on the planet\nBut I'll let you be the judge of that\nHer and her twenty two rules for her boyfriend coming up next year in

forget to the crazy girlfriend story\nI Want to talk to you folks about a company called bill advisor\nThey do several things that are kind of interesting uh they negotiate bills on your way out the ones who have recording bills each and every month and by the way this kind of how they started\nAnd then they figured out that one of the big bills that there were very successful in negotiating lower was home insurance then they thought you know we can do even better\nIf we do our own homeowner's insurance we can give our customers great coverage and saved them even more money so here's how this works and here's how you find out how much they can save you you text the word save as they be either ... either twenty three twenty three twenty three\nA bill text you back asking for your home address it's a matter of public record don't need to go all conspiracy theory about this\nYou just you your your home as a matter of public record it it has been since the day you bought it and before that from the people who bought a before\nIt'll tell them how many square peach you have you know the brick or frame construction yeah that's all singles are tiled roofs all those types of things that go into determining what the replacement cost of your home would be of heaven forbid as you burned to the ground\nOnce they have that information it's amazing how quickly they can go through it\nUm and then takes you back with a very very good quote\nNow but it's so good you want to try them than what they also could do for you as they can get all your old policy issue whatever refund you're due in Institute the new policy without having to lift the finger divide on how much what he could save save the word I should say text the word save SAD\nThat save as they be eaten twenty three twenty three twenty three or go to bill advisor dot com alright\nThere's a part of me the wonders if this is a legitimate story or not you know sure sure and I were talking about this on ... this morning between five and eight she thinks she thinks it's a it's a bogus story 'cause she doesn't believe that anybody would act this way\nBut I've seen people act this way\nSo I'm not so sure it's a bogus story here supposedly what happen some guy bought another guy's used car he bought a used car in the car when he's going through and cleaning up the car he pulled this list of twenty\nThe other thing that is driving me a little silly are crazy about politics\nIs how it seems like we have more and more members of city council who think that they should be making state law Austin, Texas our state capitals one of those places where the city council has adopted a law requiring employers these are these are not employers with\nWho are providing goods and services to the city Boston these are private employers requiring them\nRequiring them to pay sick leave to employees or they can't\nOperate within the city Boston so we'll get into that a little bit they're fighting this one in court will get into this a little bit with a ...\nHe is with the center for America and the future of the sexes public policy foundation see what the court fight is all about how evil is going to turn out when you talk to him about five minutes here and Casey RC nine fifty am [noise]\nAnd I saw the envoys list\nPrice dealer price took me happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms like\nBlack or what they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not anymore and tell you about your price from ... car except price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying\nRemember thinking mom had

more about the deal you get a view or keep your sea listeners just as nobody will to other people because you know these websites usually goes you know Bell's knows more\nBut not this time not this time it'll you by the way people took out some of the word check out a Jimmy bird show dot com or that's where we screen the program alive right now and um you know you get a little fuel for some of the work that they do All right it's been interesting to watch this is happening all around the country in cities all around the country\nWhere city council members\nEvidently aspire to greater things they they don't want to just make laws that impact\nThe citizens of the city you know they don't want just\nBuild roads or run schools and schools now they want to get involved and you know private sector issues like a paid sick leave for example um up until the last year\nWe've had no state law governing this particular aspect released whatever state laws we do have you're in Texas are geared more towards the employers um however\nThere are two major cities in Texas now wants to in San Antonio the past sick leave ordinances Austin's ordinance was scheduled to go into effect on top of the first was in Antonio following up next year but there's been a court order temporary\nBlock of of this particular piece\nOf legislation that is going through wants to have been going through San Antonio in there are state legislators are talking about taking action on this is will\nJoin us to talk about it is right Walters he's at the center for American futures of Texas Public policy phone they should do the one suing to block the orders in Austin welcome to the program Ryan ... who would be covered under this ordinance as far as providing paid sick leave that doesn't provide enough\nWell Jimmy it's a great to be with you or the the Austin ordinance that is the subject of this lawsuit\nA applies to any employer regardless of whether they are actually headquartered in Austin or not that has any employee who works at least eighty hours a year\nOr within Austin and obviously eighty hours is is not a huge amount that you know two two weeks a full time work so um\nYou would be covered that required to to follow the mandate of the ... and stuff for any employees who would satisfy that over a year or eight hours a year\nAnd if the you know just to see people as you said ... any any company that does business in Austin would have to follow this rule correct that's right now I'm guessing you're ... you're talking about covering people like ah waiters and waitresses resemble of restaurants\nRight any employ any any employees wouldn't be covered ah ah the ... if you have at least Fifteen employees over a course of a year you have to provide at least a eight eight days of a paid sick leave sixty four hours a year or for any any business\nOr below that threshold or you have to provide at least forty eight hours or six days a year\nOkay so we're we're we're not even talking necessarily about part time people here we're just we're talking about people early but deadly working as you said a few weeks out of the year I'm\nUnder any normal circumstances is there any other company on on its own that's providing that type of benefit I'm due to a to a part time employees work so few hours\nWell I I I'm not aware of it um and you know one of the the main problems with laws like this is that it it mandate\nCertain benefits you know it's sort of one size fits all\nWhereas you know different employers and different sets of employees have their own different priorities so you know some some even a temp agencies a staffing agency is that we represent for example they provide even their their temporary workers who are you know very intermittent or with a six paid holidays a year which you know they're not required\nTo do but ah by you know all in the dollars that dollar to an employer so uh by mandating this certain benefits it would require you know accessing other certain benefits that that employers might provide their employees may may value more than ...\nI'm sure you do a little research on this run ... which which industries would be the most by one and it's like this well\nI'm you know we represent a broad cross section of of business in the ... the Texas Association of business the national federation of Independent Business which is mostly small businesses\nAnd or the American staffing association which is a temp agency staffing agency and to be honest with you that the staffing is are particularly hard hit\nBy these types of ways as um as far as I I can see most organizations like this around the country actually except temp agencies whereas the Austin or didn't explicitly says temp agencies are covered by this or that\nAnd just by the nature of what temp agencies do you know providing to employers a worker for a day or a short period of time because they already have an employee who was out sick or you know otherwise in disposed to working so a fiber wiring the temp workers\nTo to be able to take off paid sick time the fire staffing agency to to essentially paid twice\nA week in those circumstances when someone takes paid sick leave because they still have to provide that worker to their their client the the the business trying to get a temp workers so\nThat it just that given the way that stacked against these operate in what their whole purposes or it's just in can grow and that that these sorts of mandates would apply at all to those type of business\nWho who's been lobbying uh the city of Austin um for for these types of rules changes is this something that some social justice warriors come up with on their own or is there something bigger behind them as\nWell as you can imagine the public employee unions are\nBig funders through the workers defense project which is that a group operating throughout the country I'm pushing things like this ah they've been the main um impetus behind\nOrdinance is like this you know then it gets it's considered a big deal to them that you know this is that an Austin was the first orders of this\nType in the state of Texas and indeed and the entire south\nSo that the unions are trying to get a a foot hold in a in the taxes you know a right to work state and you know this this ordinance and Austin for example it\nIt actually you know it discriminates in favor of unionized employers so it encourages employers to unionize by\nGranting them a special exemption from uh allowing them to modify that the annual cap on the amount of hours that they provided employees so that you can see this is a way that they're trying to encourage unionization in a right to work state like Texas\nYeah well and I'm sure Texas is a target because we are right to work state and then I'm sure every right to work state is for these folks that's right All right so um [noise] the other part of it I think that particularly bothers me\nA you're not going to open up with this a little bit ... news um you know we're talking about city council members their job is to take care of the local schools take care of the\nRoad needs provide city services and figure out how to pay for those their job is not to go into the private sector employers tell them what it is that they have to do to run their business that's outside of the state law\nThat that's right Jenny I mean the the Texas ... as you know and it's been\nA miracle in in this country on job creation people are moving from all across the country to come here and\n... you know one of the main reasons is that we have such a a business friendly climate that's why employers are moving here from other states that's why workers are coming here because of the opportunities here so it it's very strange to some of the cities here in Texas won it you know kill the the goose that lay the golden egg\nAh along with Virginia kind of back and forth and best states for business neither neither one of us for the very top of the list anymore and I think it's because of actions like this where we're even city government wants to get involved in unnecessary regulations\nRight that's right yeah we've seen a lot of that in ... I mean on a statewide level it seems that you know Texas is doing what\nTo do but we have you know major cities in in the state that just seemed to be on it\nYou know sitting in front of a different page or in a song book and you know we've we've seen the Texas Supreme Court for example I start to to push back on some of these you know where you have a state statute that that says\n... can't do this this is something on a statewide level like we saw with the the plastic bag ban or that the case that came out recently where cities had banned grocery stores are giving a plastic bags to their customers and now that was those were those the expert witnesses were overturned and you know we have a state statute here the Texas minimum wage act\nWhich is one of the bases where he is and to to challenge these ordinances that that says municipalities\nCannot set a make any changes to the\nMinimum wage set by federal and state law that that is that the level and they can't go beyond that and yet and\nThose standards say that you only have to pay people for for when they actually work for hours they actually work with the paid sick leave I wanted to say you know you actually have to pay them the equivalent of minimum wage for for hours you're not working\nSo ... we already had an order the legislatures already acted and said we're going to set the state level to have a uniform and he so that we have a single market in Texas we have a single state wide market\nAnd we're not we're not going to have this differentiation within the state uh where people can't compete\nAcross the boundaries so\nThey've already I I Know the legislature when it comes back into session they might ah act in a more in a broader way to sort of preempt more what these yes but you know the alleys are doing but our argument is that they've already done it the Texas minimum wage at at least as regards to ah he's\nPaid sick leave or Texas I'm guessing you've argued more than your fair amount of cases in court the state law always Trump local oh\nWell it depends I mean generally intact home\nRule cities like the city law in San Antonio they are free to act with the same sort of authority as the state itself would have to act but the legislature always had the power to say well in this area\nWe're going to stop alleys from acting in in order to have a state wide standards so the state generally and the baseline to cities can act with a pretty broad a in a ... ... across a broad range of activities that you have a lot of\nPower initially but the legislature if if if the if the city conflicts with the law passed by the state legislature that the state law trumps it\nOkay All right so maybe the state legislatures going to have to come up with something more specific to address these types of ordinances or else this is probably I could see something like this happening in the city of Houston as important\n[noise] right so we're we're hoping that our law suit or you know when when with regard to the city of Austin's ordinance will set a precedent that uh will apply throughout the state uh with regard to these paid sick leave or and it says but the\nLegislature when it comes in um well you know have an opportunity to look more broadly about what cities are doing what are you know what\nThey're allowed to do in in regulating businesses and the like but with regard to the paid sick leave or just as we believe they've already acted and we're hoping that this shows that uh uh that's the cities are already acting illegally uh\nBrian thanks for joining me today good to hear from you sir best of luck in court huh\nIt's been great to be with Jimmy ...\nYou've been running Walters he's with the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation here

Winston Churchill wasn't racist he was a racist\nSo so all all of a sudden Scott goes running back all I didn't I didn't I didn't know that he'd done these people wrong\nI I I guess I guess I I'm Sorry I Apologize is that all the Churchill lovers started to band up and and knock him down for for not defending Winston Churchill is just to make\nThe other example of the partisan divide in ... in the case of Winston Churchill this is not Nineteen fifty three this is about Nineteen forty five this is not the late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds when the man was was\nAround viewpoints have changed a little bit\nBut when I come back from the break here I Am sure quick little clip with you of a of a a historian who was on Fox or talking about this very issue with Tucker Carlson he has he has a deeper idea what's behind this it's not just the partisan divide\nIt's about changing the future by changing or eliminating the past\nAnd in a lot of ways what he says about it makes a whole lot of sense so we'll have that story coming up also Republican strategist Jessica cologne for those of us who've been watching endless political commercials as we\nGet closer to the midterms especially here in Texas man oh man does that make sense you know on the back to back to back to back splitting those commercials 'cause that's what we end up seeing we'll talk about that coming up had about a four thirty three zero in case he RC we'll be back and just a moment ... show dot com [noise]\n\nYou\nListen to Jimmy at work [noise] just say Alexa placate the R C ... radio now more Jimmy beret show\n[noise] for thirty to our time here on Cape years they were going to give our guest is just sick of it as you want to finish the salt that we're having about [noise] a changing history [noise]\nUm there was a historian I'm a sucker Carlson last night and uh they got into a very interesting conversation I thought about um you know how America has never been that great remember governor Andrew Cuomo made that remark\nAmerica's never been that great that um you know we have so much in our history to be ashamed up and to apologize for\nSo they got to this conversation take a listen to this is the end of this conversation about what the motivation might be behind all this\nWhile the trend is to a halt the American narrative\nAt to make us all feel ashamed to be Americans to look at every aspect of the American story and say you know the founders were bad the constitution is racist and what better place to start with Christopher Columbus Israeli patient zero of the European invasion of America\nWhat is it I couldn't agree with you more that's clearly the threat that ties all these stories together trying to the origin of the country with him but what's the point is that why would they want to do that\nWell I think the point of it is if we feel bad about our country if we feel bad about the past\nThan they can rewrite any kind of future they want the progressive monitoring the United states into a socialist country while in order to do that if you say that you know the founders of all evil man and an evil document and everything in the past with bad well then they can come up with a future that sense whatever they want to make right\nYeah it's it's a really good point that debate I thought for thirty three now\nYou're on Cape you see Jimmy ...

I. C. czar is someone who lost her age I as the election\nAnd he hired her to be his educations are which we should not have any way okay the city's just does not even educations are that's not our job at the city of Houston we are paying taxpayer money into a trying to be to have\nOur education is one central location not to have the city take on that responsibility but the person who heads up that job as someone who lost her school board elections settled\nLet that sink in for a second I'm\nAnd to see how liberals and progress as our you know uh and has historically you know for the last couple of generations infiltrated our education system and that's why we had this very conversation we just had about revisionist history in our classrooms in our textbooks\nThe are the only person in Houston that I don't mind using terms ours is Michael berry\nThat's right you can be as our dog goes all as old as ours we need it as though\nWe only named ones are not marrying that's all right\nAll right well let's let's you know these are the kinds of things I think one of the reasons why it's good to be talking about these things these are the kinds of things that eventually hopefully fire rub voters\nAre more Bolden political ads themselves easily issues things if it's it's the things we see going on in Washington DC and the best everybody I Know who's in your line of work just as the loan and that is\nWhat's gonna happen with these midterms I mean it's good to be the way that people are talking about is it gave me the reverse of that because of what happened to break out at all or is it just gives you a typical midterm election\n[noise] this is not a typical midterm election uh first and foremost um and you know it's getting to be a cliche but we're finding that each election as\nIs as important as the one before it um we hear all the time that's most important election on your lifetime Sean Hannity said last night just the most important midterm election of your lifetime will twenty China after Obamacare is pretty important too and that was the birth of the Tea Party movement you know in every election that we have seen really I'm\nIn the last\nTwenty years has been missing critical\nTo uh somewhere and you know one agenda or another and we have seen with the liberals have done to this country but I said this when Obama was president and I and I is becoming turned out that as quickly as Obama Tong things are round on us and\nOn their head President Trump has come in and tried to whiplash it back into shape and we have seen how quickly markets can react how quickly a culture can react how quickly are older can react when someone stand up\nFor what they believe in it doesn't back down and like it or not we saw that President Obama and certainly we like it here but I seen it with President Trump and that\nIs a real asset of what happened in this Kavanaugh hearing confirmation and swearing in situation we saw president did not back down\nFrom his tech from his nominee and by him doing that it gave an enormous amount of cover and an enormous amount of um [noise]", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "09"}
