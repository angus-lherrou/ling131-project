located off six ten in between the mosque and sales bacon and boring I'm young I\nMean yes there you go well there you have folks\nI ah I read an article earlier publisher gave you ever see radio dot com talking about some sketchy voters shenanigans happening in Houston, Texas there is actually a UPS Store yeah some time at UPS not UPS PS or whatever and not the United States Postal service or or FedEx but ... who who by the way if I'd actually gone on the topic\nUh recently decided to cut ties with the in our interest and that's why I and if you're thinking to yourself I won't use FedEx anymore I'll use the UPS Store well here's a little bombshell about the UPS Store there's the UPS or on west ... eighty eight people registered to vote there you know in the little post office box as they have a problem with that\nYou can't register to vote in a district where you don't live and also\nIt's kind of screws up the the the pool for jury duty if you if you ...\nIf somebody for jury duty and they show up and they serve on the jury and they don't live in that district and they're not supposed to be in that part of the city or that part of the state the whole case gets thrown out\nNow that's a pretty crappy reason for a rapist or a murderer or a serious criminal\nTo to get their case dismissed that's a horrible reason for that to happen right I Would think even I Would think even liberals and progressives would agree with that you shouldn't be registering to vote in places where you don't leave I wondered if anybody had heard about this\nAnd some people are calling in so I hey Brian in Santa Fe have you heard about what I just said and did that have anything to do with why you're calling I just saw the description up on the screen you're about when you know\nI I'm I'm a new ads on and tell you about last up later on but I'll\nTell you that on friday okay friday we'll do a lot of stuff that's fair\nI um I was a travel for a living as you know and I asked them to be going through the silver or she says her [laughter]\nWhere are you right now what is best okay what is that noise I'm curious that was made tremendous amount of the the phone screwed up\nOh drive a truck right of course yeah I knew I we've talked before I Know who does as\nI I get for them so I always invite people to eat lunch with me when I watch the local sheriff was missed southern Georgia town okay and I was shut down and he starts telling me about the only one little Johnny has the weather's like\nWater more people voting than there actually people in the town but there is rampant amount of people getting um Boulder we called her trip paper ballot shut their mailbox is when did it requested ...\nRight yeah that sort of thing has happened in Texas as well and in fact non citizens were getting stuff in the mail it was a it was a voter registration card and it was already filled out for him it just said sign here and send it back congratulations you can vote I\nAlmost feel like that's entrapment because you have a you know you can bet that everybody that gets one of those things in the mail probably wasn't planning\nOn committed voter fraud I met a few people thought oh I didn't know I could I'm not a citizen I\nI could vote while I met might as well try even if I'm not supposed to I bet there's a handful of people do they got it and just didn't know the lawn thought oh is this what I'm supposed to do OK and now that person could get arrested or deported or or or worst spend time in prison and well and that's the stuff the Democrats\nDo Brian right well the share of what he's really worried about his border we're walking into a world can no longer um their social person running for governor is also the secretary of state\nWhich is the person that apply right you know does the voting yeah right exactly like\n... already stolen or people yes to cash out because this thing is so so it's like anything he was going to be the\nDemocrats are taking the call yeah you know like we may not know who the governor of Georgia will be maybe a year from\nYeah that that the Democrat that women that's running isn't is probably not going to win it's a real costs raise but I don't think she's going to win I'm not I I really have mixed feelings about this you know I'm I like it uh I like an America that is for everybody I'm not\nYou know this isn't the ultra right talk show I Love the idea of a state somewhere having their first black female governor but I don't like her policies and and it's also curious to think she never really been a black female governor anywhere that's a bit surprising isn't it\nThe weird thing is is her the announcement for her you know or or or a campaign ads that come on the radio there are only talking about is let's make the first black female governor that or not it has to do not this is our to fix this none of thing just bail us out of the first black female governor\nYeah interesting right she got Brian ... got Stacey Abrams that's her name and ah if if that's all your policy position is is like hey ah my genitals in my skin color like\nI Can't really get behind that and and we've seen this happen before you remember from two thousand eight to twenty sixteen uh that that narrative definitely weren't paying my skin color every body of my skin color wow was\nThis guy's a Democrat who acts like a more a war monger Neal town and he wants socialized medicine but but hey he's black we'd better vote for him right I I I think that we're just I think that we're just\nMaybe maybe six to eight years away from starting to see black conservatives do a lot like what\nColin Powell dead you know nobody people were so surprised by that well now that's just become part for the course of course there's a black\nRepublican on the Supreme Court why can't there'll be a black Republican president or a black or or a black female a governor of the state you know that would be awesome um earlier this week we were talking about how much we can do so in in this whole ... thing on the show and I don't know if you guys have heard the latest on that but it's\nPlugs that is still happening but ... are now having like a raft did you hear about that Brian\nYeah I heard about that I I I just look at it and he's trying to make sure he's make cells right he's maybe on issues or somebody trying to get back the black popularity\nOr something can is Kanye West is trying to say that he was used I think ... was used tiny west got on Twitter about what was that two three months ago I was a while back weeks ago and he said I like to weigh Canada so instincts and that was kind of how we'd have we'd seen some hints of this before that he was but he was a you\nKnow dabbling into conservative or ... or libertarianism or whatever it is he he thinks that he is we saw on Twitter over a year ago he said you know there is no freedom without monetary freedom well that sounds like something Milton Friedman would say and I remember\nFor a long time picking county had jackass political policies and then when I heard that he treated that out I taught awesome maybe counties not so stupid massive time times have changed\nA little bit of time has passed I'm suddenly we now find that Tonya west of trying to ... distance himself for people on the right I think he sees the writing on the on the wall he knows

service I Do not serve candy too high schoolers\nIt's too old our producer Chris little solving off the air that um you know somebody that was trick or treating until they were Eighteen Eighteen years old trick or treating\nI Know we have a lot of a young people who are no hurry to grow up and to grab a adult responsibilities but I mean shouldn't somebody tell them you're too old for that I Would

even if it's candy and of course candies\nThe hallmark of Halloween you know what I don't really know I guess I should look at the history on this uh maybe I'll do that during the break at the bottom of the hour here and look up the story on this but where did the whole passing out candy on Halloween start\n\nDid that starts a I remember when I was a kid in addition to candy or people used to put out healthy alternative\nLike fruit apples was a big deal and then they remember they had the the razor blade scares\nOf and I don't think it was ever as bad as people thought it was but then people were afraid to get apples because they're afraid the razor blades in the apples then we went through the big scare of a ...\nPeople putting pins and things and candy bars and again same thing I don't think it was ever as bad as as the media reports\nOn that it was but um\nThat's that's when I ... that's one trick or treating change that's that's what we had so so many fewer kids out\nAnd and now parents are kind of stuck with the idea that you could only go to a couple of houses and you have to know the people whom you're getting the candy from or something horrible is going to happen to your child so this this being a our first Halloween in this house I'm going to be curious to see how many kids would get\nRio Texas real talk continues now quickly surely beret show\nTV or fifty\nYears on the shores on him not just because you're so you are shows the Rocky Mountain view in dot com [noise] um [noise] more and then coming up here and just a few minutes but I I Do want to um [noise] this is this is going\nDown the strange road here I'm One of our listeners Robert ah just sent me a message on Facebook you said look up the candy man look up the candy man it's a good story for Halloween as Houston based you ever heard the candy man\nHis name was deemed coral he was once the deadliest serial killer in American history\nDean coral\nDo everybody around them seemed like an ordinary person enjoyed spending time at the small candy factories mother owned in an affluent neighborhood in Houston I'm not sure where in Houston was\nHe got along with many of the boys came by just to see the candy come off the assembly line he served in the army during the Vietnam War never had a criminal record neighbors described him as quiet well mannered groomed pleasant consider it always smiling\nBehind the smile though he had held a deadly secret between December Thirteen\nNineteen Seventy in July twenty fifth Nineteen Seventy three a total of twenty eight boys ranging in age from Thirteen to twenty disappeared from the heights neighborhood all used in the heights five miles west of downtown Houston\nThey were all tortured and killed by dean coral\nWhich at the time of the most prolific serial killer in American history what makes it even scarier issue recruited to teenagers as accomplices one was Seventy year old marine handling the other was Eighteen year old David Brooks they do many corals victims personally\nA few of the boys with their friends ultimately without the affections of the accomplices no one would have ever known what happened to the lost boys of Houston Heights the accomplices however revealed all including curls disturbing methods\nEvidently they use ... muscle car or his white van to lower their victims one by one over the span of two and a half years a use candy alcohol or the promise of going to a party to get each teenager\nInside anyone who's gone to the ... car never came back the candy man from Houston, Texas I had no idea that's the scary\nPart of history ha ha now my producer Chris little was telling me a story off the air above butter finger which by the way is my personal favorite is a get out like Clark Bar but the butter finger at the clock bar pretty much the same\nSo here's what I'm here's what I was told\nOr what was it says on online about the invention of the butter finger and how it's God's name\nButter finger was invented by the critics candy company Chicago Illinois and Nineteen twenty three when the company held a public contest to choose the name of the candy the name as a slang term to describe it clumsy person often in sporting events described an athlete who can't hold on to the ball\nAs an early publicity sudden marketing ploy the company dropped butter finger and baby were candy bars from airplanes in cities across America which help increase his popularity so it's named after somebody who can hang on to do something better finger\nUm a lot of people by the way baby route candy bar a lot of people thought it was named after Babe Ruth in fact it was not it was named after president rubber Cleveland's daughter Ruth who was a baby baby Ruth\nI'm [laughter]\nThat that's what they think anyway some of these things we don't have a definitive answer\nAll right back to my uh my candy when it got imbedded and who invented\nAnd all that good stuff what your gun imbedded in again I'm I'm I'm I'm kinda curious here do you have a limit on trick or treating in your house if you've ever turn anybody away because they're too doggone old seven one three to five nine fifty\nYou'd want to join that conversation candy necklaces you remember Kenny was this I don't know if any but gives us how they were first introduced in Nineteen fifty eight\nThe thing about candy necklaces is they never came wrapped\nSo they never really struck me as being the most high Jenike\nType of candy you know somebody's fingers are always all over Nineteen sixty lemon heads\nUsing the same formula

sixty seven the original flavors were strawberry lemon orange and lime Nineteen sixty two was the invention of that one later\nDebbie candies were created Nineteen sixty two given the name based on the idea that you could enjoy some now in save some for later now later\nBut uh\nAs I recall as a child if you open up the pack you're probably going through the whole thing Nineteen sixty three sweet tarts\nI don't think they're as popular as they used to be sweet tarts were big thing at one point in time\nUm they've been favored now for over forty years ah Nineteen sixty six the hundred grand bar formerly known as the one hundred thousand dollar bar they were named after a popular game show the sixties and so they got their name a C.\nOr Nineteen sixty six is when wrestles first came

the middle and you've got the you know the the hard shoulder lollipop around it\nUm stickers much bar came out in Nineteen Seventy\nOr they used to be ... much now it's just so much I I don't know
