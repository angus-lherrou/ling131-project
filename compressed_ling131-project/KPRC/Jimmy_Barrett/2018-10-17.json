[noise]\nShe said there are still people in the White House ... ... you should trust I feel the same way I don't trust everybody in the White House I'll be honest with you\nWell know ...\nWhy would you there's leftovers from the past administration they're serving in the White House why would you trust them wouldn't trust everybody with the FBI right now which of course why would you trust everybody with the FBI right now we know there are people that the FBI that are working against the president\nIn this whole thing about all that so many left so many like this doesn't happen with every business ration their people constantly coming and going you know it's a sacrifice to ah to take a job\nWorking for the federal government working for a any administration to a certain level it's a sacrifice a there's more money I'm sure that can be made in the private sector\nUm it's you're under the microscope and if you're a part of the Trump Administration you're getting heckled and harassed when you're just trying to go out and have dinner so what's the upside of working for the drop administration when you're gonna be harassed by people\nSo yeah there are people you hire and you you hope they do a good job but they don't turn out to be exactly what you thought Jeff Sessions comes to mind I mean is Jeff Sessions\nWorking out is the attorney general of the way we all hope the would the way the president hoped it would cause I've heard a lot of complaints there guys running this ad yeah I'm I'm guessing the prices are real happy with them\nSo that people are happy with the people you're not happy with a ... that's just a part of life All right now here's the one where this is just listen to Leslie stall this would this is just so over the top when she talked about a Mississippi rally the president was added in him marking Dr Ford deck and listen to this\nI was just saying she seemed to know anything you know any of that speech we would\nFly before I can

treated has become a big factor\nIn the ... have you seen what's going on with the polls but did you have to\nI think she was treated with greater respect and all the other side what do you think we shouldn't have been you'd think you train it was quite as I said earlier\nWhich is laughter they left it or you know this kind of a you know the generation we live in a red were nobody's really should be hurt nobody should ever be left to you know everything's just smooth the silk everything's fine\nDon't bully anybody you know I'm not suggesting we bully people but come on\nThe world the real world is not a perfect place and this is just part of\nThis whole lack of coping\nMechanisms that we have so many young people particular habits they did they ever been allowed to to deal with adversity adversity happens to everybody and it happens at a variety of different times in your life all throughout your life so if you learn how to cope with it you might be a happier person by the end of the day\nAnd I think we've got to understand one more year this is um Tigris yo drivers is that was used to be a professional wrestler now he's a political commentator a box here's what he said about ... meeting with President Trump\nTo be completely honest I personally didn't care for him he got to meet the president United States and I think\nIf anything I don't know I Would say he was star struck a little bit and rightfully so like if I got a chance to meet new friends you know for the day I probably would talk the same way that China whether he's been my hero since I was a child that I've only met him like once or twice and I forgot how to speak from when I when I saw him in the gym so political why it wasn't about he wasn't county was representing anybody and that's what people need it for too\nBut he tried to put a lot of the only represents about can you know you didn't\nRepresent a county where it's going to meet the president United States which is usually a great honor\nIt always has been like if I had a chance to be the president said it would be a great honor are probably would have a little better prepared statement man [laughter] sometimes as we know sometimes we talk and we don't know how to end the sentence because they were excited yeah\nLike right now [laughter] situation where they are now we just had a lot of things to get out and he was

all that good stuff and of course you're always welcome to join the show if you want to make a phone call and I'm old\nBefore we move along or do you want to remind you about bill advisor in this great homeowner's insurance policies that they're now selling ... here's what they found out the little ... started talking about bill advisors the company that will negotiate with other companies to lower your monthly bills your cell phone bill\nI'm your energy bills those kinds of things and one of the areas they found out that they could really say people a lot of money I mean a ton of money is in homeowner's insurance and I think of how rarely used your homeowner's insurance\nI mean you want a good policy you want to deal with the company that is going to make sure that they are there for you if you haven't forbid you have to use your policy\nI mean I've owned a home probably for Thirty years and I've used my homeowner's policy once and only time I really cared about was at one time I really needed it or the rest of the time I was just plain bunny ... in and out in a in you know never getting any use of it\nBut the folks that I'm a bill advisor\nCan save your money out of the homeowner's insurance and it's really really simple to find out how much you don't even have to talk to a person in order to be able to make that happen what you do is you text the word save SAD eat to twenty three twenty three twenty three\nLet's say if it's a the twenty three twenty three twenty three little text you back asking for your home address is a matter of public record do big deal or they just need to see how many square feet you have and that kind of construction your home is is a board is it is it stuck goes brick\nOr do you have a swimming pool what are some of the of the things they need to know in order to determine what kind of insurance you need and then within seconds they'll send you back a quote\nWell based on what are you said about the president and meeting with the president\nAnd how he conducts themselves and how he's refusing to count down to the idea of not worrying is make America great again hats are all these other things he's liberal friends want him to do he's refusing to go along with it\nAnd he finds that to be painful I think that's ultimately what he's trying to say he sounds a little wacky saying it but you know there there are times where I've had to take a look at what the president says and he sounds a little wacky sometimes the way he's trying to say something but I get are generally get with it as he means by it\nUm it's just it\nIs all getting a little surreal isn't it really is all getting surreal one day I Will say it's not boring I used to find politics oh so boring we or anything but board when it comes to talking about politics All right hey as long as we got ... what's going on in the world with Kim car dash and the wife\nWell guess what she decides that she wants to live in real time so she won't take selfies anymore\n[laughter] any more\n... like how how my cat my time I kind of reaction time and I don't\nThink I'm not in my town\nOkay [laughter]\nShe just all about taking selfies anymore it's that's a it's not about to sell these anymore I just want to live in real time oh you want to live in the real world getting out of Hollywood\nDeliver the real world maybe maybe that would be what it would take to straighten out the ... family coming up at four twenty ... am nine fifty are coming up ... and he's in SMU\nAnd he's been looking at the world of how politics and pop culture just kind of melting into one another will talk to him in depth about that going up in the next formula zero in case you see in the lead over again you can check me on Jimmy ... dot com ... dot com [noise]\nGo to listen to me at work [noise] just say oh look so bleak KP RC all now hard radio no more Jimmy beret show\nIt is a more than you know you run [noise] have you ever see am nice if the Jimmy ...\nDrive home led you to join us here today we're a little politics and pop culture because\nThe two have become amazingly intertwined\nNow we've had um you know pop culture south presidents I guess in the past\nBut the way they're interacting is a part of our pop culture and all the pop culture is coming to them I think has changed I mean let's face it when you got kid rock\nAnd Kanye West of the White House at the same day that's just that's just a little bit different us to talk about it or from SMU political scientists Cal ... is this the most pop culture president we've ever had\nWell it was a way certainly at a a strange day and the White House or a couple of days ago when Jim Brown the former football player Kanye West a and\nKid rock were all there on the same day with Kanye West in Jim Brown meeting in the oval office with the president a and Kanye West same debate the maestro of that old affair so it was a strange day is strange mixture of politics and pop culture\nWell this is saying something when you could run through the ... of the United states specious which is pretty much with gun you did\nWell I think the rent or the the whole country space so that's where it is\nTwelve or Fifteen minute rant that included a\nCalling for ah revoking the thirteenth man which prayed their slaves most people think that was a pretty good idea that amendment should stay in the constitution that Kanye West side thinks it's a trap door that uh that we can follow through and it's dangerous so it was very strange but we've had\nPresidents use pop culture figures in the past but usually it would be someone like\nYou know President Obama inviting yo yo ma that\nThey are the musicians to ah to play in the White House and\nDifferent presidents would invite different kinds of musicians but but they weren't there for a they weren't there to share their political views add a fair political utility to the president but but yesterday's event where Donald Trump who's there is no stranger to pop culture\nHaving been in the New York tabloid for decades before becoming president or to invite a figure like Kanye West and then turn him loose was very unusual\nWell even more than that Donald Trump was reality TV star in his own right there the net a board game the Trump game I mean he doesn't get much more pop culture than that\nYeah that's right and we we've had presidents that uh that came out of the entertainment industry are and some who who knew very a a very well how to use the entertainment industry and John Kennedy\nFor example was a was great on television when that was a a new medium and Ronald Reagan of course came out of the the movie industry in Hollywood that he had quite a few other political accomplishments\nI including two terms as governor of California before he became presidents and and politics has become\nHis domain more that entertainment at that point it's not clear that ah that Donald Trump isn't continuing to straddle both worlds even as he acts as president\nYeah but you mentioned the Ronald Reagan I mean he was very um telegenic you knew how to work in television cameras and he knew how to a\n... to ... play the part if you will of the ... presidential like I mean he was presidential but he knew how to project himself\nAnd that sort of way as to John F. Kennedy or in his ability to work the TV cameras will will probably feels like it's um it's a little different universities offering and then again there's the technological times are different too I I it's hard for me to imagine a that we we would ever have a president who would who would\nSpend so much time on\nAnd a and B so effective it getting his message across on social media [noise]\nYeah I think pets right historically some presidents\nOr we're just loved by the camera and Kennedy was one of those Reagan was another their camera added other president she can think\nOf a Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon ... uh but uh but Donald Trump isn't exactly loved by their camera but the cameras drawn to him and the same way it is to\nTo a train wreck there's always something going on he commands media in a way I think that no other president has\nEr and er in American history and he commands the newest media Twitter and uh\nAnd other social media that allow him to communicate multiple times a day with millions of people uh who uh who want to hear what he has to say so I think Donald Trump is more is the most intensive media president\nThat we've ever had in American history and and it works to his benefit but it also works is detriment because that it means that there's always an emergency there's always something that seems to have gone off the rails\nAre but nonetheless are a lot of people hang on every work\nWell but he's been very effective it pointing the finger of blame killed jewels in that at the mainstream media for causing him to a behave that way and and and be to have to take things into his own hands on social media\nYeah I I think that that's right he spends a great deal of time looking down the road and and seeing where things might go wrong\nOr when the economy the market's tanked or last I guess was Thursday and friday he immediately pointed the finger of blame at the fad for raising interest rates where people thought that that raising interest rates might have been part of the problem that the market", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
