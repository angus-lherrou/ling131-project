Donald Trump his heads in the right place but I don't think what he's doing is going to help Donald Trump knows that these people are asylum seekers they're refugees they're looking for either\nRefugee status or amnesty status thing legally those are technically two different things but there are seeking asylum and\nThere's laws in place that says they can do this part of the reason why you don't see any coverage of the story that says\nIllegal immigrants stormed the gates of Guatemala and Mexico now it's not it's not the case for that to be true they would have to be illegal immigrants they're not they're just migrants illegal implies that they were previously deported and they snuck over the border some of them might be illegal immigrants but the vast majority of them\nAre legitimately asylum seekers so Donald Trump's plan to have an executive order to change\nThe birthright citizenship legal loopholes essentially anchor babies it's not going to do anything it couldn't I mean after all they're not in America most of 'em aren't even pregnant so that whole anchor baby thing isn't going to do it's not going to do squat until they already get over the border\nAnd then and then they're ripe with fetus assuming you know the women I don't want to see him anybody's gender maybe the mental get pregnant to hey just because they're men doesn't mean they don't ever uterus is right that that's the world we live in now I had a strange time\nAnyway members of the migrant Caribbean earlier this week rejected an offer\nFrom the Mexican president Enrique Enrique Pena Nieto\nTo settle in Mexico if they truly were asylum seekers there should be there'd be no case after they said we they fit the story would be over right if they were really legitimately asylum seekers thousands of these migrants migrants within the group opted instead to continue their track\nTowards the United states that's despite defense secretary Jim Mattis saying that they're sending troops there by the way I saw an interesting number earlier you're probably wondering how many troops are being sent to the border while we spent two thousand to Syria\nSo how many are being sent to our border five thousand twice as many as we sent to Syria Syria remarkable isn't it of course most of our strategy in Syria was for us to arm\nMilitants who later on turned out to be ice says I don't know if you guys remember that I mean what we did in Syria was just a mess it was it was a complete mess although I Am grateful that eventually they did manage to to clean up the deal or but it's still going on a this isn't a segment about Syria but you know you don't hear about these things much after the\nThe controversy over them Peters out and then you wonder well if Syria all all ah all clean and in ... and nice again\nNow it's really not it's still basically a crap all you wouldn't you know don't plan a vacation I guess is what I'm saying but for the most part most of the ISIS fighters that we're in places like Iraq Syria Libya they flew down to Central Africa so they still exist\nUm people have\nCriticized Enrique Pena Nieto for taking money from the cartels and I think that is a good reason to criticize him he won't be the president for much longer they just had an election in Mexico a so I think he's finishing out his term righty goes away at the end of this year\nThe new president is something of a socialist Enrique Pena Nieto is just like a corrupt liberal by Mexico standards\nUm but took money directly from the cartels and also the cartels murdered journalist what news story does that remind you of well it should remind you of Jim ... the Saudi Arabia and American journalist who was murdered by the Saudi Arabian government at the Saudi consul into in a in Istanbul, Turkey\nThis is this is strikingly similar to that what happens in Mexico is very similar to what happens in the Mid East people want to pretend like it's different\nBecause the cartels a criminal record the cartel donated money to pen to Enrique Pena Nieto and if you don't think that those two things run parallel to each other I'd say you're just not paying attention anyway

know you're\nOn the ... of all the legal experts are running forward do\nThe do the\nSo maybe we need to get a second opinion about whether we can go and um how do we go about interpreting the forties the members of your constitution seems pretty civil rights seems pretty simple because we know the history of working from\nHome but wild years the American civil war and reconstruction bold ... rock liberation of the thirteenth ... granted formal\nFreedom to the slaves in a bowl of slavery\nWas a way to try to guarantee the W. drug is a ... chip away that's the kind of how we began but it's as we know\nOrdered much more broadly them up in these words swear word that's a word or just literally ... you're going to falls was goes for a living is always fun trying to ... constitutional law but that's why we have a Supreme Court right\nWell that's right and unfortunately the Supreme Court has not\nA really spoken on this issue since the late Eighteen hundreds and so we've had about a hundred plus years now of of really what has been ... executive agency assumption as to what the Supreme Court decisions mean but the reality is it's actually very unclear\nAt the Supreme Court has not ruled on\nA lot of these specific issues and so we're left to kind of fill in the blanks um and this has actually been in an academic discussion amongst\nVarious scholars for especially the the last thirty forty years as to what the citizenship clause actually means\nOne was interesting to me but I think most most people if you if you were lucky enough to find somebody who knows with the war to the members of the constitution is that they're basically\nThe good was the either the anchor baby above it all persons born or naturalized in the U.S is subject to his jurisdiction are citizens the United states if you're lucky they know that part of it was actually bugged section two or three of them um\n[noise] well that's right a though it's it's not always necessary to get into to all five of those I mean it it is important\nTo remember that the fourteenth amendment was one of three different amendments that we're focused as you noted primarily on a reconstruction after the civil war and and ensuring that the newly freed slaves were afforded their\nTheir rights and we're not being a essentially held under a slavery in just a different format\nUm but it is the really important part here is\nAs you note that the text of that citizenship citizenship clause\nThere are two factors associated with citizenship\nThe first is that the person be born in the United states and the second is that they be subject to the jurisdiction there up and so the real question is what does it mean to be subject to the jurisdiction of the United states what did the people who drafted\nA frame to ratify this amendment intend with that and so that is really where\nThe crux of the discussion is\nThose the into this to cover everybody I mean what what ... I don't think they did they\nKnow I mean they couldn't\nForesee what was going to happen to the stores immigration I guess\nRight what what to a certain extent you're right at the time it was ratified there really was no concept of illegal\nImmigration because there were not laws restricting or prohibiting immigration so effectively at all immigrants were legal and so what you have to look at it is what were they intending to do with this where they intended to exclude certain individuals and under what circumstances and so when you look back\nThrough and both the context that so they were trying to constitutional lies a statute that they had passed a previously it with the same Congress and the same year ah and so what did that statute mean\nAnd then also what did they stay in their debates and when we look at these two things that it's fairly clear that the Congress that was passing this amendment was ratified\nThis amendment had a very specific understanding of what it meant to be subject to the jurisdiction there up and in fact they thought that it meant subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United states in a sense of pulling this full\nSet of allegiance uh now what does that mean it means that they did not think individuals who were subject to foreign powers or to a tribal relations such a Native Americans living on Indian reservations that individuals who are only temporarily president in the country\nThat those individuals were not subject to a complete jurisdiction they they were subject to a limited jurisdiction clearly they had to follow American laws they can be punished for breaking American laws up but they were not a\nFully allegiance under the complete jurisdiction of the United states\nOr at least not in any sense that\nThe newly freed slaves who were lawfully present or even against their well but they were lawfully present at they did not owe allegiance to a foreign power or and so it was really trying to deal with them specifically well excluding individuals who didn't fit that category\nAiming at what other times his before to come up for debate in the ... what are some of the pieces and questions that people who are both the fourteenth amendment was of course it's a\nShirt so there are really two Supreme Court cases that dealt with this issue specifically I'm\nThe first was a case called asks me Wilkins in the early Eighteen nineties and not dealt with a Native American who had been born on an Indian reservation with tribal ties uh he grows up as an adult he leaves the reservation ah\nLives in ... in you know cities and in the United states or fiction and he goes to vote and he says I'm In the United states citizen\nI'm no longer subject to your tribal authority and the government says no you you're not a citizen\nSo the Supreme it goes to the Supreme Court and in this case called el the Wilkins the Supreme Court says no this individual is not a United States citizen under the fourteenth amendment and the reason for that is that when he was born he was born subject\nOr at least in part to tribal forty he did not complete allegiance to the United states that it was divided in many respects\nBetween tribal authority which was considered at the time it caused a foreign power a ... and so it's it's the sense in which he was not\nCompletely subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and he couldn't make himself subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S by by simply leaving the tribe that that was something that happened at birth\nOr the second case is a few years later and Eighteen Ninety eight it\nAs the United states be Wong Kim ark and this is a case that most legal arguments for universal birthright citizenship or will point too\nSo that's dealt with an individual who has the U.S born child of Chinese foreign nationals who are legally president ... sorry legally presence and and permanently residing in the United states and they'd been in the U.S for twenty or Thirty years\nThis adult child leaves to visit China he tries to come back the U.S denies him re entry saying we're not accepting immigrants and the guy says well hold on\nIf we ever had if we ever had the one executive orders jumping to supersede the interpretation of a constitutional amendment before\nI went to in in many respects this is not superseding anything there there is no actual interpretation of\nThis amendment from Congress so the statutes dealing with immigration and citizenship from Congress simply restate the words of the fourteenth amendment it does not explainer clarify them and the Supreme Court ah other than it's limited holding in one Kim our pets not\nClarified its interpretation or application to two factors outside of those decided and want Kim Clarke\nI and so in many respects this has just been something that has\nBeen done through executive feel the executive agencies have decided ah for various reasons to to act as as though that was the scope of won won Kim arc that all individuals born in the United states will be treated as citizens will be given passports and Social Security numbers\nOr so and in many respects this was an executive interpretation and\nAnd it is well within the scope of the executive office to to say look we have this other good faith interpretation or we think this is the correct interpretation there's nothing to the contrary and and this is how we are going to show to execute the was according to his interpretation\nOkay so we are or what but what ends up happening it'd be issues with executive orders Udall going from the federal judge somewhere who say that what the president's unconstitutional it'll work its way through the system and when we go we would end up before the United States Supreme court should they decided to hear the case\n[noise] yeah yeah I mean it would probably go the same way that we've seen a lot of the other executive orders go with his\nPresidency especially the so called uh immigration ban a ... almost immediately I'm I'm sure you would see ... the exact specifics of those lawsuits are going to depend again on the specifics of what the executive order does I almost certainly\nOne of them out of the plethora of the ones that are sure to be filed you'll probably have a judge somewhere issue an injunction um my guess is such an executive order a would never go into effect prior to being seeing an\nInterview by the Supreme Court again we saw this with with some of the other immigration orders a and ultimately this is going to be something that are almost certainly the Supreme Court is going to have to take up and take on this issue for the first time in Iowa hundred and Twenty years at this point\nA to do maybe is it may be part of this is a burden that we've certainly seen this week with President Trump before of forcing people to take action and if you if you've been in Congress into a corner you're going to force them to take action on this issue which they voted taken action on for twenty Thirty years ago\nWell that that's right and even just today Senator Lindsey Graham ah issued a statement saying that he was going to look at uh\nIntroducing a bill there there have been bills introduced in various Congress it in the past looking to clarify the issue\nAnd none of them have gotten much traction especially not recently um but this has been something that at least certain congressmen\nHave have realized like this is up to to Congress Congress has a good chance to to clarify\nThe scope of of the amendment that at least yeah issue or a\nSome sort of a statute clarifying it and it it hasn't done that in and frankly it hasn't been an issue in in the past at least not in the sense that a previous executive a previous previous president has has tried to change the status quo um by saying no this is our different good faith interpretation of of what this means\nUm so it it has already spurred Congress or at least certain congressmen to action and\nIt certainly going to be something that will continue to be talked about\nSay the president's very good at that his name [laughter] here really is quite quite tell that when it comes to getting other people's skin but but at the end of the day it's amazing how things get done\nIt's amazing how things get done All right well I Would guess due to the president probably feeling fairly confident with the new make up the United States Supreme court that the the big push comes to shove he's likely to win\nYeah and again you know I Can't speculate as to\nTell where court might fall on that just because we don't actually have an order and try to buy a what I Can't say that that that has been an academic debate in in the background for quite some time now there are legitimate argument for a scholarship for for looking at it from an original standpoint saying like\nThe way that we are interpreting at that citizenship clause now is inconsistent with how Congress intended for it when it would pass on as ratified what Congress intended\nFor it to me in a that there is simply no\nConstitutional mandate for universal birthright citizenship a and that it can be at least in in this regard limited to something more consistent with what was intended by the rat ... at the ratifying Congress\nOkay Amy so much appreciation for you taking all this time to kind of explain all this to us appreciate it very much thank you\nNot a problem thanks for having me\nFrom the Heritage Foundation that's a nice word joining us Iran and the the ...\nThis is just an observation for me because I've always kind of thought to myself as a history gate but I learned a lot\nIn the time that we talk\nTo her she strikes me as being just you strike you as being kind of really smart history nerd like she\nShe would she would be the kind of woman that when I was in high school I even as much as I liked it paid attention to his right I Would have sat behind during class just so I could you got to look over his shoulder when she's writing an essay or something maybe get some\nGood ideas I don't think I'd go full of cheat also going to have to full of cheat but ah she'd make a good study buddy I'll tell you that All right\nI I think that um that that is a much more I Hope you don't mind that's much more in depth explanation on something that is just going to be especially the mainstream media is just going to be sensational headlines you know what's going to be sensational headlines that's and that's all it's going to be\nAnd we know already it's going to create a lot of anger is going to ... Grillo charges of racism and all sorts of other things as to why the president is proposing\nThat um we no longer just rubber stamp any child born in the United states that there is legal precedent for what the fourteenth amendment says versus the reason why it was created and it's a little bit more complicated than most people\nWould have you believe in fact it's probably a lot more complicated than most people would have you believe All right um we'll move on to other things you do next hour you're on Cape Cod of nine fifty did you hear the forecasts for Halloween by the way this has done looking good\nThis this after buying a huge supply of full sized candy bars to make my first big impression on this neighborhood and it looks like a rain out is kind of\nMore of that story plus did you hear there's a there's a there's a town in North Carolina that is banned the candy\nYeah Winston Salem North Carolina no center point seven points with his wife want high point of sort of just what they make over for the band is sort of kind of candy for that story coming up we'll let before your ... your seat Jimmy ...
