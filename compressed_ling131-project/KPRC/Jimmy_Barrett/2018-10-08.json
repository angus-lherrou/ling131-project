{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Raised from the history books you're doing the Ku Klux Klan of the early twentieth century a favor because that's exactly what they wanted to Christopher Columbus is a man who was once a hero to those targeted by the most racist people in our country who also happened to be Democrats\nNow he's being targeted by antifa vandals and progressive politicians as they attempt to take down a statue all over America ironically it's hard for so called progressive Z to understand the basic question from our past if we erase history\nAre doomed to repeat it\nWhich by the way it's supposed to be the opposite of progress to call themselves progressive left just too busy honoring alleged child molesters like Marie are murderers like iodine or no notice their own shortcomings I did I say so much for progress man\nThey don't have new ideas that's the reason why all they can do is fight back against Kavanaugh there's nothing progressive about progressive is um it's not a new idea socialism has been around for centuries in fact talking about Christopher Columbus well\nThe earliest American settlers the pilgrims briefly tried to experiment\nWith a with a with a political and economic system not unlike communism socialism in which everyone shares and get all gets along guess how it worked out\nHere that toilet flushing yeah that's the blue wave but in this sense it's also the idea of socialism failing the earliest American settlers didn't work for them at all they ended up using capitalism you know why because capitalism works and it's awesome\nSometimes the leftist has silly ideas\nAnd their ideas are often misguided and confused and inspired by things from real life but it may seem to make sense at the time but never actually do when they come out and [laughter] and our practice in this little thing we call reality\nAlright so shifted focus here on that note taking that into consideration all their silly ideas I stumbled across the news story earlier and it gave me a silly idea if I was a progressive this is how I Would read a news story like this\nI'd read this news story and I would come up with an idea that is economically sounded ecologically friendly and absolutely misguided and ridiculous money explains\nI'd like to you all the travel with me real quick to Louisville, Kentucky where police are searching for to Kentucky jail inmates face scape late Saturday evening\nBy hiding in a trash can yes it's true folks public transit a favor recycling and using mass transit on all the things the progressive love and\nLiving in a government institution progressive love these things and breaking the law that's also something good progress a blob it actually\nHappened about ten o'clock on Saturday Night Justin somewhere and Jeremy Hunter scape from Louisville metro corrections by\nHiding in the food waste trash cans that were then taken outside of the facility for disposal according to a statement from the jail [laughter] so a witness saw the man escaped any notified a corrections officer but not in time for them to not get away\nYou know you can only imagine what was going on in the jail that day some guy was like hey there's\nSome guys are going to skip I better tell the I better tell the prison guard\nIn about Fifteen minutes [laughter] you know in a way I'm sure he wanted the or he wanted to do the right thing by reporting the missing but he also didn't want to help the guards right isn't that isn't that the uh you know the the rules of the road when you're living in jail I guess and anyway so both of these\nGuys similar in hunt they were working in the jail kitchen so I guess you see how you got access to the garbage a metric corrections said the men were both minimum security inmates arrest warrants have been issued for them\nAs a Sunday Morning neither of them have been found and the last I checked I don't it's it's Monday now I don't think they've been found yet either Jefferson town police arrested somewhere on August twenty seventh because of charges of motor vehicle ... so he stole a gun and he was a felon in possession of a of a of a handgun no he's still a Carney out of hand gun\nAnd he also had ... felony drug possession of drug paraphernalia so probably like a pipe or something we'd\nI don't know anyway so here's my ideal I told you guys just gave me an idea I think like progressive you hear a news story like this and you fix yourself okay\nThe prison inmates living in a state correctional institution and they traveled outside of the prison in a garbage can well\nThat sounds like it's affordable low cost ecological you sound it involves mass transit that's all the things progress it was a lot of there's probably an idea and missed somewhere they just haven't quite put their finger on it yet [noise]\nHey commuters argue sick of sitting in traffic for hours on end while you try to get to work I share and what other choice do I have things to to inmates from the Louisville metro corrections Institute now you can get to and from work faster than ever\nHad with the Kentucky rapid dressed transit system rapid trashed transit how does that work it's easy public threats receptive goals are located all over our city while many people use them to dispose of trash most people probably don't even realize you can hit you're riding them to cut\nYou short can just climbing side and wait until your friendly neighborhood trash man comes by to pick up the garbage\nTrash man excuse me that's not gender include says no part in us we met trashed person said either that or but how long to wait for our trash version is near I\nJust didn't take long at all just wait a few short hours while sitting in a pile of garbage and you'll be there in Kentucky rapid dress transit system is just as affordable as it is eco friendly\n... well that sounds great I just sitting in a pile of garbage thanks government\nYour welcome this message paid for by the Kentucky rapid dress transit system banks government such a beautiful idea\nYes in in the progressive dystopian future we all ride to work inside of a garbage truck because that's the way the government is oh okay I guess I'm just being ridiculous but hey speaking of ridiculous how many have you saw this photo over the weekend that ... this viral photo that surfaced on line\nThat said do not warm urine is a picture of a microwave at uh Jacksonville gas station and apparently they're located right near to drug testing clinics now some of you're probably wondering why would they want to why would you want to go in there and microwave urine well they need to get the urine to be body temperature\nBefore they can be drug tested so I guess these poor people this family of Indian people that own are Pakistani or whatever they are\nHad so many junkies coming in their microwaving their urine but they had to put up a sign you think you've got problems now\nIt's a strange time strange times we're living in folks anyway I'm Ken Webster junior for the last hour here I've been ... just like I Am every afternoon\nAt two PM I Love when you guys call me

going to be a bachelor of forever or but she got married over the weekend her feet\nSaves a screenwriter hang a screenwriter screenwriter like Hollywood type\nHuh really\nYou think he's he's a liberal or or do you think he's a conservative\nOr is he may be somewhere in between the sort of apolitical maybe I don't know I don't know evidently it was a just a real small intimate Feroli twenty family members were there it was held at the Bush family compound it can live on Fort main their backyard overlooking the ocean\nDescribed as a very short sleep ceremony or father walked down the aisle\nHer grandfather George W. Bush Ninety four ripe old years of age was there her twin sister genna Bush agar served as the matrix of honor her daughter's Margaret poppy with the flow of girls along with the grooves nice\nA puppy did double duty at the ceremony also serving as the ring bearer the bribes and Dorothy door oh Bush um officiated the ceremony there you go oldest daughter's going she's married off\nSeeing that women one of my favorite topics some of my favorite people are women [laughter] and my wife is a woman last time I checked [noise] All right\nYou know I\nSpent a lot more time I don't think I've ever spent as much time talking about a Supreme Court nomination\nThen I spent talking about Brett Kavanaugh and that's pretty obvious reasons I mean it's it's just amazing what happened to him what happened to his family I mean that's yesterday's news I mean over the over the weekend\nYou know you've got to give you got to get Republicans credit I even have to get Mitch McConnell credit and I'm not a Mitch McConnell fan you know there are times that it just doesn't feel like he's the kind of person who's getting anything done\nAnd there are times where I feel he's way way way too interested in just getting along\nGetting all trying to get along with the Democrats you know the the Republican establishment is spent forever just trying to get along with the Democrats were just trying to get along we're just trying to get something bipartisan going they have no interest in working with you\nThe Democrats have no interest in working with Republicans in any way shape or form there are only interested in power they're not really interested in making any sort of compromise\nAnd and I think the bread cabinet case really takes that to the extreme\nBut as you know one of the things they basically he was burnt capital of it'd be it'd be it's just the way he treats women abusive to women are sexually abusive to women verbally abusive to women just abusive to win you know writer and waste and by the way having him on the Supreme Court is going to be one of the worst things that could ever happened a woman\nA woman or women\nWell did you hear what he's already done and I don't know I guess I wasn't even aware that he made this is one of his promises but evidently um Supreme Court justice bread capital sounds likes to say that doesn't it\nHas fulfilled one of his promises after weeks of contentious hearings the Senate voted to confirm him Saturday evening Kevin an already on the job Sunday Morning with the court's first ever all women team of law clerks\nEvery single one of his clerks is a woman he is the only one of the United States Supreme court that\nHas ever done that the women are Kim Jackson Shannon gravel may get lazy and Sarah nominates and reason why I mention their names\nIs because some day they may very well be on the Supreme Court themselves it's amazing how many people who clerked for Supreme Court justices later went on to become either a big time federal judge or in some cases the Supreme Court judge themselves may Brett Kavanaugh is one of those guys and there's plenty of others like him\n[noise] I'm\nTrying to remember um who was that he clerked for that came to the top of my head doesn't really matter that much anyway you may remember that during all these proceedings their Democratic senators said he would provide the court\nWith the ability to roll back roe v Wade\nAnd there's been no indication to me that he's going to do that um he tried to counter those concerns Kavanaugh did at the first round the confirmation hearings saying that no federal judges said more women law clerks to clerk at the Supreme Court than I have also said he get for female walkers ready to work for them on a moment's notice this through\nFirst justice and Supreme Court has to do that um\nBy the way one of them came jak symbol become one of the three\nBlack law clerks working at the Supreme Court's so she is not only female but she's also African American she has previously worked for capital along with one or the other black lurks ordeal the Washington Post or said he reports for work tomorrow\nWith a case about crimes involving firearms so he gets right to work and I'm here here's my only concern\nAs releases about having gone through um I'm I'm I'm ecstatic that's gone through I think he was the perfect choice for the job I think he'll be an amazing Supreme Court justice or at least they have a whole lot better than some of the alternatives we could have had\nIt I think he'll do fine job my only concern is that it happened over this weekend versus maybe two weekends from now\nBecause I really thought we'd have some more shenanigans I really thought we'd have some more delays going as far as the votes I really I really was quite honestly surprised that we got to vote in the United States Senate I'm Brett Kavanaugh this past weekend\nI really thought something would pop up they would call because the whole thing can be delayed and to be honest with you the the fact that they didn't concerns me a little bit because with a twenty four seven news cycle he will have ascendancy to forget okay well see everything's fine\nBreakout La Guardia and I've got nothing to worry about here I'm I'm worried about us missing out on some motivation\nThat the longer this drug before we actually got\nTo the midterms the more inclined we would have been maybe two specifically remember it\nWhen it came time to vote\nIn November the other concern I have is because the Republicans were successful in ramming the whole Brett Kavanaugh things through\nAnd were successful in defeating the Democrats on this that they will be able to whip up their base into a frenzy that you know get them all upset not that they weren't upset already but get them even more upset\nAnd before you know here we've got ourselves a situation where\nMore of them are showing up to vote then then the Republicans are showing up to vote so that is a little bit of a concern\nUm but\nI'm I'm going to hope and I've gone to think\nAnd I'm going to guess that between now and election day something else will show up on the radar\nSomething else will show up that will just remind everybody that if the Democrats do get control of the house that\nToo which I Would have to say what were the other sixty five percent of Americans watch or fifty five percent fifty five percent what what what were they watching that they didn't think it was by is twenty percent actually thought that the news coverage was biased in his favor\nNow that's shocking to me because I'm assuming that the ones that thought it was by his behavior are watching CNN or NBC or ABC or one of those other networks they're not watching Fox News I can see if you are watching Fox News and you're on the other side which is a pretty rare occurrence\nThan you might think it was biased in his in his favor\nOr Fox News might have been a little bit by the newspaper but just like we are biased in his favor one of the reasons why we're so biased in this favors because the rest of the media is so biased against him you know what I'm saying these are small\nWay of trying to level the playing field is a little bit here\nIt shows you according to pollsters Democrat all this is that a democratic pollster her name as Molly Murphy a partner at AOL gee research\nSaid people don't trust the media very much I think they tend to think that there is bias this is from a Democrat [laughter] I'm surprised she's willing to admit to this\nNo we don't trust the media very much too weak and there's a good reason for that\n'cause they're not very trustworthy most of the time\nThe good news is I think most of us who got the circuit a long long time ago\nBy the way\nDid you hear the president is going to take a victory lap\nOn bread Kavanaugh he will\nCeremony is least wearing and the Supreme Court justice at a prime time of that in the east or in the White House that's going on tonight\nIn a room full of reporters television cameras and Republican lawmakers at seven pm tonight eastern time the president will be standing next to Brett Kavanaugh it will present him to the nation is one of the chronic achievements of his first two years in office\n\nHe did not by the way give the same treatment to justice Neil Gorsuch but there's you know his confirmation process was pretty easy\nHe swore Gorsuch in Lebanon o'clock in the morning ceremony in the rose garden but this is going to be prime time this is going to be a little bit in your face now\nPersonally I'd never been a huge fan of confrontational politics but the other side has made me more of a fan of it and then I'll tell you why\nIn one of the reasons why I think that this is actually may be good for the Republican Party I think the Republican Party is starting to grow a set\nAnd I think you know what I mean by that\nBefore they didn't Mitch McConnell mainstream Republicans the Jeff Flake of the world by the way going way way way or the way to avoid confrontation you know taking taking a lot more than than than they should take\nIn an effort trying not to rock the boat don't give us labeled as being sexist or racist or or whatever it is they're going to label you anyway\nBut we conduct themselves the thing that Donald Trump has done that seems to be having now would impact on the Republican Party is he's he's always fought back no matter how hard anybody has made it for him he's always fought back\nAnd now Republicans are starting to see the fighting back might actually be good for them fighting back might actually be good fighting back may demonstrate to the people who would like to support you that you're willing to fight for your beliefs\nAnd you have to because other sides going to keep on fighting house minority leader Nancy Pelosi saying this week the Democratic lawmakers need to focus on the terms she said we must not agonize we must organized people must votes\nBy people she needs anybody pretty sure she was just in his early need you to be in August the good the citizen\nOr in order to vote you just want you to vote 'em she sent an open letter out yesterday to her fellow Democrats she said to achieve this we must own October with are for the people agenda which I Hope you will advance intervention on social media in the weeks ahead\nHang on they have a for the people agenda what what\nWhat is in the for the people agenda because I have not heard Democrats other than some of the socialist who are members of the Democratic party I have not heard them articulate\nAny real ideas if you live you buy miss something is there a is there an agenda at work here that that doesn't involve just putting down the other side is there ... or their actual policies that they're talking about here\nShe said basically I think what she's trying to tell her fellow Democrats and maybe maybe she realizes with all of us are feeling that I continue to harbor the breakup of the things that they're just they're not helping themselves\nHe said the ... decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has wounded the very soul of justice in our country\nAmid our heartbreak however we were new our resolve and determination what's at stake in this election is nothing less than the health of the financial security for families across America this is why we must by even harder to win fight even harder to win\nSo that we can achieve in advance are for the people agenda\nWhat a stake in this election is nothing less than the health and financial security for families across America\nDon't you think our financial security is probably better than it's been and lord knows how long unemployment rate of three point seven percent historical lows for minorities when it comes to\nEmployment I mean it plummeted historical high unemployment is at the store circle lows ... what even black teenagers the rate still crazy high to me like the point three percent is crazy high but these are all of historical lows how much\nBetter do we think we can get and what in the world\nOr the Democrats are offering up his programs that would make those things better me what they're what they're talking about what they always talk about our higher taxes and more government programs\nAnd I don't think I don't think that's what we need in order to be able to achieve the next level can unemployment rate go even lower I think it probably can\nThere are a lot of jobs out there that we just have the right people trained for those jobs could be filled so yes there are even more employment opportunities and there's the labor force continues to be stretched more and more people are going to make money that's how that works that's a supply and demand that's how that works\nSo hey they've got an agenda I'd love to hear it other than\nYou know trying to obstruct everything the president was just I haven't seen any other program others but how would you like to be a guy by the name of goods hockey whose whose name happens to be Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat do you think his life has been likely leave
