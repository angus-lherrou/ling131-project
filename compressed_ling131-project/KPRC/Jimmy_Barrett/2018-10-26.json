I'm ... I'm great it's it's been takes Martin do you uh do you think Michael having that he would take the deal\nWith what\nDo you think Michael have an idea would want to represent this guy I mean it will be complicity but on the other I don't\nBelieve in your town Stormy Daniels indicator stripper\nI mean it makes sense actually because think about the catering stripper separate let's say if you think about it though this\nGuy actually well it might seem unlikely for Michael have an eighty to represent this guy actually if you pick out a little it does make sense because Michael having that he likes to represent people who make Republicans look bad and isn't it doesn't this guy make Republicans look bad\nAnd it broke right now a lot of trouble it back in front of the ...\nRight exactly ever since Michael I have an idiot turns out he's in debt millions of dollars he owes hundreds of thousands more to the IRS yeah Michael Evan energy needs the catering stripper maybe we can make a connection Kmart and you want to go see less lonely boys the most Lobos\nNot I'm not much into that but I tell you what you want to hear quick joke I Would love to yes what's the difference between inlaws and outlaws what is the difference outlaws or want it [laughter]\nI like my mother in law but I still like that joke hey speaking of jokes would you like to go to deport all the portrayals comedy tour\nOr not I'm good I'm Out here in the middle of nowhere\nMartin nothing wrong with that you know you ought to do go get some southern star beer from southern started Brewing Company a great place\n... thanks for the call Myrna appreciates what ship over here to Austin Austin is calling from Richmond Austin how are you sir\nI'm doing well thanks for taking my call time what's up\nNo first on the cutting disrespected that you didn't know how far ... boys but\nThat's [laughter] to my defense in my defense back when they were both really popular a lotta people pointed out that kind of weird they kind of sound alike and they have a similar name and aren't they both from Texas where as one of them out west\nI mean it it it's a common mistake I'm Still upset about it though but regardless [laughter] had a ...\nAnd Mickey and the comment that you're on the basic live yesterday and a lot of things you said before he got off the air was talking about like a health care and that they're going to have you know there's also how ... made and he's up there\nAnd I feel like that's been a lot of the rhetoric coming from the Democratic side is and like well you know Americans don't want to do the jobs are the immigrants are feeling um which\nI think it's kinda funny 'cause they you know push for it to the dollar minimum wage thing right and it's kind of just it just backwards you know if you let capitalism work or you know you reduce the amount of population that's going to work for low wages and now these people that are only willing to work for higher wages have leverage over them\nGreat point and and that's exactly true right so they're saying in one hand but they want higher wages\nAnd they're saying and the other hand that they want to raise the minimum wage is a federal minimum wage or needs to be raised as Austin is just to explain and then the other hand they're saying hey you people don't want these jobs which just give them the immigrants so the question is now what happens you raise the minimum wage you get the job doing immigrant now what\nHappens to like a a a a trade worker skilled worker who was making Fifteen dollars an hour what happens to his pay now does he just quit and go become a cleaning lady 'cause it's slightly easier than welding something uh you know what's what's the point what's the incentive\nPeople on the left never understand this and really Austin what's remarkable about this is the more advancements we haven't technology the more we don't need the minimum wage and here's what I mean by that\nWe now live in a world I'm surrounded by computers I'm surrounded by one two three four five five I have no less than five computers six if you count my cell phone here in the room with me\nAnd I can operate them all at the same time now imagine how many jobs\nCould essentially be done like data processing things like that that can be done with computing\nThat maybe don't require a lot of your attention you just have to monitor a computer you could have a macro doing the data processing for you a centrally that the minimum wage laws of screwed people out of taking advantage of a system like that you could take six or seven jobs at once if they paid four dollars an hour and do six or seven jobs at once\nJust by using a bunch of computers but because of the minimum wage laws that'll never be possible did I explain that clearly I've never I've talked about this before but\nAbsolutely I absolutely understand that and what's funny is like all the ... that left it you know they want to like Denmark as an example of you know great socialism and stuff which is not for free market economy right and they don't they don't have a minimum wage or sell\nIt though it's ... it's our capitalism ... backward yeah they they use the system out there that's not socialism you got that part right yeah it's it's something else and it's it's certainly is based on capitalism hey do you want to go to ... boys the most uh loews Lobos\nYeah it'd be happy to\nWhat you're going Austin hang on for a second my producer will get on the phone with you hook you up with that uh Brian in Santa Fe how are you sir\nI'm doing All right I heard you're lonely needed somebody to talk\nTo you I Love when people call the show I like when we are full phone lines I could talk to people all day on the radio it's my favorite thing to do man\nI noticed something more sort of like Ted Cruz\nAnd plus did it was how did you know oh you know\nAnd then the second guy was often for Richmond yeah he's cool it's like it's like he was on first [laughter]\nThat's fair but\nI wanted you to talk a little girl bloom or what's going on friday\nRight oh I saw a week from today is that what you're talking about we're doing is we're from the as far as I Know I don't know if we have any seats left for meeting of the minds but if you want an email me in fact I think we do do you want to go\nNo you've already you already sent me a thing their messenger I just I just wanted to bring it up on the show\nOh yeah it's one week from today it's happening right now and I'm Glad you reminded me and I'm Glad you reminded me of this year's one more thing I have T shirts for sale and if you want them just go to my social media pages they're dirt cheap they said pursuit of happiness radio on them you can get them any color you can get them as a ... a long sleeve whatever you want a\nAct Ken Webster chemistry junior on Facebook or producer Kenny on Twitter I gotta run folks Jimmy ... I Love all of you and I hope you have an awesome we got\nWhen you\nYour seat from the gallery furniture made in America studios this case he or she saw the\nThink that [noise]\n\n[noise] this is the Fox news alerts a mail\nBomb arrest me sobriety federal investigators detailing what led to the suspect even as more packages are found\nAs eternity general as confirmed we have a rest as these are say off in connection with this investigation boxes\nYou can go ahead and take it all with a grain of salt wait and see\nI'm just because he's a fan of Trump's assuming that's true just because he's a Trump supporter something that's true just because he you know targeted people who'd given the president a hard time does it mean that he did it because the president has been lashing out that these people on social media\nHe might have just made these decisions on his own because after all people like Robert De Niro been very public and the criticism\nHe won on national television other wards show it basically said F. you to the president\nWhy do we expect you don't need the president to say about that Robert Deniro said everything you need to know the social media pages that hurt me a link to this guy\nHe was arrested on a friday best today course multiple Facebook accounts there's a link to it like out there is a Twitter page that appear to belong to save or say Iraq they show his name they display many photos that strongly resemble him\nThe both of these appear to be from an ardent supporter of the president\nWants to despise many Democrats ... genesis by the way he's fifty six years old now I don't normally do understand or care whether they bother to tell us how all these people are but you know he's he's a grown as man I suppose we should know that he's not he's not some kid he's been around for a long long time\nHe is he describes itself by the way of social media is an entrepreneur or is he put it on linked in a promoter booking agent live entertainment odor and choreographer\nAre they missing there was consulting which is usually derby\nWe'll do it on first come first everybody says you'll have fun will be good will get a chance to meet each other ... which is a you know something I really enjoy doing All right\nWe're already scheduled our guess before we got an arrest but that's that's great because here's a guy\nWho's a conservative he's the co founder of the national Tea Party movement he served under Bush forty one at the White House\nAnd he has them the citizens of opinions on sure on how this president's been treated by the mainstream media joining us is Michael Johnson the co founder of the national Tea Party movement well we have an arrest Michael and bumper learning about him would seem to indicate that he was the don't jump in\nYou know I think it's almost maybe the most uh I think intelligence things to say at this point if maybe we don't know anything yet\nUm I happen to just have\nTaken a liberty of looking through the followers on Twitter who he was following that we're almost all liberals\nI'm On offset by the fact that he had in the car with a bunch of odd in some cases a right of center bumper stickers um he has a history of criminality no\nYeah it's a no direct political or policy involvement\nSpeak of I don't see anything that he's ever articulated any coherent message or formal affiliation and um\nYou know I think it's a reminder obviously that we have individuals you know of many persuasion across this country who um\nMay be predisposed to uh doing bad tanks and it\nYou know this guy we know this guy had a had done the yeah before so it's not the first time he's been ...\nI think it's a leap to sort of say that that there's any direct\nResponsibility here beyond the person who actually are conducted these high end residents and then he ... he may have had\nI agree ... let's say let's say for the sake of argument let's say he is a Donald Trump than let's say that he hates the media because of the way the media has been treating Donald Trump\nWhile you why you if you could blame him for ... you could just as easily blame the mainstream media but the way they treated the president is for the president responding to it after all is one of those he started and things I mean the president responded to the mainstream media because of the way they responded to him\n[noise] but I think that's a legitimate point and obviously the most professional component of all that should be media outlets they shouldn't be the ones\nAre setting an example of a balance temperament which isn't to say that they are uh [noise]\nYou know ... titled from having view point for strong editorial pages are making a point or in in very old wage in fact I argued the port is\nArrested I leave precisely because we have our First Amendment or write write to cause those tree exercise so falsely is\nOne of the reasons silences out early or unjustified in this country unlike autocratic\nTotalitarian regimes where in some respects it's the only vehicle for the expression of political opposition out tripling the case in\nA ... on the Cold War and and the battle against communism there was no after you for a transgender policy ideas are principles\nWe have found is opportunities for that are in the United states for individuals if any political persuasion and it makes it particularly inexcusable you see incidents like this occur and the only fortunate ... quite obviously is\nThat nobody was hurt a process of the whole\nMichael let me let me ask you this aspect of it do you know I bum affirmed staunch believe really constitution and our First Amendment rights to free speech there's no doubt about that in in I Believe newspapers do have a wide range especially as relates to the ... as far as what they can publish as far as the venues\nButter and I'm sure you heard of the um the Benghazi assassination piece the New York times posted\nBurning that that a lot like isn't that a lot like yelling fire and that granted the human\n[noise] well it really is I mean a whole the whole editorial concept behind that was to afford these fictional writers some degree of input I Believe on how the the older ... play out\nNow than a quarter broke what I wrote what right which was that it would it's probably gonna fade away pretty young remarkably and the biggest lingering questions or carry out with distracted the national attention for a\nYou know it was many years has it dead\nBut to have a writer actually you know\nGet into in graphic detail\nAttractive fascination president United States\nIs Israeli irresponsible and if you're if you're trying to look at apple defending first and then right and I wanted to be careful and I think we all have to be careful not to suffocate those right at the ... say where does sensibility why that would be supportive of fairly graphic example\nOf something that really is an adding anything to\nThe national policy dialogue or to the beach and clearly is both inflammatory and in the eyes of some condoning\nA level of a warrant violence or that we're trying to hurt our political dialogue\nAnd maybe it's like exist today at the worst thing that should not exist intermediate culture today and certainly not from a newspaper that while it may or may not be said for many years has has sort of carried itself as the premier a paper in this country\nWe're going to Michael Jones goes onto the national Tea Party movement you're on AM nine fifty cave your sees three thirty eight those I'm Michael\nI'm I'm no I'm I'm trying to I'm trying to think um\nHow I Would try to handle this if I were in President Trump's shoes I think he set the right tone\nA yesterday when he basically said there's\nNo excuse for anybody to be involved with this type of activity I I thought he was very presidential in his approach to this and the media turned around right\nAnd and and did what they had been doing all along\nAnd he's yet to retaliate which I give him credit for for for not retaliating but it's hard for me to imagine all along that blasted the media keeps doing what it's doing\n[laughter] well it really it was in many respects the offering of a\nHandshake of peace I extend it sort of without condemnation of either side\nViewpoint that many of us myself included hold is that we can make bold and articulate arguments and even hardest and arguments without\nInflaming uh our political culture and his message that we all ought to tone it down which presumably was perhaps self inclusive\nTo me was a unprecedented that came from his standpoint\nPerhaps even counter intuitive to some of his\nDemeanor and huge sleep\nBecause a lot of the issue is I think we're confining this is one of the extreme on these you know come out of that was on like diagnosed mental health issues across the country a suicide crisis that truly a a dangerous and threatening deserves attention and\nLots of undiagnosed or his id pressure and a more serious mental health issues I mean do you get to portray that accessible to people and a fishing for\nQuite a while and I think particularly became clear after nine eleven I remember being in New York ... complete shortage or a judge that were seeking a kind of assistance and it's true national exports as well kidding so I share that I think it would be very enlightening to at least one what can motivate someone to do something\nLike this and\nIf it was a message or if it was designed to harm people I think that's unclear as we speak at least\n... for the FBI said the we're not hoax bombs um so he they seem to think released from a forensic standpoint they were put together with the intention to harm\nUm which tells me the very least he couldn't get any one of the ... explode so if you if that was his intention he failed in that particular mission um\nDie also heard that I think part of the matching their take seriously any contraption of this nature and its components and then I think it's I think\nWhat he said further if it was exposed to certain heat or cold [noise] yeah uh and I'm going into graphic detail I mean this is it's a legitimate question is whether this guy was trying to send some message which of course is delusional and\nAlmost certainly uh you know took the country off of the serious national dialogue heading into a mid term election here and in a week and a half or or what they're getting ... do arm I suppose that's kind of the most important question and and I also\nGets on my own experience with with issues like this and I haven't seen them is typically when you have this magnitude federal law enforcement involved\nThey very commonly identified these individuals' early and actually followed them for some period of time until such time as are actually [noise] uh you know about ... and I were to stack and I believe that was the case here that you probably had the individual identified pretty early\nAnd at least for giving twenty four hours a\nA occupation and see if there was any broader conspiracy or a affiliates involved and I guess that's the that's the lingering question to answer doesn't change anything of that nature pop you know something given high profile elected officials at age to be seriously investigated\nRight and I surely will although it would appear at least at this point that the that he acted alone um the question of race I think all of us have on this is how concerned should I mean people people on the left you know they're claiming their concern over to something like this is they should be\nPeople on the right to have to be justice concern there have been many more adults against people on the rights of people on the left I mean the next time I'm you're having dinner in a restaurant in an activist comes running into the restaurant and we'll one wants to get up in your face\nYou know that's going to make people the ... it could very well go from being an act of aggression to begin to violence\nYeah I think that's totally true and that's why we don't want to create a\nCulture we do not want to send a message or you had to give examples like Hillary Clinton saying that we we can workshop tightening in civil until such time as well back in control\n[noise] er Maxine Waters saying to you or you know not make any place hospitable for political opponents or even the Obama and Philadelphia when he was running you know way talking upbringing you know if they were and night we had gone all these things might be\nYou know metaphorically benign but they send the wrong message and I think it's it's a reminder and nice to be particularly those on the left it's been a little reckless with is\nThat um [noise] this is a civil and it's not a civil war\nIt is a debate over what should the policy direction of the country clearly the country is divided our political leaders are divided and people feel very strongly one way or the other but we need to get back to a point where the best like ... years flourish\nNot where we're using tactics that or a ...\nFew you know human ... which is what all that shit that's the basis of representative democracy and and civil government is that we're able to attract people into public service uh without fear that they're putting our lives\nMichael how do you think this um manifests itself in the midterm elections we're just days away from the ... do you think this this story Lebanese are going to do with voter turnout or all people who say you know I\nI yeah I think it's very important question because I think one thing that is clear\nIs it over the last forty eight hours we've had a really good number of very serious developments in the country outside is a one was the president's announcement yesterday on on drug pricing and the dish it's a it's a ministry correctly is taking to a\n... the uh the pricing issues around on around Medicare and other drug\nMethodologies bringing those prices more down more reasonably [noise]\nUh yeah it's been outrages hikes as someone who worked in that profession that they're selling same medications in foreign countries it at a fraction of the races are being sold into our public system that story got completely lost his results that's\nAnd I think as president for the first time in Thirty years at least it's taken some really substantial reforms and very constructive once\nAnd then the other issue caravan that uh\nKnow President Trump was elected on very important ... very passionately as strongly about I Know ... ... is the only real incredibly strongly about it that it's this border needs to be secure I mean it's just absurd that we can have this core wicked effort a few\nYou know blatantly cross or order and that that's sort of master juniors going out in our hemisphere and we have no ... tablet\nBarrier methodology to protect our borders\nOr is that a ... with ... corn referendum that we have to I think the reason why people are are so suspicious\nOf um of the media and so suspicious of of the other side of this particular cases because every time you know the president tries to roll out of the program but my my\nMight be something that Americans are more than just conservative persuasion can get on board with you have a story like this is just blocks of the way I mean not that not that NBC or CNN or going to cover a story like that but at least Fox would have covered it if they were so busy covering the story\nI Believe that that for no good to talk to you sir thank you for your time this afternoon Michael Jordan I\nKnew that you go farther to national tea party movement that's Michael John you're on a a nine fifty K.

N. dot com to eight one two zero three seven five three seven it's doing one to zero three seven five three seven\nOr this morning on a case your age we talked to this guy about October surprises you know this is when we knew we had somebody sending out\nThese are like bombs now we think we know that somebody is and there's been an arrest so let's start with this one Jim Henson over there at University of Texas\nI'm this book we have learned about who this guy is and what his motivations might be is that in your mind constituted an October surprise [noise]\nWell I think it has the possibility to to impact the election and the way that you know we think of October\nSurprises doing whether it's decisive or not I think is another is another question but clearly and it still awful early but if this suspect does in fact turn out to be the person doing this and the records have been true that he did seem to have some pretty strong partisan leanings\nOr it'll undoubtedly become something that gets processed into the election particularly given the discussion of civility and mobs and all of this that have been that have been already present in the mid term elections so I think we are looking at something October surprise or not\nThat's probably going to enter into the political bloodstream if you will\nOr will be interesting to see how does it because I I think that uh that people on the right things you know have a tendency to to blame the media for the things that the president doesn't the president they does as well and the meaning of course blames the president for the ... instability\nSo I don't know I don't know if anybody's minds gonna get changed about who's to blame for all that\nWell and I think that's why I think you know whether you know whether it\nReally has an impact on the outcome I I agree with you that something like this is going to be very easily fit into everybody's preexisting part is some frames\nAnd you know you just implied it's it's not too hard to predict how\nPresident and his partisans are going to see this and it's not too hard to predict how the president's opponents and the Democrats are going to see this and whether it really changes any mind seems fairly unlikely to me\nYou've you've been doing this quite a while I have a new gym taking ... yeah you got to feel feeling out to the the voting public have you ever seen in a time where we have been more divided than what we are right now\n[noise] you know I ... I really haven't it's been something that's been building and the time that I've been doing this and you know look we've had some we've had some peaks that we're a little bit close I think that um\nThe aftermath of the Iraq of the Iraq War was very polarizing and you saw a lot of people that were [noise] there's defenders of the president and and pierced opponents in that I think certainly after the passage of the Affordable CARE Act Brock Obama became a very polarizing figure [noise]\nBut I Do think that the moment we're in now seems to be stretching even beyond those moments and part of it seems to be I think that there's no there's no real\nLow insight I mean I just it's hard for me to imagine that will get through these elections and and people will say okay well we we sort of settled this for the for the time being and let's go back to a slightly lower volume but just it seems like we're we're jammed eleven right now [noise]\nUm it it seems to me is well Jim Henson that are back in the day if you will um you have almost as many people identify themselves as independents as Gore identify themselves as a Republican or Democrat\nOr do you find that there's still that large salad majority out there or have most people at this point decide\nWell I mean I I think it's always been a little bit\nI think the number of people that are truly independent has always been somewhat overestimated and I think\nThe trick here is not so much that there are fewer people that are independence but that\nThe parties are more dominated by there are more ideological way so I think that well the number of independence is probably about where it was if we take about true independents and not just people that say they're independent but ultimately\nHave attitudes and behaviors that are more like part as she said real independence I think the problem is that you know once you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
