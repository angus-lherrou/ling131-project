T. as the I Know these are issues that I Know these are problems and I as an animal lover and an animal owner I can tell and yes I sit owner\nNot parents\nIsn't it a little older I I understand that these can be very very helpful but there are certain categories let's start with this there are certain categories of animals that I think you are uniquely qualified to\nFill that particular category dogs cats\nUm big things are pretty smart\nThat you have to necessarily be smart to be an emotional support animal but I Would think you know if we're going to put a vest on this animal and we're going to take it in public whether you're talking about a restaurant or some other public convenience than than it has to be something that you can count on how to behave itself in public\nThe police

no more slack off be here tomorrow thinks he's going to know that it would be my first friday shows I did my first friday show huh\nI'll have to figure out what kind of a theme we want to do for friday's and no I'm not going to do like open line friday every talk show host in America does open mind friday we need to think of something something slightly more original creative within that All right um\nYeah Halloween on my mind today for some reason maybe maybe because I think this is it may be because in my neighborhood it seems like the neighbors have put more and more of an effort into decorating for Halloween than they do for Christmas and I'm not quite sure how we feel about that\nI mean I'm not one of well I guess one thing I Need to take into consideration is kind of live in the United nations of neighborhoods there are people from all across the country who living here they're all races colored Z a creeds and national origins\nSays like the un in here so there are I'm sure there are plenty of people in here who are not Christian and don't celebrate Christmas so that would account for some of them\nUm but it's interesting to me that there's so many people who have decorated for Halloween ... and not just put a pumpkin on the porch or you know put some bums out I mean they're they've got\nRules and goblins and stuff hanging up off the house they got 'em hanging off the trees they've got they've got to be on the cob webs everywhere it's the it's amazing and then there's my little house and I haven't done anything yet\nI don't know why but\nAll these people putting all these decorations up it brings out the competitiveness of me I'm not sure why that is is that it does that do that to you um when you see a couple of people here for example for Christmas I'm much more into decorating for Christmas lamb for Halloween Halloween is just it's you know\nFirst of all\nIt it it's it's a holiday for kids at least always thought of as a holiday for kids I mean I kind of lost interest in Halloween to be honest with you or the day I stopped going out to trick or treating after that I really didn't care much about it anymore\nWhat's the point of Halloween if you can't go out and get you get your tricks and treats\nSo I kind of gave up on it you know until I became an adult I had kids of my own and then like I watch Halloween through their eyes and then\n\nYou know they grew up they start having kids and that can watch it through through their eyes\nBut in between there's really not been a whole lot of reasons to get that excited about Halloween but the it seems like kids now\nGet as excited or more excited by Halloween than they do for for for the other holidays and I'm just wondering what is it about Halloween this got everybody so jazzed up\nAnd why do so many adults\nGet into Halloween not I've been trying to figure this out and I've asked people you know and maybe you ever thought or to seven month redoing to buy ... especially if you are really into Halloween to you like dressing up for Halloween and\nYou know one of those one of those people who like maybe there's a whole costume thing either for work or or to pass out the candy the trick or treaters I'd love to hear at seven three to five fifty but\nI'm just curious what is it about Halloween that people just seem to be so crazy about\nNow the only thing I can figure about the whole dressing up thing is is it's an opportunity the number one to act like a kid I guess I'm it's also an opportunity to be somebody other than yourself\nWhich always find very interesting I think you can tell a lot about who a person is based on their choice for who they were going to pretend to be for Halloween now this is going back to just go back a few years is back during the Clinton years in fact\nUm while\nI dressed up as member after the whole Monica Lewinsky thing I I dressed up as Bill Clinton\nAnd Mike [laughter] 'cause we had a holiday that I think that's the last time was actually added a build all the way and party so I wore a I'm a ... shirt and tie you know white shirt Howard tie a suit coats boxer shorts with no parents\nA wink tip shoes would dress socks and I had a cigar in my mouth and remember if you remember that whole thing you'll know exactly what the scar was over\nAnd then in a really bizarre twist because my wife Elizabeth loves the wizard of Oz she dressed up as Dorothy\nOnly she was kind of like a Monica Lewinsky version of Dorothy or at least the idea was that bill was hitting Dorothy\nIs actually it was pretty funny now they think about it but that's really the last time I I I participated in dressing up like something for Halloween and I'm I'm just curious if you feel like you've noticed the same thing do you feel like you've noticed that\n\nThe more ... more people seem to be participating or more excited and decorating and participating for Halloween almost than they do for the Christmas holidays seven won three two one two five nine fifty oh by the way I'm told that because I'm the house with a full sized candy bars I don't need to decorate\n[laughter] no nobody will care Bible bumped up is always the ... and got the bulls eye candy bars please remember the full sized candy bars or not for kids are getting busted in I don't reward kids who are who are ah not neighborhood kids\nWith all sized candy bars the problem is we've only been in this neighborhood for years on and there's a big neighbor it I'm not sure if I can I can identify some of the kids I don't know that I could have done it by all these kids as far as who's legit and who isn't legit against seven with three two one two\nOr five nine fifty to participate during the program I always curious to what you have to say can in clear like have you noticed the same thing by the way but more and more people seem to be getting into Halloween versus getting into Christmas as far as decorating\nIt that way and then they ... they they are a lot of oil law she I think decorate for Halloween and they do for a\nChristmas but I remember when my kids were little weight would take about trick or treating it or not they're all grown now but ... still got a cartoonish kind of stuff out in the front yard\nWe had a chance to get the kids and it's really kind of fun to figure out a way I look on their faces you know when you give them the best that we raise we do every man for you know I was like what our kids were little\nYeah what was the last time to think back here for me the last time that you actually dressed up for Halloween to remember what your costs the U.S\nI think what ... ... I think one year last year I took the kids they dress the up is what I can remember okay\nIt's a it's a fairly easy one to go through a lot of Gaza that way but\nOh yeah absolutely it was ... ... yeah it was simple [laughter]\nHere's what I Wonder do you think you could get away with being a ghost anymore and using a bed sheet\nBut at the end of the day or the folks\nAt bill advisor had come up\nWith a great home owner's insurance program they sell their own home owner's insurance they give you a great coverage and they found that they can see the average family eight hundred dollars or more per year on their home owner's insurance that's a lot of money right back in your pocket\nThe beauty of this is this your and he'd have to talk to a person in order to find out if they can save your money all you have to do is text the word\nSave as the the that save SAD\nTwenty three twenty three twenty three they'll text back and ask you for your address you send them your address that's how they could look up your home\nAnd again it's a matter of public record so it's stuff like you know you're giving them top secret information\nUm they can see how many square feet you have with the building construction is um where you live as far as whether or not is there a floodplain or any of those types of things that they can recommend a great policy for you and a great price and get that information back to you in really a matter of seconds\nIs a great way to shop and again you'll have to talk to any person to do it just takes the word save SAD either twenty three twenty three twenty three or go to bill advisor dot\nCom that's bill advisor\nDot com All right we're talking about um Halloween politically incorrect Halloween costumes\nWe're talking about um the participation in your neighborhood do you find that more people seem to participate in Halloween than they do and Christmas and the sure how I feel about that\nBy the way I have no problem with a Halloween I'm not one of those I think it's about the death all I'm not one of those kinds of people I think it's just good clean innocent fun is what it is and and I understand why do some kind of like the skate by dressing up although um sometimes\nThey where some of the most inappropriate costumes especially women for some reason what's\nWith all the sexy nurses in the sexy this the sexy that now I'm not complaining mind you I'm just saying\nI'm you know I'm not sure how it would feel the list but wanted to address that way for Halloween I'm not sure uh I I'm pretty sure how would feel if I had a daughter who is like Eighteen or sixteen who wanted to dress up that way I think in that but that was a real problem I had for a while\nDo they still make those sexy costumes for kids for a while they were making sexy costumes for kids that just that mean that that is just all kinds of wrong here's the other thing I've noticed the amount of businesses that are participating\nIn Halloween now now on ... road in the spring area where I live there is a car wash\nThat is set up with all kinds of characters outside and I'm not a hundred percent sure but it looks to me like they're going to have a hunted car wash your car wash where you go into wash your car and you've got scary characters that are they're\nKind of like a haunted house of leaves a car wash\nI'm going to make a suggestion here's something if you're thinking about doing this or if you have a kid let's say you advocate you drive past a haunted car washing the car is dirty you want to watch it and the kids the kids say\nI Want to go in there I Want I Want to see the car wash\nYou might want to think about it at first I have an actual example\nYeah by the way if you want to view it it's on her sister station website ... dot com just click on a used as more than usual funded there here is a recording of a mom and her kids is they go through a pretty doggone scary halted carwash take a listen to this [noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nThat kid now officially qualifies for an emotional support animal\n[laughter]\nNo before before we get too upset with the with a bomb in this case I I can honestly see how something like this would happen you know your your kids they think it's good to be good right they're all it's like a scary movie oh this'll be good clean fun you know they're all about it I can do\nBecause we're probably say mom come on I Want to go through the whole car wash let's go through the whole car wash\nAnd she posted All right bye will go through the whole the car wash and then you get in line for the car wash and there's cars behind you\nAnd there's no work to kids start to get scared and there's no work for you to do you have no escape route you're stuck you're still going through the car wash in your kids are freaking out now what\nWell there's a part of you just want your kid to freak out but it is or the other party that says you know a junior you got this ... this is exactly what you asked for you wanted to be scared we're going to get you scared to be the last time I have to go through a whole car wash\nI'm assuming dumb I'm given the parent of a break here because I don't know do the exact circumstances because I can see that happening just as much as I can see the parents that gives a good idea to take their young kids\nThrough the car wash in by the way to check out the video you'll see that there's some guy dressed up like Mike Myers from all the way that it's just I mean\nHe is he's scared the heck out of me by the way I probably shouldn't do this this bus ride you'll know where I live in a way you want to scare me for Halloween yeah I mean if you really want is obviously scare\nMe dress up like a clown I'm yeah I'm One of those of one of those I'm One of those I'm One of those are free to clone people especially you don't you don't want to develop\nThat a twofold\nA we have a neighbor when I was a kid growing up and um he used to dress up I'm as a nurse with a bubble but made by the balloons a nurse clown that was really creepy looking up because you every year he participated in the Memorial Day parade in this little town I grew up in\nAnd he kind of scared me but what really drove me over the edge was Stephen King\nYou know it\nAnd um I saw the original it's\nWho's at Tim ... it was too great was played that penny wise petty why is he was scary the remake I haven't seen I I don't think you know I'm I'm a grown as adult but I don't think I could sit down and watch the remake\nOf that movie without getting thoroughly scared alright love Halloween for one day we got like ...\nI'm sure we'll talk about again because I always do a couple of weeks away All right next to the program you might have heard that they were going to get into this in some detail with a great guy Richard Ross ... a a certified financial planner\nHe's also I think goes to certify crisis counselor 'cause I always seem to have conversations with them right after the Dow was going through tough done another big loss of the Dow today so we'll see what he's thinking about what's going on when we talk to him this next hour [noise]\n\n\nGotta

drive you crazy sometimes don't they so San Francisco well but the human poop is the stuff that's really the big problem I think in San Francisco\n...
