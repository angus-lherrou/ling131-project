talking about them civility\nAs it relates to politics of which there's precious little left [laughter]\nAnd I don't know where we go from here joining us to talk about that and and I also want to talk a little bit to sort of the evolution if you will of the Tea Party\nMichael ... the co founder of the national Tea Party movement served during the Bush forty one White House Michael welcome to our program here and keep your seat um have you ever talk to anybody ... yeah do you ever talk to anybody from the left\nI Can't do it in a I used to find it easier than I have lately I find that it's just the ... a lot of difficulty with it now it's not for lack of effort on my part it's just I think\nLike a wall you know there's just not a lot of absorption of even trying to understand conservative perspective which you know and honestly I mean I'm\nOf the world with a ... pretty uniformly almost conservative view but I've always done it in a thoughtful way being\nThe conclusions that I reached are always subject to revision based on facts that may not be aware of based on prospectus they may not have absorbed [laughter] I don't think I ever it's gotten\nTo a point where I feel so arrogant that there's not something more to learn or something were to consider these issues that are ultimately ended the day and I just usually important they're usually complex\nYeah you know for the for the left today do you think um the way they've reacted to this presidents and the way they are not reacting to conservatives in general is based on\nMenus may sobriety things but certainly emotion is a big part of it um and when you're when you were using nothing but emotion in your thought process you're really not thinking things through very well are you\nKnow and I think I really don't feel it's\nGetting president President Trump even an opportunity to try to work with them and I think he would be inclined to work with them I think he made that clear a verbal either he doesn't like to see that break down as a bipartisanship or at least partisan by parsing the dialogue on these issues\nAnd there's been so many opportunities over ... over the last\nTwo years now for them to have made constructive um\nContributions to some of these debates and some of these policy proposals\nAnd I think you know as opposed to trying to be helpful around the margins were to offer their input they would much rather just stand in the side and criticized and push anyone can do that I mean it's easy to send them to do in the world and it is to you know served\nUnder leadership and other political constituency and it just sort of say we can't go down that path and of course they've been ... by Hollywood by the media culture and by academia that if in pretty uniformly in their corner and that's the one thing I I've certainly discovered in and\nSort of analyzing their argument is just how can they are and I think they fall apart and watch it but\nThey they are a lot of groupthink on that site and I think that's another sort of component to that [noise] you know lead to such hard in a position\nAnd such you know inability to kind of for each what could be some middle ground and that really is one of the biggest political shifts of our lifetime 'cause if I went back to the Nineteen nineties like for instance in the\nClinton Administration Bill Clinton administration I mean there were a lot of\nDifferences but there was a dialogue and that was Republican contribution to some of those legislative and shit like welfare reform I think the balanced budget debate I think a lot of those contributions\nYou can see Newt Gingrich other Republican leaders who had the prince all look at because they chose to be constructive players as opposed to be\nA disengaged and on and on the sidelines and I think well real disservice to the country for them to be approaching it the way they are now currently\nCompared to compare to the left of today the Democrats have do they Bill Clinton was a was virtually a conservative use more of a Republican or the ... the ... Democrats\nRight well I I think that's one of the observations you have to make is that we're not even arguing really with a heart and ideology right now or a coherent ideology because many positions they\nDeveloped as we had more of a populist Republican president\nOr had been completely reverse Trump positions they held the mayor of Fifteen Years ago there was a time or not the Democratic party believe we should secure the southern border\nThat was a time when they had concerns about illegal immigration there was a time when they felt we had to be doing more to um crack down on crime for instance domestically there was a time when they didn't think the United states should be kicked around in the world and today's Democratic Party has banned in all the leaves\nAnd really in the position whatever President Trump and the conservative movement or for or against\nDuncan Michael John McCain can can you take what they're going to stick with it because they I don't think they have a policy that Don ... very difficult to dissect you're getting out so he can't articulate\nSomething can't articulate something that doesn't exist talking to Michael John's go onto the national Tea Party movement here on Cape Cod I'm nine fifty I'm here's here's where I think um things have hit it definitely changed in and they continue to change for the wars and that is we we're at the point now\nWhere um what let me read this I got I got this a few minutes ago it's granted it's it's a a solicitation for a campaign donation [laughter] but it was written by Steve ... so I think we all do um is this friend the radical left is panicking\nAnd that also means you know hearing out\nIt's difficult as it may be some times according to a few points and getting into some of\nThese districts that had for so long been represented by Democrats who I don't think it particularly well serve them and spreading our message and spreading are um vision of open opportunity\nAnd about what we can do differently to make this country that are in all respects I think if we do that in a respectful way and we will respond to along along the way and we always put the country's best interest at the forefront\nUm I think we set the example for how political engagement should be conducted in constructed\nSpeaking of one of those Democrats will keep sending to Congress I'm sure you're familiar with the Houston representative Sheila Jackson Lee right\nYep and now we've got ... that's one of 'em [noise]\nOne of her a former staffers Jackson Cosco accused of boxing Republican senators by leaking their personal information\nOr he's being held by the judge now without bond because the judge says these the risk to the community they up on cocaine and methamphetamine during a search of his possessions\nAnd speculated he may have been under the influence when he used his government credentials to post personal information on some lawmakers during this whole cabinet nomination fracas\nUm of course they're saying he broke into a senator's office while threatening to release other information Sheila Jackson Lee claim that first claim but he was an intern I haven't heard a whole lot more about what you have to say about it now\nBut you know it it's another example here's somebody who is willing to do something to highly illegal in order to try for their cause we really are at the points with some of these folks worry at the end at the end justifies their mind the means whatever means necessary\nYeah I mean you mentioned the school is a great patriot and\nMember of Congress earlier and ... and he ultimately the perfect example of how why this stuff is so dangerous I mean ultimately if you go back to what transpired in Alexandria, Virginia at a person from out of town or ride\nWith a list of Tea Party congressman came out of the Tea Party caucus who he arrived with the intention of killing in the interests of some political agenda\nAnd where did you get those ideas I mean it's true of course that you have a lot of people in the country in the empty you know stable won all respect center influenced by rhetoric that influenced by messaging and it's why I think all the engaged in this in a professional capacity\nHe'd always be delivered isn't careful in how we address these things and I don't think that the left Democratic Party has done that and that might seem\nIn case of jak suddenly he's eight to ...\nYou know what kind of teenage prank but it's not that's a real serious issues are real serious ... and it puts real lives in danger and the judge has appropriately looked at it very seriously\nA bike all let's listen to a quick little a perimeter if you will on where we're coming up with the Tea Party now I I remember the Tea Party but first began I was in Richmond, Virginia and we had a little rally downtown in over ten thousand people showed up and I went wow\nAnd never dreamed I'd never dreamed there would be so many people who turn out for an event like this and then it kind of swung to the point where the Tea Party was upgraded is the only ones left of the tea partier bunch of\nUltra right wing wackos and then uh you know I'll be honest with you your program directors and talk radio rather countries that don't we talk to the Tea Party people anymore you know makes it sound like you're like you're right wing nut job kind of thing\nAnd and and now it feels like the Tea Party has sort of take it as places is is an organization that although much much smaller is doing what he can devote candidates would real conservative values and then support the\nRight yeah I think one of the unfortunate reality is the last nine years as we did allow kind of consistent with\nI mean I guess some of the reservations that I had about political discourse to allow some other enemies to try to define us but if you just go back to the founding moving toward two thousand nine we coalesced around three very simple principles that could not be more in the mainstream\nOf American political dialogue and discourse and that was a cure for the constitution\nLimited government and lower taxes\nThere's nothing extreme about the Tea Party movement the extreme positions have been in those that have been taken in opposition to that agenda and I think both\nThe simplicity of the founding principles and then the political success winning the house in two thousand and winning the to the Senate and two dozen fourteen\nAnd then ultimately language foundation which we could have\nLiterally a populist president running against his own party and secured the nomination with all the byproduct of the political engagement grassroots Tea Party movement Donald Trump's victory I\nThink even in private people the ... seat with ... with us this was not a product of the Republican National committee is a product of a populist conservatism and he uh he tramped over\nParty not because of the party and that was really what we did is that people are now I think you know one of the single greatest contributions that we have offered and continued for was that when\nObama was elected there was a lot of outrage in the country but no one really knew how to channel that constructively rate so that could answer write letters to the editor or they could you know right there congressman but they kind of aware of the limitations of their influence these things\nAnd what the Tea Party movement offered and continues to offer is something that did not historically exist not as an opportunity for constructive engagement and the political process both around as you correctly said that he has candidate the election of candidates\nThe development of our policy agenda get representation of agenda the public\nI'm correcting liberals when they'd miss represent those ideals isn't any wage dreamer out to the conventional norms of the country I mean we we were looted on founding principles of the nation in part because that's inherent to American is not just conservatism and certainly not the Republican Party\nDo you think back to ... do you think\nThis has been the story of Tea Party political success truly got\nVery quickly 'cause we only have about a minute left but do you think he got painted with that brush because you were posing an African American president and you had a lot of members of your own party quote unquote mainstream Republicans who are a little scared of what it was you were doing\nI think ... the identity political instincts up the last ... um were the ones that they seized on as opposed to arguing with the substance the reality is that we've had you know really decent representation of African Americans in the Tea Party including leadership positions in including around national leaders that are that you would recognize that we have\nBeen supportive and I think it was just the easiest broad stroke they could brush against a populist movement\nLike Michael thank you so much for joining us

titled the segments um mistakes were making with are grown ask kids pardon my French on that one but um what we have here is a survey that basically says that if we're going to be completely honest about it that\nWe are paying for things for our adult children that\nWe probably well I shouldn't even has the same probably that we shouldn't be doing that um we're paying cell phone bills were paying rent payments were paying car payments\nWe're we're we're um\nWe're doing things for these kids\nFor a variety of different reasons I think one of the most common reasons is that we we don't like to see our kids suffer we've talked about this so many times we don't like to hear our our our kids suffer we'd all like to see our kids struggle\nIn any way shape or form or maybe it's as simple as well I don't want I don't want him to get to you all bad credit ready because he campaigns bills on time\nBut the question is and I'm not suggesting by the way that there isn't an appropriate time to lend your kid a couple of bucks\nBut they're just out now given an adult child money on a regular basis to pay for things that they should be paying for themselves I don't believe we're really doing their kids a whole other favorites when we do that now that having been said\nI'm by no means perfect and if I think back I'll probably I could probably come up with a couple of examples with my own two sons were I probably paid for something that in hindsight maybe I shouldn't have paid for I I never paid rent or house payment for my kids\nI've never I'm a paid a credit card bill for my kids I've never played a cell phone bill for my kids I um I I think the last time I actually paid for anything of any significance was a during the course of um my oldest son getting married\nOr when he was in college because I felt that was that was part I I felt personally in a lot of people don't buy felt personally that was part of ideal I made an agreement that I was going to get these kids are through their educational process and then you know your adults\nYou go out and you get a job and you earn a living and you buy what you could afford to buy and what you can't afford to buy you have

willing to be tough on it so he or she will go behind your back and help out your son or daughter and you find out about it\nAfter the fact that happens\nThat happens a lot in in in some cases it can cause enough friction in the marriage where people will just say you know what I'm I'm I'm not going to try to fight this because this is a no win proposition for me this is just going to cause flooding in problems with the marriage and I know I don't want that and I don't need that\n[noise] but both parents being on the same same page when it comes to these types of issues I think that's kind of important or maybe you have somebody else in your family\nWho's made this kind of mistake and that's not unique or unusual either maybe you have a a cousin or brother or sister who was done this and now you're seeing how it some sort of rearing its ugly head um I have I've a friend\nAnd I'll get to his story here in a in a minute or two he he has a grown as daughter\nAnd she's in her twenties and she's done with college and cheese gotten very used to having daddy take care of things for her and she's an only child and you know she's the daughter daddy's little girl and all the

us here on this Wednesday afternoon for your drive\nHome we're we're talking about [laughter] we're talking about helping our kids you know and and I and I understand the desire to to help your kids\nI you know I Want to help\nMy kids too I just struggle is I think so many of us do with how far do you go in helping your kids\nWhere it becomes a detriment and I'm starting tell a story here a few minutes ago let me tell the story real quick before we bring our next guest who by the way is apparently expert I checked out her Youtube videos um you may want to check them out to she's tough she really has tough I mean she's like she's like old school like my parents\nBut at any rate um this friend of mine whose name was Brian he has a he has a daughter only child it's a girl daddy's little girl kind of a thing and um he went through a divorce\nAnd and I think\nI think that's where at least part of all this is coming from because it's the divorces cause I don't know if you have if you have a conscience even if you know it's something you're gonna have to do\nThat it ... the the marriages of working at it and it's not good for anybody you still feel guilty especially if you still have young children\nSo we have a tendency sometimes to make up for that guilt by buying our kids things\nAnd that has evolved into just they get used to getting stuff from you\nI'm they don't ... some of them don't really seem to have a desire to do go wild in in er in it for themselves why go out and work hard for something if you can get it for free and the cubs become sort of a cascading problem\nAfter that you know Cooper was telling us this last that for about you know he's got three kids a couple of them in college and you know he's an aggy so they they can they can afford to do nice things for their kids but he did bring up the point that this this survey said this Marilyn survey\nWhich is how many people are behind financially preparing for their own retirement as a result of this let's bring another parenting expert ... to talk about all this it's um\nIt's not just a matter of enabling your kids or if you are if you are spending money on them every month to pay their bills and you can't put aside money for yourself what happens to you and somebody needs to take care of you I Hope those same kids are going to take in right\n[laughter] that's what you out and giving it to be with you and it's such a\nHot topic to talk about and and you mentioned that word enabling them and that's an issue I mean I think our lawn powered log dot com and that's what we always talk about it's not about empowering your kids and and let's just talk about this this surf hay\nAnd that comment by the way they looked at what's called temporary pair [laughter] which they don't get me a this is going backwards not for it so that they're talking about\nThe survey is based on\nWhite parents now spend annually on their eight to ten thirty four year old do\n\nThis is on top of what I was actually on top this we should point this out this is on top of the average\nOf two hundred and thirty thousand dollars that they already spent getting that kid age Eighteen\nThank you so we're talking about somebody that has more working years I had to them then typically in most of the parents of kids ... kids that age\nUm so what is their their spin twice on your own age don't get thirty four year old parents are being twice the amount\nOn their kids and they they contribute each year to their own retirement fund\n[noise] yeah well I wanted well well it\nIs I think a little bit it takes a minute to to to let that sink in\nI mean we're talking about thirty four year old that you're going to still have hey there and they break it down and said what sell cell phone and yeah I'm Sorry I ... we have three boys and Twenty one much like you know there's ... and there I can guarantee and they're just in their early ...\nI can guarantee you and thirty four I Am not going to be paying for sort of cell phone bill\n[laughter]\n... what do you talk to parents all the time um ... what kinds of excuses do they give you for for helping these kids out of other than the the the traditional one that we have for all of our helicopter parents they don't want their kids to struggle [noise]\nWell you know it's helicopter parents that we've done is that going on the line or parents which is like helicopter parenting on scare right\nAnd they just you know they don't really realize that two thirds\nOf them are sacrificing their own financial security for the sake of their children because they they want to get right by their cats they went their kids have a good life you know they want and you get well and you know well mom I really want this you know a hundred and twenty five dollar I'm sure\nWell that would go for it\nYou know what I mean you're ... you're doing harm you know but it seems like such a simple\nAnswer um [noise]\nI I don't know I I I guess I'm struggling trying to figure out where the disconnect isn't in maybe ... ... it's a it's a matter of parenting and I was talking about that whole\nWhole divorce thing beforehand is that part of the problem we have are a lot of these adult kids from divorced families where one parent or maybe both parents are trying to make up for having put their kids through divorce the family splitting",
