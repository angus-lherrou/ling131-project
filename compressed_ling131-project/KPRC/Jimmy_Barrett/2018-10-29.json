Patrick and Michael berry and all that he start thinking differently I guess you have it at a different point of view\nAnd we got to go to Ted Cruz rally years ago when he um was that stood on the Senate floor and filibustered for as long for that time\nPeriod yes and so we got to do that without digital Ted Cruz and I think that was more or less a turning point point from him for him\nBecause he was like um like he was elected to do this to try his best to stop the Obama bill and that's where he was doing it for a while and he did he what he said he was going to do and that's why he was like okay if you start looking at what they're saying they're going to do and what do they actually doing\nSo going to you being a conservative and your husband being a Democrat is there ever a rift in your house or do you oh yeah how do how do you guys do what that does it affect your ah you know you're not not necessarily\nLove life you know you got outside the bedrooms outside the bedroom\n[laughter] I cried usually thought of that out here and here we are in here\nFor some people that might be a turn it on like oh I get to sleep with somebody from the other side I'm not sure I Know you're sort of listen to this interview so I'm not going to try to make that\nTo make that the focus of this because he and\nMy husband go at it all the time and my son has been question at school or are you black his back bragging assessment question the same thing goes for my daughter um their blackness this question of like you were born but I cannot choice but to be black wasn't the heck does that mean are you bragging ... can you not see my color\nPeople like if you see me you don't see my God I'm like I Can't help but see a color I'm trying to pass the ... what is it about you that makes you you you're more than just your caller we\nAll have a color we all bleed red what makes you you\nWow that is so beautiful Glenda I mean it's Halloween time we're all skeletons on the inside you know what I mean every all at the same at one point and other\nEvery one of us it's it's absolutely true yeah we're all in the middle I'm ... I think that's so awesome and I so I Wonder what what what a black people think about when when other black people tell you you can't have this opinion or you can't\nYou can't share that ideology what does the word they use Uncle Tom I always thought there was a weird branding especially as like\nUncle Tom's soda or you want to be known all that stuff that's what the typical words are but I generally don't discuss politics much because I'm like generally the odd person out\nOf them have that conversation if somebody asks me I'll tell them and then they just look at me like I'm Crazy\nAnd I lost my mind and they move on I'm like okay well you asked I told you\nSure yeah I feel you\nKnow automatically assume everybody in the room goes along with you\nSo so so what comes next for your son now is he going to get more involved in politics I mean this must have been she she was like you said he was already influenced by Ted Cruz filibustering Obamacare and the and I say mhm do you think that this is I mean I'd I'm Out meeting with the president is really got to be a life changing experience\nYeah he he is super high right about now he's ... he this weekend is totally hide them up he was already um outspoken about his political beliefs as it is he's not like me more reserved against because over time is like I don't want to hear people talk about how could you do this you're black now\nAnd so he's like oh yeah I Believe that he has no problem than it so I don't know what the whole time but I Know that all of this has been an influence on them like say the Ted Cruz rally right ways of into to town hall meetings with a map Patrick and share fryer and he was able to give his opinion there and go into different things\nSo I Do see them in politics he said he more or less the U.S I was more like a\nHe's going toward a legal now but at first time one time is I'm a journal but I Know isn't because he wants more the truth man told and that's his whole thing from this past week and he's like mom deadline\nI have never heard of like I've heard him say about fake news but like I see it for myself this is really ache no\nRight and really is so you know it's an interesting thing I mean when I Lived in Chicago the Democrats in Chicago as progressive as they get and then I moved to Houston and one of the first thing I noticed here is um black Democrats in Houston are very conservative by Democrats standards they are [laughter] I I\nMean they they tend to be you have traditional views of marriage they tend to they're not big fans of abortion they don't want to have transgender bathroom right it's not a big cause for them and\nI I don't think it is for most people are going to I mean this has been an awesome radio segment I'm so glad that you called in and I really appreciate you I Know you set off the air you can't make it in this Friday but if you have any friends I Want to come out\nAh to our town hall we're having here we've got a few seats left and I'd love to get somebody on a ... and calling anytime you're you're a great call her going to I really appreciate your time thank you [laughter] thank you so much give you did a great job on raising ... and I am and I hope you'll let him do we feel that way\nFolks I Am a I'm Ken Webster June this has been pursuit of happiness radio for the past our we have tried to make sense of a national tragedy and tried to shine some light on something that actually happened this weekend that was good in positive and that's not something\nYou're going to get for most media outlets today so much returning and folks have a great day out there trying to save\nMean the\nIsraeli\nYour when you\nKeep your sea Houston and I are radio station\n... members of studios will come to your ... going to\n\nThe heat at least the Brady talked me those words from a rabbi moments ago at a synagogue in Pittsburgh ra Lebanon worshippers were killed on Saturday\nWhich of course is enough to through just about everybody gets a lot of work does it make any sense to do daylight saving time anymore\nOr if we are going to do daylight saving time does it make sense to switch back and forth between standard time and daylight saving time should we just kind of pick a time and stick with it\nRather than go back and forth I mean what are we really achieving here with all this doesn't hold up the whole idea of whether to ideas that gets by daylight saving time\nI Know back way back in the Nineteen seventies but for some of you were even born uh they they said the reason was to save energy that if you had if you had that extra hour towards the tail end of the day if you got more daylight later he would save energy didn't saving energy\nThat there is so much consternation of both sides of that we're going to about probably set a record for a voter turnout which it would appear we are going to do at least for maternal election\nThat's that's a pretty amazing statistic we've got a moron midterms and voting at all the things that go along with it coming up next half hour\nYou're on AM nine fifty K.

I don't think he's at work everybody in on on election day in the state as big as it is [noise] um\nAnd then yesterday I went by my polling place and there was a line I vote over here in South west you stand on the line was around the building about one thirty yesterday afternoon I thought now not doing that [noise]\nSo today I I took a second swing at it aligned with a little bit shorter so I got that knocked out but but I did the stand in line I really I thought man how would you have all these people do this\nAt all and within twelve hours on your standard election day it's interesting to think that some states don't offer that of course some a lot of states are smaller than Texas of course [noise]\nUm so good for a good for you that she got out and got that done I got mine done today I got my little sticker that we're in right here and as far as daylight savings time goes that [noise] it's that what's the point I mean you tell me these days and in the modern era that we live and I would just leave the clock alone and\nJust carry through all the way 'til march I think we flip it in March April now they've changed that up to but they said it doesn't serve a life doesn't serve me\nAnd some other people really any purpose in the evening I prefer a touchy were asking earlier to have more light in the evenings to get more stuff done at work you know when you leave the office at safe sex\nOr for example it's it's already pitch dark already feels like it's ten o'clock at night so [noise] that's that's kinda my thought on that I don't I don't need it I don't need a light in the morning personally I could use it later in the evening so I'd like to leave it just where it is a day man\nThanks for the phone call and I agree with you thanks I completely agree on that uh in in this is from a guy who goes to bed early and has an easier time going to bed early if it gets dark earlier I have one of those weird body clocks if a buddy clock like this my body clock works like um I get tired\nTwo hours after local sunset whenever local since it is that's when I get tired two hours set your watch so big it's a if it gets a dark sunsets at five o'clock started to get dark seven o'clock I'll be ready for bed\nIn the summertime I struggle a little bit you know I could I usually can get to bed by eight thirty nine o'clock sometimes in the in the in the dead of summer when we get the longest days and as long as it's one let him go to bed but I don't know how people sleep for example in a place like\nAlaska or Sweden or one of these northern climates where in the wintertime they have virtually darkness most of the day in the summertime it's a flight you know or in some places even in Alaska where the sun never really sets it gets it gets down to where the sun is setting them coming back up again is never totally dark\nI don't know how you ever get used to that I guess you just you know put a window treatments to block out the sun during the summer months and you know go go do the tanning booth [laughter] in the winter months I don't know how those people are not chronically depressed\nAll right the mid term thing and I think I think days right I don't know how you could possibly hope to get everybody this year who\nWants to vote in devote if you just did it on election day there's just too many people we have over six million people do the grid the Houston area you have five and a half million people in Dallas area it's it's just it's just amazing you know you've got these population centers where it all I don't know how you would be\nGiven to get everybody into vote\nBut um it's interesting to watch how everybody's trying to handicap all this I saw Karl Rove I'm On a\nFox yesterday they were talking about midterms\nOf course everybody everybody wants to think every conservative wants to think and not one of those who wants to think that everybody's fired up\nBecause the way the Trump has been treated everybody's fired up everybody's ready to get out there and boats and certainly we're seeing huge numbers of people are turning out to vote that's a good side\nBut it seems to me there are people fired up on the other side too so Karl Rove just decided well maybe maybe we need to tamper our expectations are he's he's taken that I'm not sure this is going to turn out as well as everybody ... will approach here's what he said about the history of the midterms\nLet let's remember that it is rare that the party in power and gain seats in the house since the civil war it's happened in Nineteen thirty four Nineteen Ninety eight and two thousand and two so in all likelihood Republicans lose seats the question is how many two hundred and Eighteen is the magic number for control\nCharlie Cook says today that there are two hundred and eight seats that Lee a debtor lean likely are solid Democrat one hundred and Ninety six Republican seats in the same category and control is going to be decided by thirty one seats that are that are toss ups\nOf those thirty are held by Republicans one held by Democrats\nThat they say it's easier to when the ten for the Democrats to win ... seats out of thirty one to take control than it is for the Republicans to win twenty two out of thirty one and keep control that they can the key number for the Republicans is twenty\nThree of those thirty are incumbents in and cut let's do have a greater ability to win every one of them one last time around though Trump was losing their district Clinton was wanting that they still are one\nOkay and that's that's the way it usually\nGoes as far as the ... is going to be razor thin you know as to whether or not Republicans keep control the house of representatives but it's pretty critical if I'm if we're going to prevent\nThe Democrats from going through the impeachment process and all the other things that are going to go along with it keep turned out to vote I think I think we're finding Texas you know I'm not worried about Texas but there's plenty of other places I Am worried about\nUh Larry Joe Larry's Apatow we as a ... you probably have to be maybe a little bit of a political insider or to know who ... who is uh Larry ... is at the University of Virginia's Center for politics uh personally\nA he's a liberal and that's fine I don't think he really makes any bones about it although I Will say this about ... he makes appearances on uh all the political talk shows he makes appearances on TV all the time I've seen him on Fox I've seen him on\nCNN in this case he was on Fox and he seems to at least from the standpoint of the way he approaches things as far as doing reports or gives insights into politics he seems to do a pretty good job of playing it down in the middle\nEven though he's not personally down in the middle he seems to be able to ... separate which is getting more and more rare it used to be fairly common that you could separate your personal politics\nDuring during the winter months I mean that's awful [laughter] you end up with a really really short day I'll fall conducted where it's all about the U.S department of transportation indicated that Americans like daylight saving time because quote there is more light in the evenings therefore you could do more the survey\nWay back in Nineteen Seventy six in Australia two boys seven million citizens there they found that sixty percent prefer daylight saving time back some of them said the primary reason they liked daylight saving time is simply because people like to enjoy a long summer evening\nWhen it's still be better if you if you also had it in the winter months I I Would think you'd notice it even more in the winter months if they didn't get dark until six PM or even by thirty PM instead of or forty five or five o'clock\nJust as you're getting out of work they might be somewhat\nPositive for a lot of folks\nWho find you know getting up in the dark and going home to the dark kind of\nDepressing\nAccording to some sources daylight saving time saves energy I don't I never seen a study they\nReally showed that it really saves energy there were studies done by the U.S department of transportation and again that's who's in charge\nOf the time so that kind of all got created a back during the real world years because they were having a hard time coordinating schedules because there were no standardized times and you'd be driving in and out of the different times those all the time and and it got to be confusing\nSo that's what they did to try to fix the problem is they came up with the four different time zones than daylight savings time just kind of came off of that\n[noise] the rationale behind the Nineteen Seventy five energy saving study was that the energy use the demand for electricity for flooding homes is directly related to the times when people go to bed at night they rise in the morning\nAnd the average of twenty five percent of electricity was used for lighting and small appliances\nSuch as TVs and stereos a good percentage of energy consumed by lightning and appliances occurred in the evening when families were home so if you move the clock ahead one hour and you know like Jersey consume theoretically was supposed to decrease I don't know if it actually really did\nAnd as we got appliances and everything else that are more and more energy efficient\nI'm not so sure that that really would make a whole heck of a lot of difference anyway\nIn the winter the afternoon daylight saving time advantages offset for many people have businesses why in the mornings need for more letting\nIn the spring and the fall so it'd be kind of judge it on the around bases it really doesn't meet a whole lot\nSo the daylight savings time energy for lightning argument doesn't really hold up that much you you may save some during the darkest most of the winter you know November December January February but it balances out over the course of the year\nThe argument in favor of saving energy swayed Indiana until two thousand five only about sixty percent of the counties in India to observe daylight saving time\nThat's what's really weird to me the states that are split\nThe states that that you don't have a consistent time zone from one end of the state to the other end of the state some argue there is a public health benefit the daylight saving time\nSupposedly a decreases traffic accidents several studies and there was a Great Britain found the daylight saving time shift reduces net traffic accidents have been ... by close to one percent\nReally I Would have never thought that would have been the case\nMay be\nThere's more to it I thought that was very interesting\nResearch indicates that the district fatalities from cars sort sixty um during the weeks\nThe clock to sit back in the fall and the walkers or three times as likely to be hit and killed by cars right after the switch than in the month before daylight saving time in ...\nResearchers from Carnegie Mellon university bound to one hundred eighty six percent jump in the risk of being killed by a car where every mile walked speculate that drivers go through an adjustment period with dusk arrives earlier\nWell I think there was an adjustment period and I think that's where the argument is made for maybe what we really need to do here is um to take another look\nAt keeping the same time zone around now going back and forth keep one or keep the other keep one or keep the others the back and forth back and forth\nBut it seems to match people up now I think is sort of a nod to the fact that most people seem to prefer the daylight saving time is the fact that we've kind of expanded it\nYou know when we made that that that switch and started daylight saving time earlier in March\nWhen we made that made that switch so\nThat we ever going to come up with a consistent but that that's my argument let's pick one just pick one and then let's stick with that one alright are coming up next our ... some of the things I Want to talk about on on our number two of our program for for one thing I ... I'm going to talk about\nA subject that's really a very important to me I Know it's very very important to several personalities connected with not only ... but also Katie our age most notably Michael berry and what he does for the TST foundation um is the subject of post traumatic stress disorder\nI'm One of those people I I get really upset when I hear people tried to talk about how President Trump is creating pie TST if people if you think\nThat any anxiety you have probably the election is caused by P. T. S. D. then I don't think you know what ... is how it works how it affects people\nI don't think you know anything about it I think you're just using a term you're using the term developed everybody seems to want to use\nAlthough I must say there are some people are behaving that way you see Jim Carrey Jim Carrey the actor Jim Carrey who's gone way way less politically\nUsed to be a time or didn't know where Jim Carey was I assumed he was a liberal but I didn't know where he was I've referred to that way because I was pretty funny I mean I used to enjoy the sense of humor a but that was in that IDs and that's a long long\nTime ago I think it's become a rambling semi crazy person and he's if he does he does art for it to be seen some of his artwork that he's done to of a President Trump well here's the latest thinking you're saying about the president he said basically\n[noise]\nI wouldn't call what Trump is doing kidnapping the children although he used the term kidnapping to children he's talking about illegal aliens is what he's dog but he's talking about separating families at the border of also there's been this long before President Trump and he's accusing the president\nOf basically he's accusing him of kidnapping these kids which is about as over the top as you can get so we're going to\nGet into a whole ... thing what it is and\nWhat it is and coming up next our you're on Cape ear see here's my numbers have won three to five fifty similar three she wants to five fifty you'd like to join me here are they ... have you ever see\nA gallery furniture made in America studios this is Katie our sci fi\nSaid\n\nThousand us troops heading for the southern border how many ...
