Sheila Jackson\nLee is ah staffers have docks Lindsey Graham Orrin Hatch and Langley yeah they gave out their personal information when we're going to be at a restaurant and I conceal carry so I'm not worried about anybody there were\nVery impulse that we change our mind a lot so maybe it will go tomorrow maybe we'll catch than I\nAlready but the other reason why I Want to go there first of all I think it's cool that they did that she's putting it out there he's like Ted Cruz can eat here you're not\nNope nobody's getting chased out of this restaurant for being a Republican or a or a Democrat or a libertarian generally rice but the other thing is I checked out the menu on line it's a mid priced Italian Restaurant which I like that I don't like to overpay for dinner ...\nI Love it when you were paying I Know she does yeah yeah and a great wine selection and if I could get and if I could get my wife a little juice up before I take her home you know [laughter] for a few bottles of wine than the producer Kenya is a better night when he goes on after\nDinner that night you know something like that that wasn't working or are we going to see you tomorrow night oh really\nYou know I feel you know connection for ever read that country club I Love that place with the original die\nYeah you were okay so we got to make a cameo\nWe have to explain what's happening I I've been meaning to talk about this the whole show actually prevented egg way I I keep forgetting there's still so tomorrow night is the five year anniversary of the redneck country club here in Houston\nAnd this is kind of a big deal first of all I got engaged to my wife there I remember that and my wife was why wife was the first employee they ever had out all the billions that are performing are friends of mine captain Don marketing getting late at\nOur wedding market junction played at our wedding so that we can't miss this if you're going to be at our cc tomorrow\nCome up to me he punched me in the stomach don't do that but it's kind of come up to me and drink a cold beer with me all be ... will be posted up out on the porch all night we're going to be hanging out there it's going to be a ball I mean it's going to be a blast and it's all the original O. G. R. C. C. crude you know what I mean it's the original run their country club members\nLeads explained to those of us who are not up on the little hip kids' slang what oh gee actually mean yeah oh gee is like asking it's when you're when you're in your low rider with the with the cash popped up listening to the James Brown or maybe Rick James just\n\nRanking lawmakers and government record I don't believe it it's complete that is complete malarkey no but she was granted this kind of access I ... my opinion\nWell you know he he is he claims to be a graduate student in cyber security so he's probably very adept at hacking into things that he probably shouldn't hack into\nThis little ... name is Jack some costs go I mean I'm calling I'm a tournament assuming he's guilty we don't know yet uh but it doesn't look good for him so he recently worked for Sheila Jackson Lee he was arrested for allegedly posting the personal information or doc sing\nOf a number of senators including Lindsey Graham Mike Lee Orrin Hatch I Love Mike Lee I'm In different about the other two but but I still don't think that Lindsey Graham's personal information deserves to be out\nThere out it doesn't you know and and the Lindsey Graham ... his ...\nUm I ... I'm I'm\nI'm loving this rebate but I'm Still kind of undecided on him\nThat's exactly right yeah the new Lindsey Graham is very interesting and I don't want to say that Lindsey Graham changed because his friend passed away but that's a possibility well\nMaybe so I noticed that he started to become a little more feisty an independent when his friend stopped coming to work\nYeah you're right about that it was a change of tone for Lindsey Graham and it happened right at the same time and if it's just a coincidence fine but it's hard to believe anything is just a coincidence in Washington DC right anyway according to a sworn statement by Capitol police a witness Tuesday sock Cosco at a computer in a senator's office we're used to work a day\nAfter two other unnamed senators information of been put on Wikipedia mhm Cosco worked for other Democratic senators including Dianne Feinstein Maggie Hassan and Barbara Boxer or say just the tip of like the list of the usual suspect right right of the worst of the worst in the Democratic party\nEarlier reports identified him as an intern his lawyer said he was working as a fellow in her office paid by an outside institution\nNow I find that to be a little more believable skeptical I don't think he was an intern and ...\n... I don't think he was an intern if they if he was actually a sell out like a you know fellow at some Institute and they have to work its you feel a Jackson leaves office my question is\nWas that counted as they can\nCampaign contribution his his work\nGreat question very interesting yeah\nNobody outside paid him and he wasn't really getting you know school credit even though he's a fellow\nThat some of them so so so what is the is the tax breaks on political donations I don't think there is right yeah yeah you know get an\nEmail that you've got the reporting that you have to do to the\nFederal yeah she said that you see a ... exactly very interesting right anyway according to bell statement this was the guy from um [noise] uh from the police department over there a Capitol Hill a Cosco is alleged to have been confronted by a staffer\nAnd then walked out the staffer then called police hours later the witnesses received an email from and this is an email address live ... excuse me live free or pee on or piano W\nA pound or it it basically is from game or talk when you\nLook like owning someone yeah pound yeah I'm done with that yeah owned yeah I don't think that's how I I actually tell you something no well I kind of knew that that's what it meant but he got owned he got in China you know he absolutely\nGot on that's absolutely true so sources familiar with the case still Fox News that Cosco was\nUm in senator her son's office where he was not authorized to be and it was caught using a log and he was not authorized to use an earlier he was let go from Senator has sons off as a spokesman for senator Hassan says she strongly denounces the actions I think that's probably the right to the ...\nYeah I'm I'm actually very happy that there was another staffer who saw him where he shouldn't have been and reported it\nSo this guy had access to Social Security numbers yeah of family members of lawmakers mhm that's remarkable and health records and threatened to and threatened the docks the kids yeah\nThat he should definitely go to prison there should be an investigation into Sheila Jackson Lee there should probably be an investigation into the other senators attached to this a Barbara Boxer well she's not in office anymore okay right but we should still investigating what happened to\nYou know and it's funny Maggie his son has a has an interesting history with with\nThe interns remember a it was an intern in her office who yelled out you know an obscenity\nThat begins with an ass Trump right\nIn the Capitol rotunda yeah I and personally I it's I I think we're still investigate staffers Barbara Boxer is Harry Reid if if he worked for Harry Reid I'd seen him but yeah I mean because they're probably still around they never go away yeah I mean these people are staffers are still involved in Washington DC they are they are the swamp this is what Trump supporters\nAre talking about when they talk about\nUm the the deep state right they did you have said is a real thing and that's not conspiracy theory nonsense that is not into wars are\nTalking points on social media the deep state as a real thing it's a real problem it's the fourth branch of government these people are given access to things and they abuse their power regardless of who was in office because they have\nAccess to information and uh and and and that the regular civilians like you and I just don't have to try yeah anyway it's scary it's frightening and I don't I don't the worst part about the Sandra is I don't think that this was the last we've seen a bus we keep hearing stories\nAbout people on the left attacking people on the right we keep hearing stories about Maxine Waters encourages their constituents to go after conservatives\nAre him and then people are surprised what Steve ... get shots right or or or what happened to Rand Paul or or what was the latest one I mean the stuff happens all the\nWell yeah I mean Rand Paul was was I'm not physically attacked but certainly intimidated in in the airport\nRand Paul was physically attacked by his neighbor who appears managed dream left us right and and by and broke six ribs and by the way it earlier this week that Ted Cruz's office of the people pretty much forgotten our earlier\nToday emergency crews were sent out to three greenway plaza this is fifty nine and a buffalo speedway right and well that's right where Ted Cruz's officers that into investigate another suspicious\nPackage ... this happen again today in Houston to\nClear out an office building employees were evacuated from the Twenty one story building it's right in the same area right if this was a coincidence I don't believe it\nYou know I don't I don't believe that there are some some companies in that area but I\nDon't know yeah people were told they couldn't go back and isn't it weird that it happened right by Ted Cruz's office again\nMm how does this keep happening\nI I don't know I mean the other day when it happened to Ted Cruz my office is just at Caribbean fifty nine and and for two solid hours it was nothing but sirens\nRight it's times like this that we need liberty and truth and freedom more than ever I mean this is the reason why we do what we do I always tell people you know if if you're concerned about the troops getting out there if you're concerned about your own freedom and your own safety ... joined the liberty movement you don't have to join the Libertarian Party joined the liberty movement\nYeah I mean it's just the whole point is you should be responsible for yourself and not and not have anybody else really telling you what to do\nI protect my house or the shock on you know I mean if we have to call the police fine but I'm not worried about them getting there and and I and I'm sure a lot of these conservative lawmakers are the same way with\nFamilies you know and as a as a single woman yes I'd take my self protection very seriously\nAs you should ... as you should Sandy you live in a really nice part of the city you live in a very very safe little community and I still worry about you 'cause you're my friend\nRight yes even though I have a large well trained German Shepherd yes to do around with me\nNot a golden retriever now [laughter] I'm Kevin extra junior phone lines are up and we're here for one more hour whether you watch it on our um our caller

Martin you're calling for Congress what's on your mind sir\nAnd know how to fix the healthcare system in America\nWhoa that is a doozy do do you just said a mouthful are you sure you're up for this\nYeah OK here's what you do All right all veterans discharge veterans instead of using the VA hospital or my choice which doesn't work\nNot to use the same health care is the congressman memorial get labeled now\nRegardless of what people think veterans nuts it around going on today go to topless Fargo da da da da da da da da da da\nSilva ... for low income the crowd that emergency grades which is the most expensive health or there is they go to the hospital for all of them still keep their jobs and I think ... probably doing research on this and there's probably about as many\nVeterans that there are eleven million people here illegally plus the other twenty to thirty million who can't afford healthcare\nYeah there there are about twenty million veterans from World war two to the present that yes they are the health\nCare system six now it's too simple to Congress will probably never do it and I'm the guy you get a T shirt came to the comedy show when the capital guys running late that the five minutes and twenty percent then diesel Seventy percent\nOf the sister ... percent mutt [laughter] I Love the camp hope guys and we throw comedy shows for them and usually there on time but sometimes they run a few minutes late in their defense they have to get a big bus full of people and carry him across this on I'm\nNot I'm not criticizing oh I Know you're not I know you're not I was just\nExplaining what he meant by that to the listeners what you meant that's all I wanted and they had the\nThe little old lady there that look like your grandma because like a sailor she was still\nThere Oh yes absolutely I we have any we have an interesting group all listeners it's a it's a diverse crowd of young and old but one thing they have in common is they like really dark comedy\nAnd some of 'em do tend to swear like a sailor when you get a couple of beers and I'm not no no judgment though nothing wrong with that Martin I like your idea I think it's an interesting idea or the left will never go for it\nI don't know it takes care of older people\n[laughter] yeah I could see why you would say that Martin I think um you know that this is the thing\nThat I always go back to when we're talking about health care the ... the people on the laughter status and not everyone on the right as a state as some people on the writer status\nBut not everyone has the right has libertarians there's no libertarians on the left virtually none some have argued that Gary Johnson is a left leaning libertarian\nFine I but he but most people are not Gary Johnson libertarians and most leftists are not libertarian or not Gary Johnson advocates either but I don't want to get off subject here\nThe thing I always talk about when I talk about health care is these people that want more government healthcare solutions seem to misunderstand that the government has ran healthcare for one very specific group of people roughly one percent of society\nFor years and years and years and years and years how long has the existed since since before World War two um no I think it was probably right in right after that's what I thought yeah it's right around the time we got the department of defense the DOT so the severe department the D O D and basically the ... the military complex\nMatter of fact the veterans was not elevated take cabinet level position and kill either\nCarter Reagan\nAnd the VA has been a minute later than that might have been later in the VA has been a mess for as long as anybody can remember it's it's a complete tragedy and yet somehow we know for a fact that the government can't handle the health care\nAnd people on the left it says we have more of this terrible government help their solution I'm Ken Webster junior open

Martin who was a smart dude I think Martin at some interesting things to say and he had clearly thought very deeply about how we can fix the healthcare system in this country and\nI like what he said I Would have added a couple of things to his idea like for example let's just start with this one of the problems with Obamacare is that you can't buy health insurance from outside of your state mountain you know what\nHappens when you have more options what happens to the price the price goes down yeah so obviously that would be great right\nWell I I'm going to go even more radical than this ... why don't we just get rid of the whole notion that we need health health insurance and the first place and let the market determine the price for each good in service\nSome people are probably very disturbed by what you just said I'm sure they are but I Would remind them of this are dental ... health system in this country basically dental insurance exists but it doesn't have the same kind of control over the market\nThe way that the government and the way that our health care of the way that had health insurance and ... and what and what is the big difference between having your teeth worked on and go into a doctor's office in terms of price a lot a lot of the difference right I could pay out of pocket for my for my dentist I Can't pay out of pocket to go to the doctor's office you'd have to be a millionaire many times over to be able to do that\nWell I've got some friends who who are actually making a conscious decision to not have health insurance and and they will go through when they have to have tests done and things like that they will go through and find a provider that that provides then the the lowest price in at the quality level that they're willing to pay for\nI Am not being paid to say this I'm not a paid spokesperson for liberty share but I like liberty sure ... I found out from about liberty sharp from one of our listeners yes very bright lady you can you can save a lot of money if you go with one of these alternatives to all these the hearing here's the only catch they're not going to cover you\nIf you have like a drug overdose or if you get into a shootout if you do something illegal something immoral something on Christian causes you to have health consequences it's not going to cover that\nAnd I think that's really the only catch and that's not really much of a catch\nFor most of our listeners who are who are not going to get into a gang shootout this weekend or overdose on ... you know what I mean\nWhen we would hope yeah anyway we we got on the health care things that somebody called in about it it's First Amendment friday on pursuit of happiness radio which is the which is feeling and right now for the Jimmy ... so anybody could call about anything and if you want to call seven when three two one two five nine five zero is the number I'll say it again it's Seventy one three two one two five\nTo the current I make sure that would be up to the veterinarian to give discounts to who they want to\nGet one over someone over sixty five they get a discount blah blah\nBut what I Would not even work how do you prove that you're a social justice where oh hey I burn a flag last month aren't even title to a discounted at Denny's yeah I guess you're right you want to discount for that hey I I'm not the garbage can over and I rioted at the Donald Trump inauguration don't get a discount on\nBeer no you don't because you're an idiot here's your card to me a break dude ad gets it and what do you do live in man\nFirst your company have forty years and don't ask me why I guess I Love it I actually do I like building thing what I was a kid my brother and I would go out in the woods and\nCut down trees and build a like a little houses you know and stuff and\nI like that and I like what you do and I want to ask you a question and you can answer as honestly as you want I'm not asking you to attack Donald Trump but how do you feel about this tariff war thing it's kind of winding down now but it still affects our relationship with China and and while it's while it's cooled off with Mexico and Canada\nHas that affected your industry at all they say that the steel and iron workers are really affected by this tariff war has it has it have you felt that it on the\nShow or something like that may affect us but it's I mean it just happened last year allow or something like that but I don't see it\nInteresting yeah you're right I've I've said this myself it's not what I Would do if I was president but\nTrump won the election and he seems to have gotten his way with Mexico and Canada I mean I I was very critical of that was I not Sandy you work and and now and now we've got better trade deals with Mexico and Canada so I'm not it's not what I Would have done but it seems to be working at your you know\nChina need more than we need because what if we just plan that all of their shape goods that come over here all the time\nYeah well well go ahead and there would be disruption in the market but eventually it would work its way out yeah well put\nAt at from magnolia at your obviously smart guy called back the show anytime you want I Love hearing from your\nOdd to the rest of you we only got two segments left our time is not done here today don't be shy calling us right now I Will talk about anything in the news anything Texas related anything having to do with barbecue brisket her country music give us a ring right now seven on three two one two five nine five zero pursuit of happiness radio filling in for Jimmy beret\nListen to Jimmy at work [noise] just say oh look so please keep your ... radio\nNo more ferrets show\nYes we ... we had to play this guy didn't wait\nI grew up on this music man [noise] I grew up on Dr drain Snoop Dogg and I'm a child of the nineties in the eighties so hold it against me don't judge me people but this isn't [noise] which is not what we expect to be here in the news this week I mean I guess if you've been following this story you kinda knew this was going to happen some foreign\nRap mogul Marion showed the night shift night is his name\nIs going away to prison for a very long time by by should kill somebody yeah okay yeah so it shouldn't surprise anybody now he has been sentenced to twenty eight years in prison Thursday for the death of a man during a hit and run incident I'm a set of the movie straight ... Compton oh wow yeah\nRight like that movie came out a while ago and we're not even talking about four years ago yeah ... exactly that's exactly right he's fifty three years old he pleaded no contest to manslaughter earlier this month a connection with the death of carry card or have you seen the video\nThat's yes it is it is rough it is hard to watch all man the former death row records cofounder had been facing life in prison for Carter's death\nAnd one count of attempted murder in the case of clay bones Sloane ... bone is I don't think bonuses Christian and probably not no probably not he was named after night allegedly struck the pair with a truck G ...\nA night had it that's the video yeah it's hard to watch the video he hit some yeah and then he backs that up\nAnd then he goes after him again is like that dentist lady who ran over her\nHead and and I don't know if I can imagine that but when I watched the video I feel like I can hear the bones crack at it you know like I'm Sorry that I don't like when I lecture you know like when I Know when I'm ... sound effects [laughter] with a problem and I had been charged with one count of a hit and run should night is charged with murder\nIn the hit and run case a video of the incident showed the truck driven by night pulling into the entrance of Compton restaurant near the site where the movie was being filmed in twenty Fifteen three years ago\nThis has been going on for a while do you remember when snoop dog was on trial for murder do you remember that oh that's a long time ago murder was the I think murder did he make the song murder was the case that he gave me before or after that Josh you remember I don't know either it it made it made the song infinitely more poverty and of course\nPeople at the time in much the same way that they were defending OJ we're trying to defend Snoop Dogg\nNow looking back on that in history it's pretty obvious O. J. Simpson murdered his wife and and run ... so do you think the public's perception of Snoop Dogg in that instance changed at all I'm probably not Snoop Dogg recently went after Kanye West for being pro Trump for being a magic guy wearing the magma hat\nAnd I and he had told them he said make your music great again is what Snoop Dogg said the ... and ... and as I was reading that the first thing I thought I was like look I'm not a rapid fishy an auto I don't understand everything happening down the hall on Ninety three point seven to beat but I'm pretty sure Snoop Dogg is older and has not had any hit\nSongs as recently as a cousin county has right um and then and then it's similarly I think it's possible that you know Snoop Dogg\nAccused of murdering someone maybe you shouldn't judge Carney for being public as a new dog\nWasn't really doing much music that we're spending more time on reality shows\nA dry says killing happened three months before his album came out so just good timing for a really good time there was just great that was good publicity and I'm sure you know what's weird is I mean that that's probably how they marketed it it probably helps ...\nYou're right because that was it was left first\nRally you know they got a bunch of lemon so they had to make lemonade let's market the album this way\nIn the mid nineties it was a very violent time for hip hop fast forward to Tony Eighteen and it's a bunch of white kids with face tattoos rapping about how they like\nTo take drugs while they go to festivals that like that Mac Morris or ... while he was kind of starting to get into the CIA okay and then the more\nRecent ones you've got ... what is what is the oil wells and as a person [laughter]\nI think I'd go for years and he raps about how he likes to take a opiates and that was a on a short for Xanax than they have set to stick to that is like\nJim and yeah that's what my kids to look up to that yeah absolutely any and okay well it's funny you bring that up\nHis girlfriend I think is no osiris which is my little sister now there are men and women and their concern what are you trying to tell me Josh broke up okay I Know it's good to know where they came here see news radio Houston, Texas will keep you abreast of all the latest information\nOn the love affair between Miller Cyrus and will then number one for a little in related news and also a conservative leaning political information who else has got\nThat but I came to the radio they it's our this is our gift to the community I Know that no need to thank God don't send me any gift baskets\nAnyway ... certainly not kill the guy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jimmy Barrett", "city": "Houston", "day": "05"}
