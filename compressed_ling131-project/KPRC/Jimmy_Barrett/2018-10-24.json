Fox has kind of a lefty isn't he\nYeah he is kind of a lefty um you know but he was very good at playing characters\nDid you hear with Peter from Crosby set in the last segment about how they skin so for those are just tuning in we had a caller in the last segment and pay Peter cool guy talks talks to us on social media sometimes and stuff like that and he had a weird experience where he gave them his um ... was it his ah his ca ca\nCa yeah right I think at the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago exactly the same thing\nSo they stand a card they stop and his his uh his a commercial was that his commercial driver's license or his his uh uh a concealed handgun winding there yeah can you hear me\nOn all of a sudden you you went out but yeah the exact\nSame interacting I\nKnow you're there obviously right so they scan one ID and it and it goes into a database for a different kind of a IDs you could use your commercial driver's license you can use your concealed handgun license your license to carry you can use your uh you know you can pretty much use any\nGovernment are distributed or ID card to vote right and and so that's kinda what's crazy by the way that brings up a great point\nPeople are mad that we have voter ID laws of Texas do you realize how many different kinds of things qualify as a voter id there's a lot seven\nYet because he can use your military id is your passport yeah I Would\nI Would love to know if anybody else out there as having problems like Sandy did a remote like Peter did excuse me give us a call ... won three two one two five nine five zero\nSyndrome are you are you coming in and doing a live in Studio with me this Friday you're going to be your First Amendment friday I Am what's going on on the docket you write anything interesting for the readers people have been asking me\nI'm working on a piece all you know something that happened at the Trump rally on Monday that nobody's talking about and yet the few outlets that are covering it are casting it in in a way that I'm kind of makes you you know really questioned the value of the journalism that we've got\nTo give us a little just a little hint before you release the article\nYeah yeah Trump Trump was talking about uh ten percent middle class tax cut ah\nYeah absolutely at the rally and nobody picked\nThis except for a couple of outlet in just like I said the way they're spending it is pretty interesting\nIn defense of the of the media and you never hear me say that Trump said a lot at that rally you could write an article out of everything you said\nAll right but I I think that and now something at a policy position that's a bold policy position right there\nTotally down with ten percent\nA tax cuts for the middle class the question is would it be that sweet of a slice of the pie if we don't get a reduction in spending from the government at the same time\nYeah I mean you and I are going to go on on that and and that that was another thing that we could go trapped in a cabinet had to cut their department budget five percent\nRight on yeah I hear anything about\nThat what we we talked about it on the show and we talked about it online and yeah you didn't hear much else you didn't hear much else from the mainstream media 'cause they were more interested in Michael ...

far between the woodland spring a double your I Am doing my thing and we're talking a lot to be so far this morning about their this afternoon rather simple used in the mornings I keep seeing mornings he was afternoon here by the way\nIs it raining yet you see this is this is\nBeginning this is beginning to get me upset I shouldn't I shouldn't be upset about people's inability to forecast the weather\nBut it seems to me that our meteorologist you're just they're not very good at forecasting the weather\nYou know we're seeing all morning that they were supposed to get a couple of hours in the morning and we're supposed to have a steady soaking rain in the afternoon and as the time I came up your beer for the show to thirty we we had maybe ... where's the soaking rains\nWhere where's the remnants of will look I mean I don't care that we don't get a whole bunch of rain and that's what's gonna happen or if it's delayed what's going on some it's amazing to be wholly inaccurate could be anyway\nWe're talking about the uh the pipe bombs that were sent to former President Obama a center George Soros said to Hillary Clinton a and a laundry list of others they had to return address for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nWhile we don't know is how dangerous they actually were if they were designed to get attention or if they were actually designed to kill or maim\nAnd of course what we do know is who sent them and what their motivation is although that's not stopping a lot of people from speculating on one side or another as to who or what the costs could be\nA joined us to talk about that whole broad have other issues especially around the border right now for Breitbart Texas Bob rice so Bob I guess it's the same old story at least in the early hours of this one but we don't know far surpasses what we do know\nWell and that's pretty typical at this point on the investigation and good afternoon by the way it's still high and dry over here on my side of down to\nSee what's going on with the rain anyway\n[laughter] hey ... weather forecasting the only job where you can be wrong Ninety percent of the time just to keep your job\nIt's true it's true um I thought it was interesting that the only person so far that seemed to have been an adult and all this and the reaction to it is President Trump ironically enough\nWho basically said there's no excuse for this that there is um that we all need to do to pull together on this one that will be a complete and thorough investigation we're going to get to the bottom of it going to thing while everybody else including Jeff Zucker\nA at CNN is saying there was a total lack of understanding of the White House about their continued attacks on the media you know the words he's saying it's President Trump will that this has happened well\nSeveral people are saying that and even Senator Jeff flake or came out and\nSaid that that the president must denounced the lock her up chants\nAt the rallies although I've heard that they're going to change those chats struck lock her up to hold her up for the next election [noise] a\nTheory ... what are you hearing from uh your um your co workers at Breitbart who don't have any working theories about who or what it is we're looking for in connection with is\nNo not really be and if you know I I covered the Austin bombing 'em\nPretty extensively when that was going on earlier this year but one of the things we figured out real quick is is not to speculate on who it might be or what their motivation might beach because\nYou're probably going to be wrong at this point and you know it remains to be determined yeah everybody's trying to buy that I'm trying to provide without some right wing conservative and uh we've had those kinds of things before it\nActually came down to it it was somebody from the left wing so we shall see how this this bears out the facts come out will will point the facts as they happen and no fake news here kind of thing and you know let's be accurate was what we're talking about\nIs gonna be interesting to see um how long it takes you know the uh the post office and certainly the congressional mail room has gotten to the point where they're pretty sophisticated when it comes to trying to trace back where this stuff is coming from\nYeah they really are and or if they can track it back to a drop off the location and get some video which is how they ended up catching the Austin bomber is they they got him on video dropping off packages\nAt the beach at the um mailboxes a or UPS Store whichever one it was I forget I think there's UPS Store you know I think you're right\nAnd uh and then they were able to track back\nHis receipts to Home Depot where they found that worry purchased everything and um got his cell number and tracked him down to a location on the highway and these play took him into custody and when\nYou get down to ... price it's it's really I mean when you get right down to it rhetoric aside and I and I understand you know what people are saying on the left in the right about the rhetoric and how we shouldn't really be surprised if something like this has happened because everybody's gotten completely out of whack and we can't seem to talk to each other in a civil tone anymore but we get right down to it\nYou know for for somebody who regardless of what their politics are\nAre you are not to you know playing with a full deck of cards um ... we I don't know how we ... we can all feel for for rhetoric when rhetoric doesn't take a person like you or me or or somebody who's semi level headed and take them to the point of wanting to build a pipe bomb and mail it\nYeah and apparently some of these pipe bombs were pretty sophisticated and how they were put together so there\nThere is some um some technology involved in this thing and it will be interesting to see how it plays out the rhetoric you know a everybody wants to buy the radical rhetoric now but when tops were being shelled and and twenty six change\nAnd ah the black lives matter were out there chanting off the pigs and pigs in a blanket find like bacon\nAnd bang bang going going and things like that nobody see on the left St upset about that rhetoric and police officers being shelled so\nIt'd be nice if both sides that dollar rhetoric back a little bit let's have some several conversations looked at a lot of important work to do in this country including getting our border security on the southern side of this country and um yeah flick it helps you civil discussions about how we might actually get something done\nYou know well wouldn't that be something that we could get Congress's who'd done actually considered doing something about it I I'm not sure of what is going to take a price for that to happen any thoughts from your end as far as what it would take in order for Democrats actually want to act on immigration\nLaw at some point the Hispanic community is going to get tired of the pandering that's been going on for over a decade from the left\nYou know they could have solved this problem during the first two years of the Obama administration without a single Republican vote and uh and they didn't do it they kept putting it off and putting it off and now in the in the last year when when President Trump actually offered them more than what they were asking for ...\nThey wouldn't come to the table because they didn't that the issue is more important to them than finding a solution they want the issue as an election wedge that drive people apart and and or Hispanics that I talk to you know there are many Hispanics\nAt the Trump rally on Monday in Houston and and they all fully supports the president's program says plans as a desire to secure the border his desire to fix immigration and sensible way and you see that support out there very strongly in that community\nAnd will you take a look at how historically low interest rates have been and how high credit card rates have been a you can see that it's tough to make headway you didn't pay those bills off to give apple equity in your home you can still write off your\nYour home mortgage interest why not do it that we pay off the credit cards tear them up and get to the world of debt free living see once you get the credit cards done and then you can concentrate on getting off the house\nAnd chicken or

four thirty three hundred is website is streamlined approval dot com that streamlined approval dot com\nOr with Breitbart Texas Bob prices with us You're on AM night fifty K. P. or seen we're talking about the care of and\nAnd the optics of the care but at this point and um it's always interesting to me the way certain media outlets\nIt's the cover these kinds of stories most of them at least most of the mainstream likes to make sure you see a lot of video of moms and their kids you know so 'cause he can still get the heartstrings a little bit but they don't show you who else is important here man do they\nDie they really don't and you know we've we've seen that I've seen a lot of\nPhotos from down there and the majority of this particular group of people appears to be young young men who are looking for jobs not looking for a\nRefugee status in the end you know that's the difference even even the women that have been interviewed a I saw CNN interview the other day and age where the first thing they say is we can't get work down there we need to come up here so we can make money well that's not what refugee status as about\nAnd you know the White House I was a conference call yesterday with a with them and they were talking about how when they change the asylum require much from a credible fear to the un standard on torture\nAll of a sudden the claims coming across the border changed to match that\nChange in policy so they they're being coached along the way it is right up to the point\nWhere they get ready to cross the border there being coached on what to say in order to\nAt least cleared the initial refugee interview process so that they can get into the\nSystem and of course wants to get into the system they get released a with that application notice to appear to immigration court near their destination and history shows that Ninety percent of them never show for immigration court\nWell and part of the problem is how long it takes you know the the rest do appear in court months later [laughter] you know in the ... disappeared into the into the woodwork and or you know they're they're part of the underground economy\nYeah it takes now they if you take about\nThree or four days worth of border crossings at the current rate of people crossing the border it takes an entire year of the federal process for immigration to hold the hearings and have a an actual court appearance on that two or three days was across states so that's how far behind were getting in this whole process\nNow supposedly one of the things the president is talking about addition to the possibilities of the troops down to the border to process these people and to hopefully turn them around and send them back although they've really seems to happen no matter what\nI'm One of the other things he's talking about doing is expediting some of these court cases and getting more immigration judges involved\nWe have the old days you do that and if we do have you believe you do with why haven't we done it before\nWe have been doing that actually the or the Congress has authorized some funds in those slashed a spending authorization I ... I Would say budget but we don't do budgets anymore I'm so they put it in spending authorization to move a lot of the immigration judges to the border areas where they can try to get\nSome of these cases resolved more quickly but the rate of of gross of the number of people crossing is just too high but we saw an eighty percent increase in family and that's what\nThe border so called family unit aliens crossing the border between July and the end of September at the end of the fiscal year than eighty percent increase in what was already a very high number so there's just no way that anybody can keep up with that short of um you know turning\nTens of thousands of people in the immigration judges and sending them down there to the border\nWe're talking about price for Breitbart Texas Iranian life it became clear see is the answer to the wall with will solve the problem or ... or dissolution\nThere's ... there's two issues here the the first issue as we need the wall for security purposes we need to stop the flow of drugs we need to stop terrorists from being able to people from terrorists countries from being able to cross over the border and we need to make it more difficult for anyone else to cross the border but these people right now that are\nCrossing the border and looking for the first border patrol agent that they can find or first police officer that they can find just turn themselves in\nA walls not going to stop that process because they're they're going to they're ... they want to get captured\nAnd so what the solution to that problem is is that Congress needs to take the Central American migrants and treat them the same way they treat Mexican migrants then that is if you show up you get sent back\nRight now the law provides that they get to apply for this process and have a hearing and all of that which is different than the way we treat Mexican nationals so why not treat all of those people exactly the same way\nAnd repatriate them back to their country of origin immediately that would stop the problem in a heartbeat\nWow okay so why do you think we haven't done that yet\nBecause Democrats Walt I'm won't even consider something like that\nThey was going to require what they require some congressional action in order to make that happen\nAbsolutely it's going to require Republicans in Congress saying we don't care what you're saying that this is what we're gonna do pass it out of the house get it to the Senate and then um\nTry to find a way to get you know fifty one votes out of the stuff that which is a very difficult things and unfortunately this you have to get sixty votes or which is almost impossible to and that's one of the road like comes at but there's ways to put it in there in in a\nAs amendments to other

over there at NBC is a lot easier to offend\nThan the staff at Fox News was she was doing a piece on a on universities like the University of Texas which make recommendations to their fraternities and sororities about Halloween parties and what appropriate and inappropriate costumes are\nBecause after all we don't want anybody's feelings to get hurt\nNow there are some costumes\nThat you would think would be no brainer that even I Would say okay I can see why that might be offensive there are other ones that might be a little bit on the borderline they might be a little risque for example but that they're not they really should be considered offensive\nAnd then there's ones that are considered offensive by the university that you wouldn't dream of a million years would be

[noise] All right back to um\nFrom the University of Texas this is just voluntary this is we're not we're not requiring anybody to follow these rules\nWe just want people to understand that we don't want a bunch of students running around being offended\nSo they put all these guidelines together now what you need to do\nAs a fraternity or sorority at the University of Texas in order to be able to have a successful Halloween experience without upsetting the snowflakes so what is their plan\nTo close them\nIf you're afraid of someone's reaction than you probably shouldn't do it's\nConsidered consulting with our organization is national office or universities staffing advanced we understand that we're responsible for the team are attendees participation and our personal costumes\nIf we are on concerned about the potential for negative reactions and choose not to take these considerations seriously we are fully prepared to deal with the consequences\nAre huh it a mandatory but it's pretty clear that if you are breaking their guidelines\nSomebody's going to notice and there will be repercussions so\nAnd they made any specific suggestions or guidelines about what you can or can't be in the answer's yes yes they have they don't want any harmful themes are costumes\nAnd here's what they say anytime you paint or to ensure skin in an attempt to appear to be a different skin tone race or culture that's harmful so if you want to be\nA Indian\nNow with a feather with a dog\nYou want to be in India and then you try to make your skin tone look a little bit more authentic that would be wrong\nIf you want to be Diana Ross and you want your face to be closer to being that of an African American that would be wrong no matter how your otherwise portraying that person any attempt to change the color or tone of your skin is unacceptable\n\nWhich I guess means every time most do you ladies put makeup on you're doing something that would be in the eyes of\nThe guidelines at the University of Texas might not be the right thing to do here's all what's also on the list generalize representation stereotypes of Asian cultures oh yup you can be Asian if you're not Asian that would be cultural misappropriation\nCowboys and Indians nope can't do that that's right you shouldn't dress up like a cowboy\nHang on let me make sure I understand this at the University of Texas in Texas where cowboys were basically created you you you can't be a cowboy\n\nOkay what's offensive ... boots is it the hat\nIs the spurs is the chaps\nMust be the gun you give me a cowboy without having a gun\nBut something tells me that's an okay either I'm a no\nGeneralized depiction of an indigenous person or people's so do not try to be an Indian Native American if you will or here in Texas I assume don't try to be Mexican or Hispanic unless you are or know gypsies\nNo gay shows no south of the border or fiesta yep\nYou were in that blanket than some world that could really really upset somebody know being a Hawaiian know tropical no late that's like camp where a flower lay around your neck because you were attempting to portray yourself as hang on his second\nHave you ever been to Hawaii I've been lucky enough to have been to why they gave you a lay when you get off the plane at the airport and they didn't ask me if I was a Hawaiian they just put it around my neck and welcome to the islands\nI Wonder if they realize that what they're doing over there is wrong welcoming tourists like that no ghetto fabulous while I get that one\nNo urban know\nGita up\nNope incident hose no golf pros and tennis does is as the months I think that was the theme was I don't know if anybody does a more know being a trophy wife nope\nNo uh no no no trailer trash no white trash no hold those soldiers Gabby hobo because of ... a hobo is\nJust you know it's it's it's it's it's just a homeless person that you're making fun of no checks and Hicks no rednecks now aren't you happy to know if you're a redneck that the University of Texas has even tried to protect you they are determined\n\nBy the way if you ever seen the board game redneck life\nUm check that out\nI'm not really big into board games but that is one of the funniest dog on the games I've ever seen skull redneck life my sister got me a copy of that is amazing so those are all the things that you can't be\nThat didn't that eliminates a lot of categories now here the things they want you to consider instead\nFirst of all they want to want to warn you yet again that simulates harmless things can be carried out incorrectly if you don't provide information about costuming\nAlways fully consider your entire social theme and guess expectations in other words if you pick a country western theme for example but if the guests arrived is\nA you know red dye eggs then you didn't do your job so if you're I have a country western thing but the frat house you better define what's allowed and what isn't allowed\nOnly moly\nSo here's some of the suggestions they have four themes a time period decades like the nineties the sixties the early to thousands\nYou might want to stay away however from the seventies and the reason why I say that did you hear about Kendall Jenner did you hear about what she did well somewhat shaded is what the folks at vogue magazine did\nYeah\nThe folks at at at vogue magazine evidently we're kind of working with a little things with their own\nAnd\nLet me find that somebody Houston morning news blog there it is and they had heard dressed up\nThey\nWere kind of doing sort of a a Gibson Girl kind of an ad you'd have to look that up historically it's got to look for like the uh the turn of the past century not this century the last century but the surgery
