I'm from Chicago more nine times out of town I defend the cops I'll just you know you don't know well well yeah I have\nLived here for years but nine times out of town I defend the cops John but but I'm at Tempe time I just want to say bad top students as just like that I'm just like bad plumbers exist and there are cases like that ah sixteen times to shoot a guy I I find that to be a little weird but\nI I haven't I haven't looked at the facts of bad taste recently I've been to a Texas politics the news lately I'll see if I could do something on that tomorrow anyway I I Do appreciate the call John and here's a call from Nick Nick what's on your mind sir\nI'm thinking of consequences intended consequences unintended consequences but it's the cabinet say we know the Democrats and the consequences to get cabin on not nominated or you know not on the Supreme Court right [noise]\nUm the me too I mean we know the immediate consequences to stop assaults or rape or so why didn't we didn't we they\nEnd up making stronger family units bringing families back together and lowering S T e great um I saw me and my Facebook of remember the state that wanted to do a consensual thing before people would like go to parties you have you have a signing\nOaks in California and they act in California yeah in California they have a weird while they're they have a couple of weird laws but in California one of the things are trying to do\nIs get people to sign a consent document before they have such which is weird because that means there's a possibility that you could date someone and she could pull out of filing cabinet full ... thousands of documents and you'd have to wonder like whoa that's a lot of paperwork\nHey do and then the second thought would be do you want to know someone in here could I review some of the papers just to see oh you oh my brother in law's in here you know so it is a little strange they have another weird long California and this is a very\nTechnical law that some people might some at some point this this law might get in front of the Supreme Court they belong California about penetration and what it says is that if two people are drunk and they have sex for the first time and they didn't know each other before this\nWhoever was to penetrate or which by default biologically always has to be the men right that that person is guilty of sexual assault and this is a weird thing to think because first of all the last sort of implies that adults\nWho have had a couple of drinks can't legally consent to something and then there's all kinds of gray areas on that like what if they vaguely knew each other for a while\nAnd then one night they hooked up at an office party like again these we were making fun of Austin and all the weird laws there earlier it seems like one of those strange laws that could very rarely being forced but once in a while once in a blue moon in an extreme situation that could get somebody into some trouble ... what were you going to say about that next\nLowering abortion rights right and so it ends up taking money away from Planned Parenthood they're they're trying to get people in trouble and what if it actually had a positive effect with everybody being scared it will go the opposite direction that we kind of what they\nHad intended it would have been ... on it and the acquaintance or [noise]\nOr you know single mothers is is a typical your vote for Democrats right because they need a system thought if that makes people scared to have sex out of wedlock that it actually raises the marriage rate and\nLess dependency on the government which in turn take away votes from the Democrat it could be like a shoot themselves what kind of thing in a in a weird weird has kind of going down a rabbit hole that was actually the mean that I thought it was what you had explained to the\nCalifornia thing and it's still running around me thinking down that like or you know sit on a third of the what if the driver with a good outcome too and they you know they end up taking money out of their own pocket\nYou raised that you raised a lot of great points here to some people listening to you you did go down a rabbit hole but don't feel bad dude I Do that all the time especially\nOn our on the same way with the ex\nEspecially on Wikipedia and YouTube I'll fall into a rabbit hole but in this case you're asking an important question what are the unintended consequences what are the unintended consequences if anything the federal government does the state government municipal government local laws that sort of thing like I was thinking about this the other day what would be the unintended consequences\nOf having capital punishment for pedophiles for child rapist All right well on one hand\nThis this would put up a stern message out there that were against pedophiles but on the other hand would this cause pedophiles to murder their victims I mean it's that kind of like an extreme example of an unintended consequences but you know you have to ask questions like I I'm not trying to answer that question right on the air but I Do like that you're asking that question next\nAnd or anybody else that's been on hold right now I Apologize we about this is this includes the pursuit of happiness radio for today however now I'm ramping it up here

H A leather belt off and tell me I've got a choice I can\n\nGet it on the other one is that I Know I hate it back on but got it the last time out every lever\n... it was so bad he probably sit next to dad go ahead and hit me with that belt late April I'd have to like yeah absolutely I I buy food you'll love the most\nGreg that if you if you could eat it every day for the foreseeable future if you had to\nUh it'd be hard to pull it down to one thing but I Would say if it was barbecued I could probably take it out\nOh yeah anything specific [noise]\nUh not really I Love I Love pork chops I Love ribs I Love British get I mean I ... as long as it's on the grill I can handle it\nOkay that's a pretty wide you know that's a pretty smart move and you were part political wide category like that anything that's made on the grill because that that could you could make just about anything on the grill dry\nAbsolutely moms are can ever wake you up\nThere you go Greg thank you so much Greg Pasadena Caitlin that's a great thank you that's a great contribution liver and onions\nOh my God that's awful [noise] like I said my mother used my mother used my mother used to love\nLiver and onions and you could smell it cooking in the kitchen and it doesn't smell particularly good as you could imagine I mean you're you're cook it up\nIn Oregon for goodness sakes I think about what the liver does now my wife she'll she loves chicken livers\nLet's just as bad but you know\nShe'll eat those things up if she gets a chance I I don't I don't understand\nThere's gotta be something wrong with your taste buds to be able to eat liver and onions I mean there's there's gotta be something fundamentally different I Want to know why liver for people who like liver and onions I'd want to know why that tastes good to you and I and I can't even smell it\nThere's gotta be something very very different about our DNA\nOh by the way I thought a one more food that I I Love enough and you could probably very enough\nTo ah to do stuff like you to get every day how about tacos how 'bout tacos you could that be tacos chicken tacos a corn tortillas flour tortillas you could have shrimp tacos fish tacos\nDo you ... your breakfast tacos you\nWould scrambled eggs and sausage and we'll talk with these very nice thank you very much now for some people live with their well that's not\nReally a taco yeah it's you know in Texas ... ... you put it in a tortilla shell it's a taco I mean that's the main thing just don't put it in a hard shell right\nInto everything spied on that goes up the tacos is not a bad place that's not a bad place to go or some of the other um items by the way that ended up on the list um\nThe last bite of a hot dog\nWhat's wrong with the last ... with the hot dog if you liked it enough to get the last last bite\n... what what could be wrong with it Hawaiian pizza made it all is well\nI I'd have to say that you're not a big fan of putting food on top of pizza but you know it's pizza so I could I could make it work the corner piece of a brownie\nYou want to talk about specific the corner these this the one that's kind of crunchy that's the one that even if they in order to get the brownies done in the middle right around the edges they're a little bit maybe on the burn side\nSo that that made the list like I said they got real specific on this salon throw one state hates the lunch room who is that Mississippi Mississippi did do well as the longer for some reason\nPlease note that you probably have a hard time finding salon drove Mississippi\n[noise] um\nChili peppers made the list quinoa yeah I'm not a big fan of quinoa capers\n\nCapers huh that's not really isn't it more like a garnish that's not really like a meal I mean you're not going to make a meal out of capers or you don't think so um the um some\nMade the list uh like I said a chick fillet was in California\nTotal snobs as it relates to uh you know one of the finest fast food restaurants going but if you ...\nSo just north of California to Oregon fast food made the list period you know the west coasters evidently you know not not getting down with that whole\nFast food thing and I don't think that's really fair because fast fast food is changed a lot over the course of the times I think it is you know fast food a lot better than it was you know here's something else I notice if you've noticed um at your restaurants how many more restaurants\nAre putting calories on that made you know when when they first came out and they started talking about making laws requiring fast food restaurants but the the calories up on the edge of on the board of the back with while you're working so you know how many you know how many calories in that bought a burger for example\nMy whole feeling of the time was it really wasn't going to change anybody's eating habits and I don't know based on the latest statistics on how we're doing with the\nWith all those kinds of things if we're really if we're really making any progress as it relates to obesity but I have to admit in my own case you know what I'm willing to admit when I was at least wrong about myself and my own case that if you really did seem to make a difference with me and made a difference in the choices that I Would make I don't I Would see how much\nFor example is you're you're going to uh to I'm trying to think of an example of that has calories on their menu someplace we'd go to all the time um\nOh those star steakhouse and you take a look and there's a piece of prime rib there's like an eight ounce or thinking their cases to if it's a twelve ounce in the sixteen ounce and you see the calorie\nDifference between the twelve and a sixteen you say to yourself okay I'll go with this well say myself a few calories now obsolete the prime rib\n'cause I Love it but I have to admit that ah you know it does make me give a few other thoughts to what it is I'm ordering you all have to take a look at French fries versus baked potato versus versus the vegetable and believe it or not despite what I said about cauliflower broccoli there are vegetables I Do like I like asparagus\nOne of our listeners out Facebook said a wrote that was ... I like asparagus makes your peace day but it's good\nBut um\nIt's always amazing to see what goes into the choices that we decided to make what what it is that we're going to eat when it is that we're going to eat it's hum what it is that we find good\nOh did I tell you that cottage cheese made the list of most hated\nI actually like cottage cheese tofu made list in West Virginia I don't think anybody in West Virginia Beach do who really hummus made the list in Kentucky [laughter] pesto is the most hated food in Ohio they don't like pesto\nUnbelievable it's interesting\nVery very interesting how they came up with this whole idea of things that we love and things that we have well mainly the in this case it's a heater episode it's only the things that we have three forty or time seven with three two one two five nine fifty\nSeven with three to five nine fifty if you'd like to join us here on Cape your seat hey it while I'm thinking about let me talk to you a little bit about them build advisor the\nVisor homeowner's insurance bill advisors a website is an interesting website I find that concept very interesting negotiating bills on your behalf\nAnd when they first started going and they still do this they negotiate bills for uh for for just about anything that you get on a regular monthly basis your your um electric bill\nJust like you're trying to expand your business\nSo he like to give you an opportunity to to get up into getting running into show you exactly what it is that he can do here's this number two week one to zero three Seventy five three seven that's our window to eat one to zero three Seventy five three seven he's at the un B. I. E. W. E. N. dot com right or the FBI\nIs going to be evidently turning his report over to\nCongress is investigation into the allegations against Brent Kavanaugh a it's a good be revised sexual harassment investigation or they were supposed to receive a tub sometime this afternoon a coming out to lunch\nClosed door meeting today so the majority leader Mitch McConnell said he would triggered the process that could lead to a vote as early as friday and the confirmation roll call over the weekend\nThat's provided a course\nThat he could move things along senators is a small number of top aides will be allowed to read the papers at a secure room in the Capitol complex and I assume they started reading that today although I also would not be surprised to hear Democrats\nTrying to figure out a way to stall and to not read it today or even tomorrow because again this is all about the lay delay the late\nThis is also rapidly becoming a time\nWhere\nI think there are fair amount of people who are very very concerned\nAbout where we're going with me too movement\nHow the me too movement has been corrupted as I said it corrupted to go after potentially innocent people and we've been talking for days now about living in the world where you are presumed\nGuilty until your proven innocent or the president of being roundly criticized he was at a rally um he had this to say this is at a rally last night yeah this to say about how he thinks this is a very scary time for men in America\nWe have the guts\nTo say that it's very scary time for young men in America when you can be something that you may not be guilty [laughter] which is a very very very difficult time\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that have been there for many of us the Braves or just it really does you're going to be somebody that's what's yours higher like somebody accused you of something\nThat has to be a woman as everybody say what somebody sort of gives you something you're automatically guilty around you are surely guilty until proven innocent that\nIs one of the very very bad thing that gets life right\nNow that's obviously one of the worst things that's happened you know we're we're we live in the American justice system where now it is prove yourself innocent and you are presumed guilty\nAnd um [noise]\nThe thing the only certain categories of individuals are going to be treated this way now I said a little earlier this hour and I'll say it again I I had been very lucky in my life liability privileged life I happen to think I'd let a privilege lights for reasons other than\nThe colored by skin but I Would even be willing to concede that maybe it's been easier for me growing up because I Am white maybe by American Experience wouldn't be the same if if I were African American or some other ethnic or maybe I wouldn't feel they've been treated quite as fairly but\nWe seem to be going into a time period here whereas the relationships things like the types of charges or accusations that can get you fired without even bothering with an investigation\nAre happening to people that are in my age range and part of my ethnic group\nIt's not happening to a whole lot of other people will Bill Cosby I guess would be a notable exception to that but then again I think it builds case again for a long time he denied those charges for a long time\nA lot of folks thought he was innocent or those charges until just so many cases came forward is so much evidence came forward that his guilt was proven but a Bill Cosby's case\nHe went through the court system he went through the justice system he had an opportunity to defend himself course these self employed\nSo it's not like somebody could fire him somebody might not air his program\nJust because they don't want to get involved in what's going on but\nIn his case if there's some sort of a hearing going on but in the case of some of the other people it it it it just feel it feels like the rush to judgment John slider who's the was the former\nHead of papa Johns I think is an example of that a\nMiddle aged white guy I mean that the we need to feel sorry for me he's got plenty of money\nI'm sure he's still got old as you know Bob job stocking if he sold off all of his public job stuck I'm sure you've got plenty of money so we don't need to worry about him but here's the guy who was making an example on the phone call in and maybe he should have been smarter than to do it\nBut he was talking about colonel Sanders your he papa John's gotten involved\nIn the whole NFL thing the whole\nKneeling on the anthem and he was upset the players were kneeling for the anthem and he wasn't afraid to go public ally in say so even though we had a\nBig advertising relationship with the national football league he wasn't afraid to say that so he got on a conference call and they kept asking him about it and finally he just said you know back of the day colonel Sanders used the N. word\nAnd and and nobody ... made a big deal about that\nIt wasn't him using the N. word from the standpoint of calling somebody the N. word he's using it as an example\nAnd\nHe loses his gig on the board of directors he's gone the company can't wait to part ways with him\nNow maybe maybe that was just the excuse that we're looking for to get rid of the guy I don't know but that's not the way it came out that would appear as he was judged he was judged for using the N. word like he'd call somebody the N. word not the way it was that was used that would\nNot have happened that would not have happened to somebody\nWho happened to be from a deathly group or somebody who had to be a bit of a different gender those are the kinds of things right now they're happening to middle aged white guys a lot of middle aged white guys are worried not that we want special treatments we just want to be treated fairly you know\nTake take what we say in context do some investigation don't let people go do fire people don't chastised people don't proclaim them guilty without any evidence\nThat seems to be where we are going at this particular point in time or I think a little break here for the top of the business will be back next hours seven month three two one two five ... ... if you'd like to join the show I mean are you a middle aged white guy do you feel like you're being a being a single\nDose of folk

it along to you know we've we it seems like we've we've developed kind of recurring themes that we keep going back to on on our show today it's kind of food [laughter] of course food I I think about food a lot and I love barbeque\nAnd\nTo me that was maybe the most exciting thing about moving to Texas was knowing that I could probably have great barbecue and every other corner and that's pretty much been the case I have not had bad barbecue especially bad risk it I've had nothing but great beef brisket since I've been here in one place that I Do enjoy\n'em\nIs decades to be in you've you've never been to decades I saw this and I thought you know that's all it usually takes for me by the way 'cause listen to my kids are grown\nIt's it's just the two of us and the pets and she found is only it's too hard to cook for too so we end up going out a lot I mean we go out to eat all the time and uh so well that's a it's a daily conversation what do you what do you feel like today I don't know what do you feel like today\nAnd um there are certain categories that we've become a kind of like a rotating basis we haven't had a barbecue in a while so all it took was we've seen this story to make an excuse to get some barbecue a decrease in which we we have numerous locations here in Houston a Dickey says having an all you can eat ribs promotion\nFor like Nineteen I think it's like Nineteen Ninety five they start you off with four ribs do sides and the butter roll and then after that they'll keep replenishing the ribs to two bones of the time until you've had enough over many that may be and um\nEven though my a competitive in these days are in the past I take a look at something like that and I can't resist the ins and saying\nWell that I could probably I could probably get myself about thirty dollars worth of ribs for Nineteen Ninety nine so are we might try that tonight maybe I'll see they're\nRight let's get back to the terms are a little bit is going to bring up to a couple of things you know\nPlayed a a a\nA cut for the president on his way to a rally where he's talking about what he thinks is a very very scary time permitted America men in general and probably middle aged white guys in particular\nAnd I wonder I'm I'm beginning to wonder\nIf that's going to have some impact on the midterm elections\nCertainly I think what's happened to Brett Kavanaugh is going to have some impact I and I don't think Democrats even begin to understand what a motivating thing it is not because not because white guys are feeling picked on middle aged white guys that feeling picked on\nBack in April the Tropicana recently improving his performance in Atlantic City can play signed only forgot it in terms of annual gambling revenues what the Fox is this

she always looked straight into the camera this works out much much better that way if that so I have hope you have a chance to tune and listen and by the way we haven't um we have a light the page at least like Jimmy ... come on Facebook\nAnd or or the Jimmy rich or baseball that's what you want to look for the Jimmy ... show that's what you look for on Facebook hosted by the folks that view in the I. E. W. E. N. dot com or right before we move on here\nWant to talk a little bit about a recording of ... financial risk is a mortgage broker you know a lot of people don't know what a mortgage broker does or what makes it a mortgage broker different ah from a from a bank or for example or a a somebody those mortgages at a bank\nWell if you call if you call your bank or any bank or to get a mortgage you're going to talk to one person and these are going to have one set of terms basically they'll have like a Fifteen Years thirty year here's what the interest rate is years with the closing costs star that's it\nTake it or leave it you're done there is no negotiation there's um there's just whatever that bank is offering what Rick morphing does with the mortgage broker does in this particular case is Rick has relationships with banks all across the country\nSo he talks to dozens of different banks at any one time and he knows that some have certain things that they're looking for others have certain things they're looking for some are offering certain interest rates are offering something a little bit better depending\nUpon what your financial circumstances are so what he does is he takes your financial information and he perished you with whatever bank is good to be the best deal for you and your family and that's how he saves you money now he'll get a he gets paid by a commission from whatever bank\nYou end up getting your mortgage would that's how he gets paid you don't pay him anything if he's doing all this work on your behalf so I recommend it highly he uh got us our mortgage for this film that we have in the spring and uh he just he did all the hard work you know we were busy moving we didn't have time to\nCall around looking for for for a mortgage that's that's what we hired him to do he he did a great job and I know you'll do a great job for you here's this number to eight one eight four four thirty three hundred that's doing one eight four four thirty three hundred ... financial to eight one\nEight four four thirty three hundred his website is streamlined approval dot com that streamline approval duck I'm\nAll right it it was fascinating to me is how we could allow somebody's high school college drinking\nTo become a disc qualifier just sit on the Supreme Court or even to be president of the United states and here's here's here's what I'm saying this\nBright capital evidently drank in high school which is we know is not allowed\nUnderage drinking that part of it but I did it I'm guessing a fair amount of you did it teenagers have a tendency to do things that are not supposed to do\nBut then again there are teenagers they don't have fully developed months and we in the news is those off times don't make great decisions same thing with college students I mean college students a British are still like the party right party\nAnd I'm sure there are still under age college students or participating parties and are participating in a very striking\nThey too are ... or is that\nReason enough disqualify somebody for higher office is it enough to disqualify you as a U.S representative is it enough to disqualify you as vice president or president of the United states because in\nLess mine mine was killed wage many brain cells from drinking seems to be didn't Brock Obama fully admit to using pot didn't fully admit using pot when he was young\nNo no this is Bill Clinton didn't inhale Bill Clinton didn't inhale I I've seen pictures of Rocco Baba trust me he's\n[noise] he's fully they really [noise]\nThat nobody had an issue with that\nWhen he ran the became person the United states nobody focused on it it wasn't a big deal wasn't a big story\nEven though that was an illegal thing to do\nIt's very disingenuous nothing I'm surprised by the pockets\nSee that gets involved all this I I I Know this isn't really about Brett Kavanaugh drinking in high school I Know it's not really about him\nDrinking in college it is it is a perjury trap\nIs what it is the reason why I got a question so much and the reason why CNN and some of these other numbers are running so many stories about it is because if the whole sexual assault thing fails and it would appear to be it's going to if that fails\nThen\nThe next thing you can potentially do I guess it said that he lied to the Senate Judiciary committee about his drinking and therefore he committed perjury and therefore he needs to be disqualified\nAgain it's the backup to the backup\nNow\nI think a lot of people around to it in fact I even saw were Nancy Pelosi supposedly said today oh no no no no no no we're we're we're not we're not interested in\nIn a\nYou know getting this guy an office of the number moving in that way I don't know that I well I Know I don't trust there but I don't know that I totally believe around that whole thing either but the biggest thing of interest to me is what should and shouldn't just qualify you for better or for higher office\nIf we are going to eliminate everybody\nWho committed one of the seven deadly sins at some point in time in their life something tells me we're not going to have much of anybody left to choose from\nWe're certainly not going to have the best for certainly not going to have the brightest I'm just wondering where do we draw the line can we can we draw a line in the sand somewhere can we come up with a list of things that okay if you've done this\nUnder no circumstances can you qualified to be a senator us representative Supreme Court justice any of these officers we supposedly hold in high esteem although the member of the house and Senate it's not exactly being held in high esteem these days I mean is there a list we can come up with\nSeven with three to five nine fifty if you want to join the conversation\nA wall murder yeah I'm pretty sure if you murder somebody that um that you probably wouldn't qualify but other than murder [noise] um\nWhat else could potentially be on the list that that would we could all agree would disqualify you\nI Would think you know\nWould stealing disqualify you how about embezzlement\nInvestments might be something that would disqualify you because you're stealing somebody else's money by for example I'm pretty sure that I might have now I don't know my memory is a little bit fuzzy\nBut I might have been guilty of going to the big ... big top was a a convenience store that was like across the street from where we lived there is a busy road where where I Lived as a child and and and the rule was you want to talk about committing\nA deadly sin at least as far as my father was concern I I've I've I'm thinking I was probably\nEight maybe nine years old and the rule was I could ride my bike up to that road and stay on
