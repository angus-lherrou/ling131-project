{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Oh you cited I like going what don't you like about driving in Louisiana is at the speed traps\n... well that and also it just so especially when you're going through um I'd always call red sick I Can't think of Baton Rouge we go through Baton Rouge has just always so backed up there and if it ain't right where they\nGive us even you you said it may in Baton Rouge has kind of like a little bit New Orleans a little bit Houston it's inland a little bit it kind of reminds me of a cross between both cities\nUm but you're right it it expanded too quickly Baton Rouge grew faster than the than the local government was able to deal with the infrastructure they don't have enough roads Austin's kind of like that too I guess I'm speaking the obvious here you know\nYeah it's really that bridge right there in Baton Rouge it really is because you know it's two lanes on each side and it just it's just such a bottleneck and then the the enter change go to it and everything are just so crazy\nBut like you said it was never designed for a traffic in now yeah it'll happen there's just going to always be a nightmare oh on back Florida a couple of weeks ago I stopped in the fall Exxon station they're broke the bridge and got myself a gas station restaurant ... hand\nYou set it he's absolutely right about that you know people always tell jokes about I don't eat the gas station sushi or whatever I I\nI've never seen gas station sushi before but I have seen good food at Louisiana gas station and I was just something about Louisiana Man I think it's some of the best food on earth and I say that as a person\nWho enthusiastically moved to Texas many years ago specifically for the food well football was certainly part of it you know you just gave me a great idea though Peter I know there's probably wasn't your intention but I figured out how we could simultaneously solved two problems at once I'm I'm\nA I'm a two birds one stone kind of guy he's got a problem in Austin with liberalism agree or disagree agree\nThey got a problem in Austin with traffic agree or disagree agree All right so here's what we do get back to the roots for now on if you want to travel around Austin it should be legal to drive a car you can only go around town on horseback in truth Texas tradition I'm Talking about what should the punishment I don't think there's a punishment for Coney enough\nFor I mean because after all climate change in the global warming they're gonna have to accept this law if we go to Austin city council and proposes a ridiculous law like that they're gonna have to listen to us simply if we start the conversation with well you know climate change global warming\nA you know you're you're you're Priuses and enough everyone has to ride a horse for now on or you're destroying the environment and just like clockwork all the liberals or move up to Dallas what do you think Peter\nI like that yet I really like building it up and back\nBut you know I'm an idea guy that's what I Do have an idea person I Do enjoy the food in the music in Austin but oh God the politics did you hear that one recently we talked about this on the show it's now illegal for restaurants in Austin to throw away food you either have to recycle it or use a compost heap\nI Know about compost seats my uncle Steve's got went up in Fort Worth he's he's one man living on a large property compost heap works great for him now imagine you have hundreds of people that your restaurant all day\nYou have to do something with all that food Austin is going to stink I\nKnow that the thing about the rats and everything you're going to have\nYeah you said it Peter hey man good called brother is that what what were you call it about Cajun food was there something you wanted to say about that I covered it all thank you\nI think you've nailed it Peter good call anybody wants to get in on the seven when three two one two five nine five zero you know we got to talk of to write are talking about right now there are two Castro brothers one of them went away to run me a\nHousing and urban development but the job the Ben Carson currently has nobody ever talks about that part of the reason why is I think Ben's doing an okay job but the other reason why is there were so many problems when when the Castro's were in charge of housing and urban development Julian Castro specifically that now that someone else's running it we just don't hear about much about it anymore\nWhen Julian Julian pretty stupid but boy if his brother didn't didn't say hey here hold my beer I'm going out dumb you this is substrate up coast to coast George Norris stuff watching Castro is on CNN the other day and he makes a pretty outrageous claims\nHe says that Jared Kushner you know Jared Kushner you know that Jared Kushner he's that nice I like daddy Blanca tribes has been that you have a question is a very nice boy with Jared Kushner\nHe's been talking to the Saudis about what to do about this ... they found by the way they found a body parts of his today in some garden or something isn't that creepy\nAnd this is just a regular day in Saudi Arabia we could pretend like this is that this is shocking news it's not people journalists get murdered in Saudi Arabia just like they get murdered in Mexico people could be headed in the streets in Saudi Arabia\nThis thing with your Marcus Chanay it's sad and it's scary but this is the tip of the iceberg for what happens in the Saudi king them anyway\nSo walking Castro's on CNN and he makes this far fetched claim as he's making this claim the CNN and\nGr poppy Harlow stops them and goes I didn't know that we haven't heard that walking Castro claims that Jared Kushner put out a hit ... killed\nUp before we go out with like your take on a the apparent murder ... Republican Senator Bob Corker chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that he is being blocked\nOff by seeing some of the key intelligence so he says there's been a clamp down on further intelligence update the senators the White House responded saying look at not from our ah I Know that you're not in fashion right now and that you haven't had a chance for me if I'm wrong to to the the intelligence and he's talking about but what is your reaction to that concern\nFrom you're ready public and get ready to bonkers or to start a new\nPuppy that there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a ship with an enemies list to the crown prince to NBS ... and ... the prince that may have acted on that one of the people he took it actually goes on Mr ... soldiers there and\nWe don't have I just want to be there for viewers we do not have that report\nAnd reporting to that effect or not you know there have been repaired and yet it back a long and short to be investigated\nYou saw me on social media for some for somebody I think progress dot org there's not even see I wouldn't take the ... that occurred to me though is he's making this absurd claim we should add the X. files music\nOr what their reaction to that concern from your Republican counterpart\nOh I'm I don't see that there's been a lot of discussion about this there'll be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting the jury parishioner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies with friends to NBS in Saudi Arabia\nFriends that may have acted on that one of the people that he took action against\nMr changes to their hunger\nI just want to be there for viewers we do not have that were born\nIn her know where you're getting a recording\nOr by our good stranger about the long and short of it [laughter]\nI Love all of you then you get\nMe to the\nIsraeli\nYour when you live\nGive US government furniture mated America's\nWe are seeing\n\nTough talk from the president ... says the mass migration continues to head north toward the southern us border Fox's John decker live at the White House\nPresident Trump continued his focus on that caravan of thousands of Central American slowly making their way to the U.S border with Mexico\nIs the sheer these beret show rushing by un dot com [noise]\nI mean there is\nIt is a thrill six as we get started on this Tuesday Afternoon here on K the RC am nine fifty seven month three two one two five diversity that's the phone number to get through I've got to give away some uh\nSome seats today I got to get to hear because I've got to get the a list of names to the boss in time for a big meeting of the mind you've heard about the meeting of the mind saying I Hope you have\nAs I probably should be promoting it a little bit more than I Am so let me make up for that before we get started on today's program which is\nI get to have like five exclusive gas and you get to invite if you're one of the gas that gets invited you to\nInvite somebody to to join you while we do a kind of a a roundtable with all of our live local Texans talk show host including yours truly and Jesse Kelly\nAnd kid Webster junior and Charles Adams we're going to all do a program or on the afternoon of November the second\nAnd we're going to have a we have a got to have a theater at um at the at our hearts Houston offices which is what we're going to broadcast from we're going to have a food\nCatered in from gringos get free Tex Mex to enjoy and if you would um if you would like to attend I Will tell you a little bit later this hour on how you can you know when a spot if you will\nJoin us for that live broadcast and bring a guest along with it so stand by for details on that first of all want to get started on the show today I Want to talk of this this is one because I realized about myself that I I\nI'm probably part of a vanishing breed here I Am a full ... customer service kind of guy you know self serve world\nAnd that's becoming more and more evident to me that we are rapidly getting to the point where we're going to be completely waiting on ourselves and it gave it came into real estate agent at two different things one which happened today I'll get to that in the second but I've been noticing this lately you know something we have in Houston\nThat a lot of other places don't have is what I Would call sort of a cafeteria style ... actually it's kind of a hybrid of cafeteria style restaurants where you go in\nAnd you walk up to the counter and you play short order and then you go through the line and you grab your stuff or after you place the order you grab your drinks at least you get a number and then eventually somebody will bring the food\nOut to you there isn't any set waiter or waitress it's it's kind of semi self serve but what I noticed about which is kind of interesting to me is most of the places now that are doing this are popping up on their screen gratuity\nTen Fifteen twenty percent and\nThey're not really giving you an opt out or at least if there is an opt out it's pretty hard to find and I'm thinking to myself who's going to pay twenty percent on the tip for something that's basically at least partially self serve\nAnd I I certainly not going to do twenty percent I got I'm twenty percent and then some if I'm getting great service at a restaurant from a waiter or waitress because I understand the big part of their living but none of it's cafeteria style when did we go to the idea that ... that you should you should be to make out of the cafeteria style restaurant\nSo that's one of the first inkling that I've had the other thing I've noticed and this is happening more and more at the grocery stores that I go to\nA not so much it HEB do patronize HEB but also patronize Kroger and every now and get all patronize Wal Mart at the grocery store we go to every now and again\nThey are eliminating more and more of the full service checkout lines genetic more of the more you check out light and\nCovered Ailes adding the scanners where you could just go through the store and you scan your own stuff and then pay at the end against basically self serve when it comes to the\nGrocery shopping portion of it nobody there to certainly to check you out and I'm sure it at some point it will be virtually impossible to find anybody to check you out and I was also at Wal Mart today\nWhich gives me the next part of my story here and that is\nNot only were there no full service registers open not that I needed one to be open knowing where they're no full service registers open only the softer registers were up and when I walked up to the young woman there because I wanted to get air my tires\nAs a buck fifty and that takes quarters so I was getting ready to head or two dollars and ask you about could I have change for the two dollars please\nI Need quarters and she said I'm Sorry we don't make change\nHuh\nDo do you have James you're at the store certainly there are some people who pay you cash I Know that that these dispensers here will give you will give you change exact change I guess we'll give you what what kind of change you want but surely will have access to change I'm Sorry search against store policy\nHuh [laughter]\nIt's a good store policy that would give me change how is that possible how am I supposed to get changed you use H your air that I Want to use its your gas station right over there as a Walmart gas\nStation at Walmart air and you will get any change to use it no I'm Sorry sir I Can't make change\nNow I don't know if that's a real\nStore policy or somebody told hurting somebody asked for change don't make change but clearly there is very little customer service involved when you\nCannot help the customer by simply not asking for a really big super big favor here am I I'm just asking for quarters so I could but it's a very my tires\nAnd she can't make change\nSo I go over to the Wal Mart service station and they told me why well we can we can make change for you here I said well how come you can make change and she can't she said well what are sciences Wal Mart but we're not really them\nWere us so evidently the gas stations even though they have the Walmart name on them are independent from the Wal Marts or Walmart store itself what do you mean you can't make change\nDoes that make any sense you it doesn't make any sense to me what am I missing out of this picture and are you noticing the same kind of thing what what routine customer service item argue used to getting that you just can't get any more or it's getting harder and harder to find someone three\nTwo one two five nine fifty seven one three two one two five nine fifty that's how you get a hold of\nMe here KP RCA I'm nine fifty again I'm looking for customer service that used to be routine that it's getting doggone hard to find any more are you a full customer service kind of person who just doesn't like this new self serve world against someone three two one two\nFive nine fifties how you call

I'm In shock I'm Still in shock uh we live in a a rapidly we're moving rotating into a self service world and\nThere's some things I guess I don't mind or on my ... my own gas I made the days of having somebody bumped your gasoline I mean there are probably a fair amount of you listening to this program right now the don't remember a time when there was some service attended there to bump your gas and the clean your windshield and to check your oil\nI mean that other than New Jersey which just recently\nGave that up there they think that that's been gone a long long time but uh you know that the\nThing also at at cafeteria style restaurants there is a little little strange to me I just got a couple of phone calls and this would again if you'd like to join the Jimmy ... program all you have to do is a dummy up seven month three two one two five nine fifty Robert ...\nHow do you feel about your office is it just a space for your company or is it a space to help you grow your company for new age cues to satellite officers with we work you can find a space that works for you is it we ... space matters to learn more\nChoosing an energy company raises more questions [noise] can make by like Christine natural gas was smart [noise]\nWork and I find a company to do business with the news the market that option [noise] my [noise]\n... homes and there's [noise] there's\nEntertainment [laughter] sites [noise]\nFly video streaming now on cable or see radio dot com [noise] tapped the Jimmy beret show pays the Jimmy beret show continues\n[noise] hey here's my number would you like to join me did I Love to have you on the show seven month three two one two five nine fifty seven month three two one two five nine fifty Iran am nine fifty K.

could attend the afternoon of November the seconds than your ... and you can bring a guest as well\nAgain all you have to do is go to the gym a bird showy or you'll find me on Facebook by now broadcasting live\nAll right now while we work on that\nLet's also\nTalk about a couple of things number one if you want to weigh in other tipping thing I'd love to take some more phone calls and that 'cause I think everybody has a formula about what they do I mean what what's the highest percentage you ever to have you gone higher than twenty percent had gone higher than twenty five percent because somebody was just so while standing or you like them so much\nGuys you thought while she's really cute I'm going to give her fifty percent because she's she's treating me like like a young girl man and not the old man that I Am do look at me when I say that I don't do that\nBut at any rate I'm curious if you have a formula some people have a formula for tipping um do you blame do you blame the wait staff if\nThe food you get is not cooked properly see I don't I don't because I Know they're not cooking the food they're distributing food now if the food comes to be cold I'm probably going to blame them because they didn't get\nDelivered to me that it's either way but I'm not going to blame them if there's something wrong with the way it was good in particular if they're going to make sure it gets fixed up and and usually most of these folks are very very good at that against seven when three two one two five nine fifty if you'd like to join me you know the uh one point six billion dollar mega millions jak bothers to live by did you buy a ticket for this\nYeah we were talking last week about\nHow funny it is to kind of fantasize about spending the money and what you would spend the money on I've got a story here\nThat are claims to know the number one thing we would spend lots of little survey of people what to Americans say they would do if they won the one point six billion dollars the mega millions and by the way you don't get one point six billion\nBecause you're taking it as as a lump sum and not in the new it he paid out over time you get a lesser I'm Out don't where you could you can hang out at the it's nine hundred million and then of the nine hundred million the state of\nTexas is going to take it up is going to put a thirty percent tax on it and federal government is going to put a thirty nine point six percent tax on it but you'll still have four hundred probably four hundred\nFive maybe even five hundred million dollars probably five hundred million dollars or more in order to to be able to play with so what would you do with the five hundred billion dollars the\nNumber one answer Americans gave for what they would do with the money number one answer Sharon's with others thirty three percent said that was the top thing they do second was saving are investing\nThe money for the future in other words you take at least a Twenty one percent said that you take at least a portion of the winnings and you would put it into something that would grow maybe leave it to the grand kids is a great great grandkids are maybe you'd start up a foundation\nOr maybe you you would donate to your uh favorite pet charity\nOr coming in next at nine percent and I'm surprised it's only nine percent\nOnly nine percent of the first thing they do excuse quit their jobs\nQuit their jobs and I'd like to think there will just probably two reasons behind it I'd like to think that one of the reasons is many of us really really are lucky and enjoy what we do for a living and I caught myself blessed when it comes to that I've I've always done this have always done radio and I've always loved doing radio and I've been doing it for my whole adult life\nI've been doing it since I was basically Seventeen years old in one form or another and I can assure you I'm significantly older than Seventeen now so I've been doing it a long long time and I've been very blessed and very lucky to have worked with some really great radio stations and to have made a decent living doing what it is that I Do\nSo I don't see any reason to stop doing it when you love doing what you do why would you stop doing it that's number one but the\nOther part of it is even if I were being inclined to think about retiring or ... just quit working 'cause I ... don't don't need to work anymore that kind of a big tip off\nAlthough\nIt's almost impossible to get away with winning that kind of money and not being hounded for the rest of your life for one thing taxes even though I guess it went through the the Texas House it it it it was never passed Texas has never\nGiven you an opt out\nFor anonymity you're not allowed to being anonymous lottery winner here in Texas Texas one of the states that forces you to public identify yourself as to who you are so that makes it very very difficult in order to maintain any level of privacy and there have been some scary stories there's a there's a couple of people\nCan forbid who actually were murdered because of their money or for their money lottery winners murdered so between ... every charity known to man trying to get a donation every relative\nThat you have and really don't have is housing you for money your family\nIs probably how to do for money you know we think of all the great things that would happen if we one that got him on the on the lottery we don't stop to think of all the not so great things that would happen [noise] um\nThe way a study published in the journal of gambling behavior concluded that contrary to popular belief winters did not engage in lavish spending even when he when that kind of money you have a tendency to be used to living a certain way\nOne of them is what I presume I Can't really tell 'cause itself in the distance I Can't really tell what the markings are but one is what I presumed to be a police helicopter\nAnother one\nIs a very very small group of protesters with signs are the only one I can really read says is black and brown lives matter\n\nI guess those the only ones that matter right white ... why do these groups get so offended when you say all lives matter\nI thought we were about\n... I thought we were more about inclusiveness than we were about diversity or actually I think kind of inclusiveness and diversity or one in the same I think what's the difference I Would help all lives matter\nBlack brown\nWhites I don't care what male female everybody everybody [noise] uh okay so there there's the one group of protesters there and then there are two pictures that bubble kind of interesting of\nBaby Trump you know baby Trump is that balloon that first showed up in London it's a balloon that looks like Donald Trump is wearing a diaper it's called baby Trump it looks like he's having his effect\n\nI I just found it interesting that you needed to take any pictures of yeah mega hats or science supporting the president he just took pictures of protesters and baby Trump\nSo I I guess I'm going to have to show I conclude am I reading too much\nInto the shoe liking conclude from this that cheap out so they do\nIs I'm supporting the left\nAnd not supporting everybody said they give you the police chief you should try to figure out or you can be a political\nYou know I think police chief is one of those areas that you have an opportunity to do to bring everybody together because it's your job as the chief of police to protect all the citizens of the city of Houston and we have a very diverse population you know both are wide both are black and about a third Hispanic\nYou should be there for everybody that I wouldn't want to send a message\nThat you are maybe more inclined to protect one versus another just saying All right here's another topic we discussed at length yesterday that show\nThe border\nAnd the quote unquote care of and they came up quite a bit was the motive is your next door for the Trump rally because they came up quite a bit but there is a university Marquette University\nOffering students a chance for quote a border awareness experience during spring break\nTo race consciousness about the issues facing the borders such\nAs immigration economic development human rights and my personal favorite social justice\nThere you go\nCan we guess what side of the story they are going to be on are they going to come to the Texas border with Mexico and take a bunch of kids from up north to deliver in Texas have no idea what the issues are that are facing us who who who are being taught that open borders or a beautiful thing\nYeah we we shouldn't have any borders you know should be able to go wherever you want that is true freedom man\nIs also a hell of a lousy way to protect your country and to provide security which is the number one job\nOf the federal government is to protect its citizens if there was no other job\nThat the federal government had it would be the one job that they should have which is to protect its citizens and secure border is part of that protection of the universities website says the trip is meant to immerse the participants in the border culture\nOh\nDid you know there was a border culture what is border culture what does that mean uh it's it's too immersed the participants in the border culture and the realities of the many people in groups that live and work\nThere or does that include ice by the way does that include border patrol cars they work there\nOr we're going to give are we going to give a well rounded message about who is currently they're trying to protect their border are we going to give a well rounded message on who it is is trying to get across that border and\nSure there are there are kids and there are women and they're the ones that they never seem to show on TV you ever noticed this\nYoung males they never seen the show the young males it's like everybody is trying to come across the border right now is is it a a a mother and her kids like they're the only ones that are trying to get across the border\nVisits organized in part to the campus ministry departments and the office for intercultural engagements at this Milwaukee based Jesse with university\nWell\nThey may come from a religious background but you know there are plenty of liberals involved in the world of religion as we all do well now so that's going on All right here's another one to bring up to date on like a kind of bring up to date a whole bunch of stuff your day before we got to concentrate on hold Trump rally thing next hour\nI'm former president bronco bummer says there's a pattern Republicans running the economy into the ground and Democrats having to come back and clean things up\n\nOh I guess what he's trying to do right now is he's trying to take credit for what's going on with the current economy intel of course we have a major downturn of the stock market which Casey will not be taking credit for that I can assure you\nI I think that um in fairness to all presidents there are certain things that are out of their control\nI certainly do not blame Barack Obama for what he inherited as far as the banking crisis as far as the real estate bubble those were not the doings ... Obama\nHowever\nThe recovery that we had post all that was very slow and very tedious in abnormally slow for both of his terms and if he had done what President Trump is doing we were ... we would recovered from that a lot sooner than what we did\nBut that's not what he stands for\nAs Democrats damp or they certainly don't stand for tax cuts and they certainly don't stand for less regulation which are the two biggest things that President Trump did\nIt or to help through that whole thing around five we've got lots of audio this year coming up here for the Trump rally yesterday I've I've my personal favorite but I Can't wait to share it with you because you didn't hear it from last night also we have some reaction\nTo the rally and that we're here from a political scientist Ellen sex from UT Arlington coming up at four thirty two was sort of his analysis on what he thinks that really was all about and what if they translate to sue in the mid ... that was more just a couple of minutes I have you ever see the uh nine fifty [noise]\nA fun free play list on our high heart radio as there is a perfect playlists for any miss chip you're getting into if it's free it's for me and you hunter I hard Radiohead all your favorite music all your favorite stations all for free\nOr their motto is kill re control on their name is MS Thirteen they're one of the deadliest gangs in the world MS Thirteen and other violent gang spread their brand of evil and terror all across America including right here in Texas\nFor now identified I Am at Thirteen gang members are in jail according to what records that they kept turns to make them to death with a machete\nGovernor Greg Abbott and vowed to stop these monsters and all violent gang members because he knows that gang violence affects every corner of Texas here's Governor Greg Abbott\nLaunched the anti gang has horses all across the ... and now the feminine had already been written\nAs you're gotta there's nothing more important than keeping you and your family say\nAnd I'll do what ever read gather governor a political ad paid for by Texans for Greg ...\nIs our number twenty third what's new today on the free I her radio Hi\nTheory if only I our radio as long as he has the rainy out the only ... million the actually in between the Dodgers in White Sox\nWith the IRA ESPN Radio wherever you\nAre you storing baseball gloves with rich history said each other in the championship for the first time in more than a century World Series on ESPN Radio he's on the free\nKP RC Houston and I are safe from\nGallery furniture made in America studios Welcome to Katie RC nine fifty [noise]\n\nI think happened permission Brady Fox News President Trump's words down on the thousands of migrants heading from Central America to the U.S border with Mexico\nBetter I think president for young people because we are more aware\nOf what I like about ... is that that right there I\nHe seems to be [noise] inclusive can you think of any better or work accomplishments [noise] unless you count going to jail for ... an accomplishment then or now\nShots fired wow if you had to decide right now which candidate would you say you're getting\nTowards I'm leaning towards Ted Cruz most definitely a he's someone I voted for in the past\nUm I really think any for his family and I think that's something that's a very important Texas value um\nI also really like a few of his other\nYou're voting tomorrow who'd you vote for takers art crews and what things about crews are you a fan of\nI dance freedom freedom to own guns and get on immigration I kind of stuff\nYou see what happened there right there weren't a ton of cruise supporters to Texas saying them among the student body but the ones that were new widely supported Ted Cruz they knew what he stood for [noise]\nThe only accomplishment anybody good enough for ... was well I got arrested for DWI\nYeah well\nI guess the accomplish that much and he works hard you work hard will sort of a washing machine does it mean are we going to vote for for the United States Senate alright where you take a quick break fact wisdom Trump rally audio to share with you coming up next it's the Jimmy bird show am nine fifty K.
