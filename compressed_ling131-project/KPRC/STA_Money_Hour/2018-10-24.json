Independent Business data is been positive for small business\nA wage growth I mean we can keep going leading economic indicators have been doing well but I thought this time we normally start kind of talking about the specific real estate but I Would like to start talking about the macro economy\nBecause I think that's what I was on everyone's mind right now\nIt's been a really really interesting market um [noise] you know the tax cuts are have been very powerful\n... more than ... and that you know let's say you were a use an example and I make up a couple of numbers but imagine from it that you're Home Depot\nDraft and pre tax you know two years ago you were making Fifteen billion dollars you're paying\nKhalid five billion in taxes and keeping ten billion\nAnd now you're making the same amount of money but suddenly your tax rates cutting ... two and a half extra billion dollars\nThat finds its way into product origin nation bonuses at it you know buyback of debt I'm buyback share as you know business acquisition research and development and all the use of feeling the economy\nAnd more important than that to people that run Home Depot or the people that run your local tire shop or loan you run your local restaurant feel like the government treats them\nWith respect for what they do and values their contribution society in that confidence right the confidence is great you go to talk to anything from a hoagie your guy running a hotel hey how's your business small things are going great so it's been a fantastic run since since the last presidential election\nAnd what we now have a courses mid term\nAnd um we were talking ... right before the show that in every midterm year\nThe stock market declines correct you've got uncertainty I think I'm the markets as gosh I can deal with any set of rules and regulations you gave me as long as you keep static for a while so I can adjust my business model to suit\nAnd if you're going to change the rules let's say the Democrats take the house and they changed the rules and businesses have to adjust and they don't know what those rules will be or have to adjust the investors say gosh I'm going to go on a buyer strikes\nAnd not do anything now the same data that shows that the market falls into the midterm shows that in the period between the election and the end of that year there's never a negative return\nAnd typical returns over the forward twelve months from the day after the midterm are always positive and you usually ten twenty percent\nAnd if you think about this politically you have in this case the president and who's going to say okay let's say it's now the day after the election and his election comes up in two years what am I going to do to create the best opportunity to maintain right so we're going to flood the market liquidity\nWe're going to create as we can fiscal and monetary stimulus we're going to talk up business and probably the big bugaboo which here we're going to settle our trade dispute with China\nAnd when all that happens it's like you're standing in four feet of water holding a beach ball what's your hand and foot below walk and you just take your hand off and get taught the baseball bounces back up and ... that's where we think we're are but there is a bit of confusion in the market well and I think\nThat's exactly a great point because what you see right now is everyone's overreacting I think to the recent fell off\nA large part I mean we haven't seen much volatility for the last eight years so when it takes such a long time for the show up people forget they go back to the last I guess last memory they had which you and I talked about it's a two thousand eight a financial crisis that's what's in their head and all of a sudden they think we're going to repeat that\nEven though we're close to the end of a business cycle it doesn't mean that we're there yet and I think many people will lose sight of that and I'm Glad you brought up what happens with Mitt terms uh right after him and also at the same time the you're the you're after so you know investors need to not overreact at this point\nWe would agree with that we think the economy's in reasonably good shape if you run around and talk to people in the real world and there you know like if you try to find a roofer in my market\nHe says you know I tell you what I can show up and you know Seventy five days and there's a shortage of labor people are well employed uh taxes are low and the regulatory environment is benign is beneficial to starting in running businesses um you do have rising rates\nBut you could you could imagine a situation where\nLet's say over the next three or four or five months two quarters\nThe pace of business and we're sitting here looking at marketwatch right now and it says new home sales plunge I Love the word plunge plunged to a new ... magic that really happened is they're all five percent or something like that but but you know if I had Lyme plunge gets headlines and all fibers that nobody cares right\nBut you could see pulled tea or us Homer us ships him or Home Depot or may tags and you know what we're getting a little bit less flow or selling less stuff into that space and the housing is a big part of our economy and the economy could roll over a little bit then the fed\nBy the end of the year will say well gosh maybe we should stop\nRaising rates and so I could see a cessation like a cease and desist on the fed tightening cycle next year in which case rate stay stable on the economy\nGenerally speaking is very healthy\nWell you're absolutely ... remember of comic Mario Draghi it would be just a language change that could fuel and economy I mean the fed doesn't actually have to do anything at that point but them indicating next year that they would cause I think would be a big show of the stock market oh I think\nIt would be huge I mean the the other you pointed out is there hasn't been a lot of ... crying last couple of years so so people are used to this idea that the road is always smooth and when the road isn't smooth the car bombs and they go okay or lives up to make a better example you're in an airplane and you hit an air pocket or there's some turbulence and people aren't comfortable flying\nYear maybe more concerned than they need to be the pilot comes on and says hey planes actually crash bellowing made it and they make us all a plane and we know we're doing and I think that's kind of what the administration needs\nTo say right now I tell you what we're going to talk about that more about the economy and come back with a special guest barrel lease there by the website SCA wealth outcome you're listening to the female\n[noise]\n\nThough about to be as da money or on tape your seat nine fifty years loop Fetters\nMost [noise] working backed\nBy the website SCA wealth dot com\nWe're here with our special guest barrel ... he's the manager about tiger as a CIA operatives ... real estate fund ... wanted to talk about trade tensions here with China and the U.S I mean you are\nSomebody that has frequently visited China I think you recently just got back from a cow so I'd like your perspective you know from someone who's been there kind of seeing the economy all we get is the headlines and you know those do not think that is the bigger story there some love you're taking what's going on a with a trade tensions here in the U.S and China\nWell it was part of Trump's um early agenda 'em to better manufacturing and better trade you know globally in and out of the U.S and he's already done that with the EU and then with Mexico and with Canada new NAFTA so he's actually accomplish quite a bit in this regard\nAnd the next course goal is to China and we're negotiating that now or at least attempting to get ready to negotiate now I was just in China about nine weeks ago and as you know the fun the fun we run as as exposure to gaming and the game ... and ... and Hong Kong Macau and a couple things kind of come out of this [noise]\nUm the first is the speed at which China moves is frankly shocking to somebody like me that lives in a bureaucratic environment ... real estate and California's bureaucratic [laughter] the Chinese just open the Hong Kong Macau bridge\nAnd this is called thirty miles across the ... the the South China straight and it connects Hong Kong Macau takes what used to be sort of up to wish our three mode of transportation commute to kind of like thirty five minutes and improves transportation in this region\nAnd the overall plan plan at these sort of Beijing level is to turn\nHong Kong the ... on the island right next door which is called ...\nInto a combination of New York Las Vegas in Orlando they would like this to be a domestic vacation market where Chinese people can have a great gauge without leaving China that's like the first five years let's get it logistically organized with airlift capacity in catering a hotbed capacity and things like that so that\nI mean you were talking about Home Depot the products they make me walk us through that a example\nIt's it's wildly disruptive particularly in terms of sentiment if you simply look at\nUh the Chinese stock market's down twenty five percent and if you take a company like wind which the company we owned by the way wins price has been cut in half fundamentally economically nothing's happened nothing's happened when since January twenty they reported this than not this happened but the sentiment has become very bad\nUm but the complexity of supply lines I mean let's say you buy you you've got a new refrigerator the kitchen aid refrigerator here's probably made in China or if you buy\nAn elegy TV and algae TV is actually made by a South Korean company produced in China shipped by a Taiwanese distributor to a location here in Houston where you by there are\nThirty or forty or fifty people involved in simply the logistics of getting you a TV and these logistic systems in ... to be efficient\nOrganized and reliable and companies live on that and you simply can't go to Home Depot go oh you have two hundred and thirty thousand please excuse me two hundred and thirty thousand products and eighty percent of our made in China and get care in this way others and stuff like like lumber\nOh we want you to rip all that up and re engineered like\nDo calibrate all of us do that I just can't do that well that seems very destructive mean all the things you've got to recalibrate because of these tariffs and I think that leads to the solution that you're not talking about the that eventually you know hopefully this comes together pretty soon\nAnd if you look at what happened to also with NAFTA and with the\nA lot of this posturing right both sides need to present something to their their constituents right Trump needs to say hey look\nI'm going to get you a better deal and she's you paying needs to get you I'm going to keep you as good a deal as we can and we both need to sort of in a good negotiation both parties can leave the table believing or at least go telling their principles back at home that they got something\nAnd that's what we need to get in the ... I'm hoping the guy to get that is Larry Kudlow Larry if you're listening [laughter] you have my listens to the show and you have my full support when when we come back and was talking about\nInterest rates in the Federal Reserve is a good next topic and we'll get into more about the economy if our website se will succumb to be a female [noise]\n\nYou are listening to the rest of your money or need help with your mummy called mugging look no seven one three\nTwo one five walking\nBack by the west side of the wealth outcome we're here with our special guest borough east manager of ... tigers opportunistic real estate fun\nYou know we've been talking a lot a lot of subjects but I think one we have to talk about this on the forefront of probably all investors' minds as interest rates and the Federal Reserve me getting your perspective on what's happening I think many think we'll see more more interest rates are you know step up and if ... you know going into two thousand Nineteen\nDo we see a continuation of the fed raising interest rates and how's that going to affect the economy and specifically some of the sectors that you manage\nWell I think that the one thing investors need to remember is that interest rates inflation or like to dancers in a tank one follows in leads the other and the fed is only really raising rates in response to what it's what it sees the inflation market\nAnd so while rates may go up based upon increases inflation real estate historically has been a fantastic vehicle for capturing inflation so the normal way things work in our in our business and then I think max mentioned the fact that I was a hundred and sixty two years old\nI'm like ... or something so I've been through into quite a number of cycles\nIs that there's an initial sell off upon the idea that rates are going to go up in our space in real estate socked generally and then six months later there's a catch up when the recognition becomes oh my gosh how am I going to participate in the inflation trade\nHow can I capture for myself\nSome of this inflation answer uses real estate because leases are tied to inflation or certain companies like we're just talking to a game you're gaming lodging apartments can re priced their product immediately so inflation and real estate usually go hand in hand very nicely and if you go back to periods where you've have\nWhat we call a normal fed tightening cycle which is what we think now we're in now real estate's is really well\nBut the answer to the earlier question is\nIf the economy continues to grow then yes I Would think the fed would continue but you're starting to see feedback\nFrom the leading edge of our economy let's call that housing so\nAnd that's both the builders and then there's suppliers people that make gypsum and you know lumber and stuff like that and then the suppliers to them some might be you know the Maytag the Home Depot is right that whole food chain is a huge piece of our economy I don't know what the numbers are but it might be\nTen or Fifteen Percent unemployment in the U.S is is in this food chain one way or the other ones are you also include the mortgaging dies and whatnot\nIf that slows down and it looks like it's starting to slow down now the fed will probably recognize that considering their calculations ... well gosh maybe we get past the December raised and we don't have to raise were done\nOkay we have taken the extreme edge off the economy we're not going to overheat now\nBut we need the you know we need people to buy a bailout houses right so the mortgage the mortgage rate is very important now historically if you look back over Twenty years for people are paying now for ... and my first mortgage the eleven percent are cheap but it's more expensive than it was two years ago I asked you if you're a couple of years ago three and a half and now it's four and a half or five\nThat that puts a dent in how much you can buy\nSo our outlaw again are hedging strategy\nIs we're roughly twenty percent hedged against rates now but we think that the slight slow down the economy happening at this minute may cause the fed to become a bit more dovish moving into twenty Nineteen that's\nKind of our outlook wasn't agree I think you've seen what longer term rate seemed kind of picture and and then as you mentioned to me to come at the tango when that happened earlier this year I mean some beginning you're the same thing concerned about interest rates spiking interest rate sensitive stock sold off\nThen as you mentioned inflation kind of stepped up in terms of the concerns you saw those rallies now you're back to that tango all over again all over again this is a rewrite basically the second week of February a\nFrom if you measure backwards from time from that maybe eight to ten weeks real estate stocks decline call ten percent and they've recovered all that now we're doing the exact same thing again by the same playbook just different time frame now part of this also is the midterm we you can't\nDance over the idea that investors whenever there's a potential changing rules regulations and taxes um it is not unreasonable that corporations go gosh I don't know what to do I mean for instance let's imagine no and that's been decent at a time in London\nAnd if you talk to businesses about the impact of Brexit they say gosh I don't know I don't know what the rules we'll be right I've got this business I've got employees all over Europe and I've got pages and pages of rules and by the way they're gonna give me new rules ... pages of age and I don't know what they're going to say and so I Can't plan\nFor employment and trade and all these things until I see the new rules and they're arguing about the new rules and it's in the midterms a little bit like that it's like okay let's assume that some of the rules change or don't change who don't know which rules or how they're changing so businesses will naturally stop acting\nAnd when that happens consumers will naturally stop buying right so we're in a little bit of that but the ... leaks out\nIt'll be subtle one way or the other and we think from there it's probably a pretty boy market\nWell you know I think when you start to see this fall to the first thing that comes to invest on is a recession you know instead of seeing opportunities I mean opportunities and when things sell off and they're cheap you know people don't respond that way just our human nature doesn't allows but you've given us a good analogy of a recession and I love to do that with our visitor well a", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "24"}
