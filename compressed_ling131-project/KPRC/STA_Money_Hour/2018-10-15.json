Bek rules and restrictions to apply\nSo a slight limiting well yeah it just like commercials as a side effect I think I think my uh my screen refreshed the very inopportune moment there so it's about half and half as far as sectors going a red and green [noise]\nAh well I Want her my people last week our newsletter was entitled what goes up must come down on the ball totally last week close the market's down about three and a half percent on the broad us in\nA cab primarily a and you know it's a it's mostly noise is nothing new fundamentally that changes either and the economy or even in the underlying stocks are indexes that would have caused that volatility other than just the fact that you had a big run up and are there is no big break down and the larger bullish trend\nOr so we just want to keep that in mind I mean there's ... people say well what did you do last week we didn't do anything we're already prepared for some of those kind of a sudden this volatility which was laid out I think for weeks in advance including going back several weeks what was going on to the small cap space\nAnd then the concentration of the risk amok six names that made up basically the first half of the year we're Ninety percent of the U.S and people have hundred games\nThat we did not feel was going to shake out very well in addition to that two thirds of the U.S and the five hundred companies were already and correction or bear territory\nThat is a sort of a noteworthy topic as well so you have the buybacks you have the leverage with margin debt you have corporate laboratory with lots of things I think that played into that\nBut not necessarily unexpected and then of course you mentioned max the tech heavy index the NASDAQ\nA has also falling a little bit we have half a percent apple down Netflix pulled back more than ... percent each a Netflix fell after him and James Last this prize target a little bit apple dropped off for Goldman said it's a giant earnings would fall short of it's\nA this year as the man in China slows uh but I think the kind of more interesting news to me is that the world excuse me the country's\nOnce largest us retailer Sears bankrupt yeah bankrupt\nEddie lamb or the c._e._o. currently is going to be stepping down effective immediately he does remain the chairman\nAs part of the bankruptcy Sears is going to shutter a hundred and forty two stores towards the end of the year so they also again filed for chapter ... bankruptcy protection early today after years of staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of CEO ah ah\nActually the CEO of ... own money in fact in lap or who serve a sea of about ... years will step down as the effect of immediately and then a remain as chairman a hundred and twenty five year old retailer wants the nation's largest said again today is filing for\nBankruptcy ... yeah ... that business model I mean you just could not do you come back to what you said earlier what did we do in regards last week we did nothing we were prepared\nYou know sometimes you don't get a lot of compliments for defense but this morning at to my clients were in a you know stay in office getting their wheels done sitting there going through that process\nRight before you might\nWant to tell you thank you very much he has it was a very it was a pleasure last week and it was very ah you know inspiring to see my portfolio over the weekend that the market and he just I think the U.S and we went down I said five percent he goes yeah\nHe has that we didn't budge that much in the gives again as you do to you guys and managing our assets and he was very nice to see what a portfolio do and volatility so you know sometimes we just don't get the people calling us for defense but it's just a nice thing I wanted to pass on that yeah no it it's good to hear\nBecause I think we were not necessarily surprised by some of the more recent volatility and I think we expect someone to go in the year we're not again I mean none of the major brought in the season the United states a fundamentally broken down in a major material way we've certainly seen the S. and P. fall below the fifth day moving averaging that was not worthy but it's done that before and Braley back\nI think our main concerns have been international specifically the emerging markets and we saw them take another leg down after being already bear market territory defined as twenty five percent from its highs are more it was already twenty five percent from tied down now about Fifteen Percent for the year and the S. and P.\nA down from its highs about five percent about up five percent year to date here now through the end of the day friday or the NASDAQ off about eight percent from its most read a recent highs and so we've had a little a pull back not quite a correction a bucolic correction it to ten percent [noise]\nBut um you know it just kind of interesting to see the world is changing\nAnd not only in sort of the ... the change between the U.S domestic economic and market performance versus international\nBut even within the economy and we talk about this a lot more in our vents we get into more detail\nAbout how the underlying economy is changing and the likes of business models like ... and I'm and I'm you know a hotel or air being be uh some of the software and then of course you know ... which is going on our artificial intelligence and biotechnology and three D printing\nI mean it's pretty amazing how it's changing of course the retail world as we know is change in many ways the onset of Amazon and before that it was even\nSort of ... and the online optioning and things like that but here you have Sears k-mart stores have really been struggling Best Buy at struggle I think I'm much bondage path forward\nTarget struggled for a while and I think is also found its path forward so um you know they have to change and become more relevant or become irrelevant obviously and then uh their financial performance will will will suffer and General Electric cars another latest example one of the largest industrial global industrial conglomerates\nAnd it has just been suffering from a stock price standpoint and trying to recalibrate itself and sell all business units and become profitable and are trying to get his business and find its footing again it just has lost a lot of value a it's a real shame to see it but it does happen and before that there's been others and there'll be others since then you know the\nOnes that used to make up the Dow Jones industrial average or just different now and now it's apple at a you know it just not General Electric and the international paper echoed act\nWhich companies need to take a pay some jazz assumed her you know the basically creative destruction we've been seeing a such a rapid pace\nYou know the one thing is is the reshuffling at least has been in the United states the United states companies continue to emerge as the leaders but\nWhen I see headlines like the one I'm looking at now and I've been reading about it you know he's talked about emerging Asia the new Silicon Valley that is something that we hopefully our regulators as are bickering and a an arguing about things that I find irrelevant at times\nThey start looking at that you know the rest of the world is going to be very competitive place while we have the advantage now I think you mentioned not too long ago we had these current trade tensions and will probably win the short end of it but the longer term end of it that's something that could be a little bit more difficult\nTo continue to win but I keep hearing you know a lot of these other countries especially Asia they're going to be very welcoming of technology companies the next innovation I sure hope we don't\nArgue our way out of this because that's going to be a bad thing at least the ... has been here in the U.S will come back we'll pick up on the economy could buy the website SCA wealth dot com you're listening to the U.S have money [noise]\n\nTo the FDA money or on TV are see nine fifty years loop Patterson and Mike Smith [noise]\nYou've got the markets obviously shown some volatility last week we also wrote in the newsletter what comes up let's go down and we've been writing these themes along the way especially over the last few weeks some of the leading indicators including not only um so the market indicators but really also some of the or even pi and my numbers which are broadly\nAnd widely used as an economic indicators not necessarily be I think people have been suggesting I think there's some areas even on the so the the media circus\nThat the economy can be fact overeating and that's what the fed is trying to really prevent by raising rates and other sort of tamp down is overseeing the con me\nBut the economy seems to be recovering on strong footing still recovery um I think we've been able to sort of get another last leg and even a faster rate of growth and we've been able to get over the last eight years and that's in spite of\nIn spite of the tighter monetary policy\nIt's pretty unbelievable the thing about it what would it be we've got four point two percent last quarter our second quarter will get something less than that obviously the third quarter and maybe get something three three point something percent one or two percent for the entire year of two thousand and Eighteen something we've not seen in a decade\nNot seen in a decade and that is while the Federal Reserve\nIs raising interest rates and arguably more importantly shrinking its balance sheet and so I think that's even so could you imagine if rates were still is zero and we had new tax policy and deregulation\nAnd new trade agreements even with some of our uh foreigners are close to the south of a north of us do you imagine that kind of optimism job creation the labor markets could you imagine that'd be overheated ... that would be overheating\nSo that's the point really in many ways is that it I don't think functionally there's overeating I think people are arguing about that and saying that it might be the U.S employment rate declined as we know three point seven percent of rate unseen about half a century\nUh again reiterated by the bureau of Labor Statistics and given the booming labor market you've got the Federal Reserve has has has I think some reason to worry that the economy may be overeating that's their stance um although we are getting close to the peak of the business cycle I'm you know and we might be in sort of the other side of it a little bit\nThree labor market indicators suggest we are not\nFully you know we're not necessarily in danger overheating job growth is certainly high arguably too high wage growth is still low and picking up and the employment rate is still slightly below the level consistent with little employment\nYou're looking at the unemployment rate right now three point seven percent we're seeing a little wage growth\nYou know you have the U.S labor market it has some room to expand I think this is sort of the conclusion here before it hits full employment that's good news and the fed ... what the Federal Reserve need not worry that the tight labor market is indicative of an overheating economy this not yet I think it can come it's just not yet\nA and so hopefully they won't get 'em too tight too quickly so we'll see them raise rates expected to do so one time again in December and probably at least three times and next year\nI'm so we'll see what the rate rising but they also see them trying to shrink their balance sheet try to normalize the federal preserves balance you consider where it came from like seven hundred\nBillion to four and a half trillion [noise] um they did that so they can manage longer term\n\nPlan so we'll talk about that more will come back and let's see ... last week's newsletter what goes up must come down with a lot of all Philly how to

I started watching and then they started ... you know gave up a beginning there I'm just pointing\nA word you know we're not and that's when\nWe got three here right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no I got in a pretty good above that that that that climate that's sports community that I just I'm not fond of I Know this yeah there are clear just how they've been in the Philly fans and just\nA little too not just for you yeah there you are to other fans like maybe in the Texas region kind of are they in the same way or just like those guys particularly annoy me oh I like is a dynasty programs I mean 'cause you know the New England does have a dicey program the red Sox Yankees dynasty programs\nThat can give you a little ... I Lived up there and they're very annoying and very annoying um but you don't find like I'm just not saying that the same but you wouldn't find like an aggy fan anywhere in the same category\nNo because every ... yeah I mean that there are some pockets of ugliness and then all stadiums but generally as a collective group of the New England fans are yeah region in general\nCan't watch the games the voice too late to got to know what to record it that's the thing to do yeah can't watch students basically too late for me\nI mean it's struggle even Saturday Night things up you know I'm getting a lot too old member last uh last year at World Series because the games were in LA because of some games are rude or early summer all of his groggy the next day coming up we'll be watching again if we get there 'cause it's a life on a lot of fun to watch we're going to get there were\nI look at look at Mr positive attitude I like it\nWhen it was the that was the last year was the best thing that happened to the Houston area since the rockets\nAnd that's why I'm Harvey ... city of just so far and the Texans are three and three yeah gone three narrow can really really a sloppy wins but you know it's a win win take 'em take them um yeah so your team that you don't like last\nLast night to Europe you know ... last November the ... I don't like them oh they know okay you don't like the ... I like that I liked the chiefs new look that's a good team ... really good team yeah\nThey are now they when they were undefeated going and now they got one last yeah right how many ... Peterson one loss or no there's orange to watch that All right thanks for sports are sorry for that had to\nCatch up on our sports talk here next to the third time\nIn fact the um the the market last week in the stock market less we kind of reminded me of protection the first the first three games yeah and then the last three games kind of like well we're winning the gloves were winning filled pretty sloppy looking on friday at all\nOr recovery ah right away right there for ... anyway we'll do that and we got on the role that we see each friday's trading obviously it was up for the day for the markets overall for the week pretty sloppy three and a half percent or more down the broad and sees\nBut I think friday's trading show that the ... was sort of a wrestling between the buyers and sellers is now the time to buy what evaluations you how does that look a but I think you can find some of the rationale between this struggle if you will\nAnd the wrestling about are buried in the data I mean we talk about the third quarter was we no end in September thirtieth and coincidentally the breadth of the stock market the number of dancers versus decline or is that all pink back September twentieth\nOkay um so we've seen that with the corporate buybacks was blackouts generally began with two weeks prior to the end of the quarter and in many cases last until they firms report almost all the major companies nowadays are joined by backs but they are shut out of the market for the period of time so bag buyback suspension\nIs one reason for the market pull back\nThey have to suspend all corporate buybacks and by the way we're adding record territory this year for buybacks trillion dollars in buybacks\nAnd it was also there are a number of natural sellers in the market price to earnings reports even more so when we see the market has been as good as it has been\nIt's been a pretty good third quarter so you say you own Amazon or you've known that plugs for\nThree years and you've seen some wild game so it makes sense to trauma position or sell back some stock because\nIt in in cases it misses a earnings you want to dodge those big drops and then finally not many institutional buyers are buying until they get a clear view I think of how companies will be doing in the earnings season so most wait to see the results and forecasts and then they begin to get a I think more interested so\nYou have all sellers and marketing constrained bars in the market so in addition to that we have a while everyone is pointing to interest rates as a fact of the marketplace move the rates were the only thing affecting socks they would be on the rebound because then we saw Thursday when bond yields finally fell\nAnd instead the Dell sold off about five hundred and\nForty five points so if you're concerned about your four one K. I. R. A. or savings I mean don't worry about that kind of activity broadly that's noise you want to get the broader trends right\nYep plenty of time I think to think about positioning yourself understand your discipline to risk management strategy but you do need to get to it if you're not done so already\nAnd uh so we'll have them or will have some new highs potentially but we'll have some more noise and I think um you know we're we're in this transitional phase and this is a sort of the broad take away I think many investors have to understand", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "15"}
