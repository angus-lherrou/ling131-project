of\nThe story I mean but the the the argument was a ... is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment about movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nAnd it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah but um but we now and I've not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like they just a patch or yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you what it's not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background already been planted there and they show it

though that these corrections these bear markets Mike you said this is the first segment they're happy they happen from time to time in fact they they happen more often than we've been experiencing

at it as a difficult one for many people and what we find successful and we do it every single day is you got to start with a plan that basically helps you understand the level of risk and you take to

emotion that you don't have right now because many people have that emotion but take the emotion out of investing\nAnd that's going to be if you can't handle that you need to turn that over to someone else that can do that for you and that is one of the biggest mistakes we see especially with weeks like last week well and then ask them if you are approaching somebody that can help take this off of your plate is what is their view on what's going on from a macro and fundamental standpoint\nI mean many people just park you and fines or ATF said just say we're asset allocating and just you know hope it all works out in the end well but that may or may not be good enough and I don't know some of the state my entire financial future on that\nBut in the earnings slow down potentially we've already largely priced than some of these things like the recipe the price to earnings ratio the multiple it's tumbled a little bit below us twenty your average okay so rich valuations\nWe're not in the bubble territory it's hardly a convincing argument against stocks right now although we see investors could be making the case that beginning and this year two thousand Eighteen\nThat uh you know euphoria rained right we ran off the January it was a big almost double digit gain and then of course\nYou know what down sideways for the rest of the year and then we had a big vaulted week last week and brought down some of those games so yeah we have our expectations they said they come back into reality but you know the silver lining in this is that the market evaluations or easing a little bit\nWe have the essence of the five hundred\nValuation the price to earnings ratio the twelve months forward looking price to earnings ratio in January was at Eighteen and a half right now at Fifteen point seven so there's a silver lining valuations have gotten a little bit more in line that's a fundamental argument\nThat's a fundamental argument that's how that's one of the factors not the only

care so we started recap what took place last week and started off the mark of October and therefore the a fourth quarter to what some of the things that had really not changed so the macroeconomic and fundamental factors reviewed many of those things the last segment the show\nAnd then you see what her bond investors and whether what took place in terms of yields a and a strong poor correlation positive a correlation between starting bond yields and subsequent five year returned suggest that Banksy bond higher bond yields have been translate the future\nBetter future returns and so uh this makes sense as income takes the lion's share of bond total returns\nAnd the bond repressing also restores the value in some crowded credit trades including the U.S investment grade Bond's a lot of people in the best thing that space right you got baby boomers try to get their income uh and they invest in these investment grade bonds\nSouthern merging markets us denominated bonds\nAnd you also have higher bond yields the increase the portfolio diversification benefits right so you've got bonds and they can provide a better cushion to risk riskier holdings in fact a such a stock support fully us that's why they tells you how they balance portfolio stocks and bonds they sort of cushion the blow\nA diversification different asset class and as a result you have negative price returns shouldn't be a reason to disregard bonds instead investors now have more reason\nFact in our view to embrace bonds and a well diversified portfolio so they still have their place don't think you know that's something that necessarily give up on him because you have higher yields\nThis if you managed as we've talked about staying at the higher end of the credit curve no other critical investment great um and you need to still do what you want and why that's been a theme I think all of this year probably should be the theme for the decade of the century from investing notes you own and why\nThen you would have also managed the direction other words you to manage the sensitivity to rising interest rate environment\nSo if you have shorter ... and now you have higher interest rates as those bonds mature you could begin to reinvest those bonds at a higher yielding bonds theoretically so I that's generally been the case but just keep in mind just because it has the best of the great
