sell off blamed mainly on rising interest\nA in some ways the mark as having a fit about this one of them is on the short end of the curve they're beginning to raise interest rates right the economy's thought it was generally being stronger they're looking at the data they're looking at the inflation living with the labor markets and saying it's time to raise interest rates\nAnother point I'll mentioned by the way of the reasons why they should be doing this is because we're going to need some ammunition at the fed is going to be an interventionist and not just let the the markets dictate the policy you're going to need some ammunition later when we do find ourselves looking down the barrel of another recession\nAnd right now the few areas in their quiver because they have been nearly packed emergency interest rate territory for quite some time\nAnd the other thing to do so they're raising rates right the second thing they're doing this for a significant change\nIs that they're shrinking the balance sheet or the Federal Reserve they got to about four and a half trillion dollars on their balance sheet and different forms of debt today on on the ... to the Federal Reserve there's over Seventeen and a half trillion dollars in global central banks\nSo that's a lot of money printing that is taking place and now there we used to call that quantitative easing you remember ... when we were talking about the ... money printing and the buying a bond they called quantitative easing one or two or three times and loosening of the monetary policy in a very comedy the stance as well as providing liquidity to the marketplace\nAnd the markets ran up largely on that activity and news and it's sort of help pull us out initially out of the financial crisis is one of the components\nIn addition to that it's helped risky assets real estate or equity markets\nAppreciate because of all that liquidity it's needing to go somewhere\nNear the second thing that they're doing that is shrinking their balance sheet now so if you look at a chart that shows the increasing the balance sheet to increase looks like a hockey stick\nThe early going straight out before and a half trillion and now it's beginning to slowly roll off and how they're doing is not necessarily going out actively selling bonds and their balance sheet but they're allowing the bonds that are maturing\nTo mature and roll off and not purchasing new ones and so that again to slowly begins to unwind the balance sheet but that's quantitative tightening\nSo we've gone through now eight nine years of ... a combination of policy by central banks primarily the Federal Reserve here in this case and they have now changed that regime from emergency territory interest rates and quantitative easing\nTo raising of interest rates and qualitative tightening so you just have to understand that this is going to have some implications to the overall market we have been talking about this regime change them when they started doing it and ah December of Fifteen but really in two thousand sixteen\nAnd we've seen a lot of good things including the equity markets charts looking favorable\nBut a lot of that's beginning to break down in fact we talk about it in this week's newsletter\nSo it brings me to that head to the website register have not done so already we talk about some of this regime change what's taking place of the equity markets and how they affect you and your money headed website S T wealth dot com you'll see the SPA money out [noise]\n\nIn the hour on TV or see nine fifty years better so my my theory headline of the loop Dow forty thousand is coming but only after large\nPanic event passes forms analyst ... who's a macro economist pretty well respected but um I mean it's kind of [noise] I I guess it covers all bases right he's the accents but he was covering his name was on the other side are gonna get worse before it gets better yeah yeah yeah\nOkay forty thousand one of the al ... sure I guess anything's possible not not not anytime\nSoon but he also says ah investors should be out of stocks for most of twenty Nineteen ... that's a little ... so much [laughter] [noise] well\nUh I think it's really hard to have two things going on one being a pure mackerel economist because there's lots of other things going on\nA and also calling the markets are because as we can see sometimes there's lots of varying catalysts or risks that are sort of get outside the boundaries of what people used to uh look at the macro economic environment I think macroeconomic analysis and economics is frankly a part of our analysis\nBut then it gets a ... it's only one\nHow many hedge funds do I mean just you know if you pay attention to these things kind of even casually how many hedge funds macro hedge funds have you heard of especially post crisis it became very popular after the financial crisis\nHave you heard most recently doing well there's very few um it's in many ways I think it's been hard to make a macro case\nAh I think the macro case largely has been ... you know not great but reasonable economic growth\nCentral bank liquidity\nWhen that has really been a low interest rates low inflation that has been the story and if you've I mean that that's generally what you're looking at I think you made a bullish case we're stuck well now that's changing that's the point where I'm Talking about how the fed is undergoing a major change\nAnd the market is having a bit of a fit over it it's affecting affecting interest rate 'em and it's affecting liquidity in the sense that that they begin to roll off their balance sheet and we see the recent financial market volatility has been cause at least in part by the Federal Reserve", "year":
