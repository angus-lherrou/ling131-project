Mexico Canada agreement doesn't flow of a ton like NAFTA\nRight well he used to it yeah we could have called NAFTA to point I think we've all gotten it I think he wanted to get away from NAFTA is fundamentally change that I Am I I agree with that ... did I understand marketing but it's been sort of updated I think it probably needed to be I think many people saw that there were some things related intellectual property between the two countries\nProtectionist policies even in Canada and things like dairy largely those things have come down there will still however be tariffs on metal right now we see steel and aluminum but one of the countries of course we continue to have these intensifying issues with U.S China\nUm and so this is you know the the new North American free trade with him and his new agreement with our north and south southern partners is largely a good thing for\nFor the economy it removes the clout for them it was a bit of a club for us and I hopefully it's something that can be ratified by the U.S Congress\nIs far from done\nOkay so it's far from done because it's largely impart likely what's the the election is going to be about this issue and maybe even a new Supreme Court pick who who knows maybe even impeachment I guess we'll be talking about that too if they've got to take the take the house\nBut China's economy is also something to lose some steam and a lot of it I think has to do with these trade issues um\nWhen you look see the manufacturing slow down those\nLike the likelihood to Beijing will step back economic stimulus and other measures\nWe see this intensified trade for all the United states starting to take a heavier toll on the Chinese economy than it is at least at this point on the U.S economy we see weakening foreign demand we see sluggish domestic consumption causing some of these Chinese manufacturers to significantly scaled back production\nWhich has come out some of the recent manufacturing data so that manufacturing slow down\nA detailed report they're released over the weekend raises the prospects of China's leaders will step up economic stimulus measures to prop up growth not that they will necessarily come to the table to get an agreement done to improve their prospects for economic prosperity\nThey say let's print more money let's spend more government funds to keep the stimulus train going\nSo the new data show that the privately owned makers of cars machinery and other products stop expanding in fact in September as we see export orders drop to the most in more than two years\nAt the same time out a output by large state owned manufactures also continue to weaken so the data among the first major uh gauges of China's economic performance for the third quarter indicate that the U.S tried to trade light is beginning to take a bigger bite\nOut of the growth of the world's second largest economy China so until now the softening of Chinese growth has largely been due to a domestic ... control campaign that curbed investments and consumption by companies and individuals alike but since July both governments\nHave moved a beyond the rhetoric and the trade threats in it opposed Troy tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in each country's products\nAnd the expansion across many factoring sucker sucker weekend in September\nAnd downward pressure on China's economy therefore was significant so we see such pressure and economists and government advisor saying they will this will all likely prop Beijing to put in place more pro growth measures that scores of subjective thing but in the short term what they mean is it they will make credit easier\nRight easier credit policy they're going to take greater government spending and they're gonna spend more of it\nAnd put further let up on his drive to prevent it's already high debt levels from climbing um I guess they're going to continue to put more money and continue to spending deficits and create more debt for themselves so so far this year China's central bank has been on three separate occasions they've trim the deposits commercial banks are required to hold in reserve\nA fourth is also likely apparently by many economists and there's no doubt that the U.S trying to trade conflict will affect China's exports and the overall growth\nUm several cut production some will reduce the number of workers as in China and others may even shut down but the potential for more stimulus measures\nUnder court underscores the balancing act facing Beijing as it tries to defend itself from us trade offensive if you will and keeping China's economy from just buttering into some sort of a recessionary phase but if you look at some of the data", "year": "2018", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "city": "Houston", "day": "01"}
