I guess dot com slash radio\n... will happy to see some green on the screen for sure I think last week one of the worst we've always seen as a matter of fact we're getting a little mixed art for this week uh but we're overdue a balanced meal we hadn't nearly a trillion backward evaluation\nGlobally is ... evaporated so far and one of the worst months for equity since the peak of the credit crisis in over a decade ago so over two trillion of that just from the U.S and the five hundred a alone as index a slice below that two hundred and moving average last week that's the most since early to thousands sixteen so you know\nThis rally a you know or the stumps are this this plunger what you want to call it the PSA pull back I mean we we've definitely seen the second correction for the year of that ten percent or greater\nI'm scared a lot of people are an an and we've had some phone calls we've been talking to our clients have been kind of\nYou know feeling the pulse out there and you know we've been trying to tell her body keep in mind this is a correction you know we've not gotten used to corrections and it's been what almost nine years and we've had very little in regards to volatility so I think many people may see last week and it feels I think you know particular different it is no different if you go back in the context the history\nI'm normally we get to ten percent corrections within a year we haven't had that this year for the first time in a long time\nWe should we see three percent moves all the time five percent moves all the time in normal market but what has not been normal has been the amount of central bank liquidity in history in terms of anyone that's alive today we have not seen the experiments ran by central banks to this degree anytime in our life so it's fueled\nMass of speculation is fueled a lot of run up and credit taking in borrowing and in debt\nAnd now the unwinding of that\nIs going to create a lot of volatility hum interesting a new book by a ... if you're not familiar Volcker Walker was fed chairman back in the days of ... when we had high inflation\nYou know those my baby boomers remember the days where you could get a treasury at Thirteen percent but you also had a mortgage at Eighteen percent you tell that to a millennial today they look at you as if\nThat's your you must be line there's no way mortgage rates were dating percent they think today\nWith the movement that we've seen race at five percent that this was like absolutely super high for a for mortgage rates well all you boomers out there laughing five percent you would have taken any day of the week back in the eighties\nBut see this is the problem you know a lot of us don't remember history we don't remember a what those times looked like we don't remember how that ah you know encountered her portfolio's as a matter of fact\nJust before this a recent market decline I was talking to baby boomers as if I was going back to Nineteen Ninety eight in Nineteen Ninety nine having the same conversation\nI knew I knew many boomers on their side accounts you know what they're buying Facebook apple Amazon defense stacks\nUh and they were buying those as if like they forgot that two thousand the same type of run up happen buying them in paying dearly for them paying dearly for them and you know what they did it depending on when they got in\nSome felt ... I've had conversations well almost forty percent so even if we have a bear market and the market goes down twenty I'm fine you know that's the kind of mentality we had a way back in Nineteen Ninety nine so I'm I think last week was a nice little shot across the bow for those who got bullet proof\nFor those who started to venture out what happens when you get into a late cycle is people start to feel confident or they feel like they're left behind so they had cash\nThey didn't quite catch up so they start feeling like they got to play catch up and what that involves and you're taking more risk in your portfolio just in time for something to come out and scary or evaporates and well\nAnd at the end of the day that's where you got to be careful that's why we always talk about getting a financial plan put together for your own personal situation and then really help you as a guide to what type of risk you should be taken because I think the volatility is here\nIt's given me I think you get used to ... ... what we saw last week get used to that that will become very normal as we venture into next year right now look at the markets what is what is the markets like the markets like certainty\nWould've markets dislike uncertainty now right now in the shorter term what is the uncertainty point here in the United states the midterms right we've got we've seen now you can't turn on the TV or social media right now without seeing some sort of add some sort of political bashing all this stuff is happening now right we're in the heat of it\nSo depending on what's going to happen I mean she to know\nBefore midterms historically the markets decline because there's a lot of uncertainty and what's gonna happen and what's the ground weren't going to look like for the next few years until the next presidential election so that's certainly not once we get through this\nEither way that's just sort of level off so if you had to take the house will the market will respond to that and it will just at least it will no that's the landscape for the next couple of years if the Republicans keep it then again the markets will adjust and that's what the landscape looks like\nThan the other thing I think is going to be key to November is going to be you know gee too which is trying to us and the G ... meeting and a lot of what's leading up to it now I'll get more to that later\nBut I think you're going to start to see some negotiations some softening of this terrorists some of the rhetoric that we've been hearing that will be starting to soften him in at least what I've been reading and what I've been hearing\nNow that's both going to be good for the markets\nWhich again back to history once you get past the midterms we've seen I guess I don't think we've ever seen since Nineteen fifty eight where we did not have a rally and to the to up to the end of the year after the midterm so just keep that in mind if you're becoming too bearish was concerning for me was that with people went into this past weekend\nFriday was a nasty sell off people when it's the weekend probably\nThey kind of looked at the computer screen and solve their balances and maybe freaked out a little bit\nAnd the key is is just you know what go back to staying on point look at your portfolios and see what did you not like what happened and what is your game plan going forward\nAnd don't do anything irrational right now I think you're going to probably see a a decent little rally here I I feel more confident throughout the end of the year we'll probably see the markets pick up will continue to have some volatility but I'm not concerned about this tipping into a bear market just yet\nNext year I'm you know what I think last week's market decline has actually already changed the probability of what the fed is going to do remember\nFed talked about for rights right now if you go look at the probabilities were the market's been out pricing and to rate\nHikes for next year so how quickly things can change and keep in mind if we start to see the fed pause in their language that's going to be more positive for the market's a lot of things can change because when we come back
