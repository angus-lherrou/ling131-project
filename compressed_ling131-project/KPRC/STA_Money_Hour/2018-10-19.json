point nine percent a slight uptick from this time yesterday\nWith the stock market sectors consumer staples financials real estate and utilities are positive on this Friday afternoon\n[noise] well those are the more defense of sectors yup I'm sensing a theme I Believe you're right as we are we've been talking about this where are we in the business cycle which sectors are likely to outperform not necessarily always be positive depending on what's going on in the broad market also but which sectors are likely\nTo outperform and give you may be the best risk reward scenario and I think of the defense of sectors of suggested that might be an opportunity here in this sort of a shorter term um\nYou know you have lots of things to consider in terms of headwinds you've got slowing global growth they've got certainly issues related to the international emerging markets a strictly around their currencies you've got what had been a decoupling us or economically as well as the markets most important markets for investors\nAnd what's happening emerging markets there down you know scores close to twenty percent on the year\nUh the Shanghai in Chinese markets are bear market territory international markets are up and down bonds have been down\nUm you know transports down a little bit about that as well but um\nIs it going to begin is always going to be able to ... ... what's going on to the world markets and I think we've seen a little bit of ... going on back on a recovering and then you had the Federal Reserve of course beginning to withdraw or some of the liquidity\nFrom the market shrinking its balance sheet and as we know increasing\nIts interest rates and will do so again uh it seems to be in a December but one quarter of one percent and yet the breath of a market which has been a concern especially in the first half of the year and going into the third quarter we kept talking about you know most more than Ninety percent of the S P five hundred gains coming from the technology sector\nAnd a over eighty five percent of those gains coming from\nJust six stocks are we spoke yesterday about the number of stocks currently and still not all that far as the broad market from his all time highs\nBut the number of stocks you know in correction territory number of stocks in the U.S and the five hundred I mean below twenty percent thirty percent even forty and fifty percent down for the year so breakfast certainly been an issue\nValuations are becoming more ... uh I think I'll say reasonable ah have never begin sort of a bubble a stretch territory but\nCertainly becoming a little bit more reasonable positive things you have\nEarnings while they are red headed in the upper direction have are still historically pretty low earnings are also looking pretty good we're going to be over twenty percent year over your earnings growth a but how sustainable or those very important factor for stock prices earnings and\nInterest rates and of course we still have great fiscal stimulus somebody meant is deficits as far as the eye can see and we've got to government spending more than a trillion dollars and it gets in every year that's where it's heading to almost eight hundred billion dollars in fiscal deficits Seventy percent increase over the last fiscal year for the federal government\nMan you got government entering stimulus sort of the comedy that's also not necessarily bad\nBut in terms of some of the leading say canary in the coal mine that economic indicators you have housing you have autos uh neither\nOne of those look for chicken really stellar in fact we see existing home sales fall for this six straight months in September\nUs home sales again felon September by the most in over two years we see the housing market ... struggle to strike despite strict that costs the broader economy this out by the national association of realtors said today that existing home sales dropped three point four percent to his seasonally adjusted annual rate of five point one five million units last month\nHome sales have now fallen for six straight months a dearth of properties from sale\nFor sale have actually pushed up prices sideline many would be homeowners and of course the affordability becomes an issue when we see increasing prices and the affordability for the cost of that capital and the words interest rates go and hire an average mortgage rates getting above five percent again historically\nNot a great uh you know you've been people know it was\nDouble digits and and uh on up into the teens at one point and the seventies for mortgage rates and of course you know there are story low even at five percent but that can still be ahead went to affordability many people look you know they look at the price of the house but at the other day just like I think cars many times\nToo many people don't buy it on the price of the the the car or the home they're buying a payment I Want\nTo know how much does this thing going to cost me every month and can I fit that into my budget\nAnd we see in the existing home sales drop the most in the south and the decline in the west cells left sales were down ... point two percent from a year earlier that's pretty significant\nAnd the national association of realtors economists Lawrence Yun said that the overall this a decline appeared relative to a rise in interest rates\nAre well that's not necessarily shocking as we've talked about\nThis with the rise of interest rates how that may be sort of a head went to the overall economy and here we see it for the affordability and the effects that may have on interest rates including things like refinancing we've seen mortgage a mortgage rates\nMortgages and mortgage refinancing also coming out a little bit lower supply is also constrained rising building material costs as well as we see land and labor shortages while rising mortgage rates are expected this low demand the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs we noticed in September for the third time this year and again widely expected to do so again in December\nSo it'll be one hundred basis points a total for the year of two thousand Eighteen to are expected maybe three four two thousand and Nineteen and at least two of those\nI Would argue are already priced into the market\nUh also economists pull borrower Reuters had forecasted fixing home sales fall into five point three million from previous report a five point three four million existing home sales make up about Ninety percent of us home sales there were one point eight eight million homes on a mark in September as an increase of one percent from a year ago\nAnd at a September sales Pete pace\nIt would take about four points for ... months to clear the current editorial suppliers of six to seven month is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand also meet at home so ... ... medium house price increase for point two percent from a year ago two ... two hundred and fifty eight thousand one hundred dollars in September of man\nThat is that just seems like a lot two hundred fifty thousand I mean I Know people live a million dollars a multi million dollar homes but it just you know I don't know it just seemed like a lot to be a medium house price two hundred fifty thousand [noise] sounds good to me they would not matter much\nIf we had the uh we won the billion dollar lotto I mean the mega ball whatever they call it the power what\nIs our long legged ... like a million and Powerball you know the Julian dollar lottery you know a billion can lead to jump matching them I mean think of it a lottery money ... billion dollars I can imagine a lot of things\nYeah but uh\nYou know your odds not so good\nI mean what what would it rank in terms of the authors like getting struck by lightning twice I Believe this point point your odds would be the same as the Astros winning the world series who\nSo not so good that you had to go there I had to go to I had to ... hearts broken now I got ... seconds to get me through the season [noise]\nThat are going to hang my happiness\nOn a Texan [laughter]\nYeah I Love one [noise] look a lot of things in the technical commentary from last week's newsletter continue that discussion today the Dow retests the two hundred a line [laughter] so are you concerned about this market sell off well wants to two hundred a moving average will come back we'll discuss it also\nWhy one million dollars in savings may not be enough without comfortably a lot of money will be enough they show had lost sight SPA wealth dot com you listen to the SPA money out [noise] um\nKP RC nine fifty here's a little better so much lower than a breakdown in markets going back to early this year an emerging markets that evening\nNational markets will just say X us\nA guide states as hell strong for many parts of the year we started a year off strong in January ... double digits on the U.S and the five hundred in January and of course we saw big sell off in February the gay most all of that away and then we were out again sort of late here and a third quarter\nAnd then of course we have ... October starting the fourth quarter of the year two thousand Eighteen we've seen a sell off\nA and it's not necessarily going very pretty so what we've seen lots of headlines we've been talking about over the last many\nA couple of months even uh we were talking about the emerging markets back on to the beginning of the year but some of the warning signs we've seen on the domestic side is a slowing global growth again in the international and emerging space we see a breath of us market in terms of where the the returns are really come from you know only from a small group of\nCompanies are mostly those fang stocks plus Microsoft says the Federal Reserve were rigged drawing someone was acquitted ... as well as raising interest rates and all all all earnings have been good uh interest rates\nAre rising but still starkly low that's always the positive for the markets but how long is this going to last isn't sustainable that's the big question much of what we've seen in the improvement in corporate earnings has been a tribute to\nUh the tax treatment\nSecurity over the last two hundred days and for the U.S and be five hundred it's acted as support and sell off and soft going back to the beginning of this leg of the bull market two thousand sixteen\nBut as the intensity to pull back some intensified this year two thousand Eighteen the two hundred removing average has been tested more over and over again\nSo as the market tumbles you know as we're seeing again most recently the U.S will be five hundred as drop and retesting that two hundred a moving average a again a solid break could mean some trouble so given a two hundred day line\nHas been defined as the support level for the S. and P. five hundred for two and a half years with only minor violations a more decisive right below this level we made a minimum\nPoll meaningful short term implications so just keep that in mind so and again there's also keep in mind there is no indicator fundamental or Mac row or even technical\nAre pattern or metric\nIn its isolation gonna be all that useful necessarily for buying or selling signal but again giving how well this one on the two hundred a moving average just worked on the way up it would have to be respected I think on the way down so stay tuned about how these ... and the price momentum works out it has a\nHas worked well for us actually and research over the years and application as one important uh you know\nPart of the discipline of the recall sort of a three legged stool of investment is when you have the macro economic macro cycle where are we what's going on there the fundamentals\nAre stocks cheap are they expensive detectable analysis all three of those I think I'll back up a bit south of us when we come back and talk about a million

it does these days I mean ... billion like the mega million you know that's that'd be enough that'd be enough\nFor a one time deal yeah\nI wouldn't mind having just soccer way I'd invest every dime and you're smart smart that was I was reading that um what's his name uh three Lewis who's doing his mentor and a young athlete let's think\nAbout these guys that you know they they think they're going to make you know a hundred million dollars for the you know their time in the NFL or at an MBA or whatever and then they get hurt first season\nAnd they don't even get the signing bonus and then then what are they going to do so\nWell the statistics are pretty bad um and sense of the probability being high that many of these NFL athletes will be broke five years within their\nYeah final game same goes to the regular old people you know normal people in your investments and get a you get a decent Christmas bonus take the majority of it would have to work more you\nGot to find a way pay down the debt especially the high cost that and get yourself on track to accumulate wealth that's what you have to do and do sort of way I'll add that's a that's tax benefits to it I mean thinking about\nI mean the ... will be like contributing pre tax year four one K. getting the match gosh you got to do that just can't stress enough young people surprisingly\nDon't do enough of that uh but you know then you've got to leave the money alone don't go dip it in for loans and other things leave that money alone and you know if ah hopefully over time good things will happen\nAnd be smart with that um but you know if you think about a million bucks it's not what it once was again a million dollars would go a long way in most areas of your life but it may not be enough to get you to retirement age you're not a you know\nI don't know what would you be doing the auditing around the world or um you know world Traveller uh some big mansion\nComing aside but how how much can you contribute to a rough for your\n[noise] uh it's like you know seven six five hundred bucks or something\nLike okay so you just want to siphon off a convert something that's already in the count yeah to Roth right\nYeah but you can't there's no no real way to balance it sixty five hundred if you're above age fifty to catch it OK okay you're talking about and I talked about yesterday I was trying to get a handle on the uh the actual amount\nYou extra but a lot of years to get to the ... would be to have a what X amount of dollars in Irish four one K. is other investment yeah and then over on this side on the other tax equation look you know Bruce central mountain you're rough yeah to balance\nIt out yeah those are just you know there's an engine you converge did not lots of math around now that people can be helped get help with but the problem I think overall though as a million dollars I mean you see the commercials ride in sort of carrying a number of the arm of like eight hundred Ninety eight thousand and that's their number what's your number it was kind of the question that I think people need to answer that question for themselves but\nI think a million bucks is a you know it is still a common savings goal for many workers\nAre and you know who seem to have\nThat much money is going to and that will be enough last twenty or Thirty years of people last longer but I think a million dollar just simply doesn't go as far as it used to\nAnd when you certainly when you consider the sky rocketing healthcare costs costs of inflation you know it'll be worth even less overtime or by the time one you'd one by the time you're ready to retire for many people but then through retirement considering how long you may live through retirement so\nThat means it's important to figure out how much you are really going to need to retire comfortably rather than aiming for a big round number someplace so\nHow far will a million dollars go well one of the biggest challenges of saving were you know saving for retirement is accumulating enough money to cover your rising healthcare costs in combat the wealth ruining affects of inflation\nThe average sixty five
