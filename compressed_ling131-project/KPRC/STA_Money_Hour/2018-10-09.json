I basically a seven year high three point two percent of change\nAnd by the way I mean just to give not to segue into mortgages but mortgage rates of jumped by ... percent pass five percent signaling or some more price cuts might be headed that way but the the interest rate of the thing I Want to focus on treasury seven you're high the cost of capital higher\nAnd including things like mortgages so uh you can expect business owner businesses\nGenerally be paying more for their capital a so I think you have to consider that it is that a signal of the expectation of higher inflation is it a signal or are correlated to the ... move the impressive move the United states economy that rates are moving higher and the ... feels confident they can can you do so and therefore will see some inflationary pressures we're seeing some\nAnd wages and so it's not all bad it's um it's actually some good news economically I think the market is just a little bit different animal it's forward looking so the market is looking at the economic data we're we've been reporting over the last quarter of the market this is baked in by the way the next ... I ... the next\n... a Federal Reserve ray Hi hike thank you Mike\nIt's already in the market they know what's coming it's efficient and I guess you are for next year already backed it already baked in and so again while it is for its its forward looking number one in aid to the extent that it's forward looking\nIt's you know ... if it's already been scripted out that we're going to see one more rate hike this year's winter stricter and continue to Chris\nDye think that's a big risk though a that we've always said that withdrawing liquidity with central banks and higher interest rates are into an extent some of these trade tensions I think they can hold we've come a little bit more problematic but overall it was in perspective I don't think it's going to be a big deal\nFor Fairfax off of that that could be a boost equities keep in mind if we do see a pause by the drum Palin and he starts to show concern about markets and he thinks that maybe they're not going to continue to raise rates will that will be a boost for ah for equity to keep those things in mind well it's not all bad but\nI'll tell you another thing China I Do think is getting worried they're taking some action even within their central banks or to uh to ... liquidity well no but ... yes to an extent that has an effect on the currency but to provide more\nLiquidity to their economy or\nIf the sugar high if you will and so they're on the edge of getting in the factory standpoint of attraction there and so forth to keep an eye on and I think it's a big reason for the international Monetary Fund the IMF lowered their expectations of global\nOr just today so we'll keep an eye out before or after you also talk about how it affects you and if I had lost the SPA wealth dot com register for the weekly newsletter you're listening to the FTA money out [noise]\nFire fire ... fire house subs introducing new firehouse pub steaks up with savory state crispy fried\nChoosing an energy company raises many

fishing\nSo you know back to the FDA money our on tape your seat nine fifty\nYears or so as Mike Smith\nMarkets are off a little bit yesterday five hundred basically flat data points that's flat writes the Dow Jones industrial average down\nThirty six points also basically flat twenty six four fifty on the Dow uh and some of the international markets were up merging markets have been under a lot of pressure as of late a lot of it we talked about the treasury rates have not risen to five consecutive days and the spike has been ... you know I don't know what you say are\nPretty terrific in terms of the uh the rise and rates [noise]\nUm well see twenty basis point why since mid August up more than forty basis points the bond market looks pretty oversold I think because we seen rates increase so quickly and it just says remember for a reminder for our listeners\nRates increase bond prices are coming down from the universe is though is is is generally true as well so it generally looking pretty bearish if you're looking at bond prices but it will just remind people that are still constructive on bonds I think as we are the one thing that uh you can\nPoint out is that we have seen ten other period since the recovery began to mid two thousand nine when the ten year teen do the treasury bills\nUm yield jumped forty basis points or more and a six day period in each produced a nice tradable rally for bonds at a at least on sort of a near term basis but\nJust another way of saying the bond market is oversold and you also know this is when you see every CNBC ... ah talk more about treasuries and they do but the U.S will be five hundred or stocks so or the you know the ten year treasuries of measure that we look at you know quite often this is what's going to get a measure what's happening on that a ten year treasury that longer into the\nYield curve and they have been going a higher and they have broken a more a multi year high in fact a seven year high as where they are but I don't think we're looking for them to be materially higher from here three and a half percent that's that's certainly reasonable uh I think I Would be very surprised by something like four percent uh but I think you know the federal\nMain goal stocks rallied about two hundred percent over seven month period so I mean this is something that just other areas there are things that are cheap out there if people will take the time to look\nAnd usually what's been out of favor for a while is starting to show some at least some uh an attraction in terms of its disc out to where it's been so you know what you got to do your homework but there are things out there that are a good bargains\nAnd you know your timing about buying them is just scale into it if you don't know then you know what slowly scale into it some people have the temptation to go in and buy everything at once and then when it doesn't go their way they get aggravated ... emerging markets if we don't know what's gonna happen there gradually build your position overtime\nValuations are more compelling emerging markets but the trend is still negatively largely and they just I think people need to keep that in mind so I wouldn't go waiting in there just yet\nYou certainly should have some international exposure is not to say you shouldn't have gotten all out of it but to lower your waiting reduce your waiting very early this year which we'd advocated for I think it's still the call to make her a macro perspective from a fundamental perspective and that even a technical perspective\nYou call ... value stuck right now\nI think you'd have to call the value of the day you got to go to ... well there's lots of value stocks but you have to understand why are they a values yeah let's get the job of any might be a value so maybe it was ... or dead but they're going to you know the ... here's\nA is in serious trouble yeah JC penny I think will hang around um GE he's got that uh the dead cat bounce going on right now which is there a\nLot a you know I Would look for value stocks at a reasonably priced stable and have a buildup attractive to evidence you know having that you're confident that can hold I mean that's the at the end of the day gee lord so many people because of the er the cause of the field but look at a stock price yeah well\nThe reason Gerald electric cars that are nice we value called a ... mouth is one is that an ounce whatever new CEO very fundamental him that his strategy was much different I think an important [noise] um no it's not a value Plato hemorrhaging money by the way just to be clear and\nUm I think people just gotten more confident in the leadership the c._e._o. so I think that's add some recent upgrades some large White Houses above ... so some of the big banks have been putting on better better ratings on General Electric\nStock so you know [noise] just so they didn't wait for it to go with the cold so it is a little bit better

I Want to let people know that if you do want to document that gives you a lot about what to think about when you're considering preparing for retirement the decisions you need to be making at least posing some of the pros and cons of weighing these different decisions\nAnd then ultimately trying to execute it successful retirement you can simply go to our website and we produce a document called the retirement survival guide it's about ... pages long\nAnd it's a great dog goes with a lot of things about I Will say Mike we talk about so many times you can take one component of retirement like individual retirement accounts or or pensions and you can write volumes about these topics so it's not designed to give everything that you need to know about every topic\nBut it is I think it's going to propose a oppose the important questions or give these things to think about that are not just sort of people think about retirement they just didn't quantitative they just think the numbers\nBack to the napkin you know maybe some spreadsheets that kind of thing and that's how they get there\nBut it is much more than that it talks about how to prepare and other ways for retirement including medical expenses uh your mindset those kinds of things\nBut it's a great doctorate so what I Want to leave with that and you can get get that who obsess T wealth dot com and each week at our weekly
