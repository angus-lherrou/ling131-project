{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "PG Thirteen no play [noise]\nThanks [noise] done [noise] I'll talk to you later [noise] flown to the program\nGlad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating\nIs they're really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his you know really walked through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump someone from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a ... will\nIt really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times to visit the headline in\nThe New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em when we when that's when civility concert again\nUm there was another ... a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic ... what's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that they\nThis what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized drained but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable for the average person right they they won twice\nBased on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nosed as any other Democrat justice hard nose they at least tried to hide it this\nSwitch is now overt we're harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nParty and it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the ... that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X.\nThings might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nBack very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean people want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no 'cause you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people mhm right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is either they're horrible horrible and the people in the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist right like this\nVery few people were like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal\nHuman instinct and that's not even Nazis that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville right yeah yeah and everyone would say that that is terrific um but you know there was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and who's going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\nThey just won't recognize it ah and you know who won the leftist standing up against that\nWhose standing up and going oh we don't want to be you know that's not us we don't want to be a part of that\nThey just denied that it ever happened\nAnd it gives them this ability just to\n... indoors that\nSome smart in your smart speaker to lug so flaky pie or see on your grave you\nTonight ten nine central on

Wednesday and Thursday pretty brutal down last about fourteen hundred points became this morning to um some\nA tech sector rebounds banks had some earnings were pretty good and then just before noon a big sell off and now we're back positive territory again so what's going on\n... by the way uh you know what else was excited but\nMy fears excited today my hair is excited yeah it's kind of it's a little ... that ended up thing go have gotten to complement today a extra brought up so what do you call that a fade from uh that's what they call it that imminent man I'm sure I got up from two to a a good looking I yeah I think that\nIt was pretty nice as well as well I'm happy to see what is it ... it is as well as getting columnist like that's going to get happier you do have nice here\nUh by the way you were yelling at a Johanna when I walked in I was kind of rude she just trying to bring issues nice somebody's birthday or trying to show\nWell you know she was distracting\nHouse trying to bring the food in here you know what happened was Joe nice to talk about how nice he feels excited about the nice weather and the weekend he's going to be going through and you got to start or shall we got to skip and a step\nBecause you have nice here doesn't mean you can treat people who are like I said I'll skip spring I get a tip I thought you said okay I'll skip I break scotch\n... you're going to hopscotch ... well that you're going to explain what the market's doing right now ...\nYou know you know what I heard somebody say the markets soaring this morning I thought it was max and Thursday was sore and yeah I looked over up a less than one percent of that story now and it's called the big fell off global big sell off you know so yeah well it's a it's kind of a lame rebound\nAbout that it's you know rebound you would expect that a technical basis I mean look how far down at came at such a short period of time and so it rebounds a little bit uh I think you just sort of have to have a little bit of a wait and see here\nIf you're talking just large cap you know domestic equities I don't think that you can say that we've broken any major bullish trends um if you're kind of looking back over a longer period of time\nOr you can certainly say on the small caps in the mid caps you've broken two hundred a moving average I think that's something that's so notable you'd want to get them back above that and see where it sort of a settles out of it is not you know you should have already if you've done so you should have already position your portfolio for a rising interest rate environment\nHigher credit quality shorten the duration of the portfolio you would have been you would have been mitigating the risks of arising interesting Barbara hopefully on the individual bonds and a ear mindful of what you own and why you own it\nOn the equity side you know hopefully you've been less on the international side you certainly been under weight on the emerging markets\nA since January February under domestics largely still constructive probably fully way it but just more skewed towards the more defensive sectors the more the less cyclical sectors like we've been in for a while technology and consumer discretionary sectors and others\nBecause that's what you're going to see in sort of early and later as sort of early in the peak stages of the business cycle\nI think you can make a reasonable argument where at least it sort of in the seventh inning or so that you're going to be in the sectors that all the more defensive paying higher dividends a bully and they're going to outperform the consumer staples stocks or even some of the utilities are those stocks are now perform so I think that's it's exactly where you should\nI'll just say broadly largely be a physician showed a oh so you shouldn't be doing anything drastic at this point to react to you know what's going on to the market or last couple of days I think it's now it's a little bit of a dust settling period you should kind of wait and see how things shake out\nI'm On the short term it's definitely deteriorated from the technical but a longer and then talk about the domestic socks\nDomestic large ... five hundred doubt you had not seen still a a great deterioration in the long term ...\nWell I'm Glad it happened and I'll tell you for this reason maybe a few weeks ago I talked to somebody you know they're looking around talking to different advisers and this person's a a baby boomer and I'm not kidding you they have Facebook and apple is the two stocks that he has and its portfolio for a pretty significant amount of his network\nAnd you know what the untouchable is what I call them those that have been in the ... the momentum stocks out there and they're thinking well nothing nothing bad can happen you know and I got the kind of well you know not such a good job even if I'm Down or you know it's not going to be that bad well you know I I I I'm always shocked at how many people have forgotten the lessons\nOf two thousand eight and then especially those that were in tech stocks in two thousand\nGo back and tell me a ... you know oh if I lost a little bit I wouldn't be that bad I mean people lost everything they gained back that don't think that can't happen so you got to be careful and I would if I was over the weekend if I was you I Would go look at your statements log in yet logged in awhile reset your password have sent back to you and you can reset it\nGet in there and go and look at your portfolio isn't and find out what happened how does it look what does the percentage at ... now what is the attribution of that and just look at the overall a downside of your portfolio and ask yourself the question am I okay with that and if you're not\nThey'll do anything drastic now but you need to begin to figure out how you position yourself defensively if you don't like the results of what you saw because this is a nice little warning sign and you know what probably more to come but take us a warning and make sure you adjust and react appropriately\nAt the reason I'm not overly concerned at this point I'm is what has fundamentally changed this week\nWe're going to get her earnings obviously coming in so far we've seen some of the financial stocks the bank city group or poor as of this morning we'll talk a little bit about that um what's fundamentally changed\nNews of a trade news of trade tensions are the Federal Reserve is they've kind of scripted out their end of the year and then the next year or interest rate hikes um you know the rolling off of their balance sheet what's fundamentally change\nI I don't think raising fundamentalist change that we didn't already know going into the week so I don't think that's the reason so again I kind of puts me back to you know you should already of that position you know what's you should know what your own and why you own it going into the weak and nothing that happened this week is fundamentally change\nWill look at the ... the technicals in the end of the week it's always good to sort of a pause point to look at what happened during the week we're still on track for a pretty poor weak overall for stocks even with a a little bit of bounce day\nAs we could as it is still a financial stocks primarily the larger banks began reporting this morning by the way including Citigroup\nUh they said it's third quarter profits rose twelve percent from a year ago the company cut expenses or loses tax bill ever the flat revenue growth missed on the revenues so the company shares rose about three and a half percent early morning but overall financials if you look back over the the whole week by the way makes up to what these banks and financial makeup twenty three percent\nOf the value category the value group\nFinancial represent ... percent and they're not exactly like the look alike market leaders even with rising interest rates was generally thought of as being a better environment for bank so it's particularly discouraging when you see the financial stocks\nWere using the biggest beneficiaries of rising bond yields not doing so well I Am so we'll continue to discuss this challenging market the week and we may mean for you and your money headed website sta wealth dot coms register weekly newsletter what shows up must come down is this week's topic\nTimely I might have had a ... a TA money out [noise]\nNine fifty years look better sudden and Mike Smith also pretty difficult starts with a fourth quarter of\nYear two thousand Eighteen we had a basically ended the third quarter\nNoah largely up the year on stocks particularly the United states large cap a Denver early well yes and he was up essentially double digits internationally down for the year\n... emerging markets down double digits for the year bonds down for the year the only sort of thing it was hanging out there those positive and maybe it was like well the market's doing great was the U.S will be five hundred the Dow Jones industrial average\nAnd even a few months ago a in several weeks ago in fact you could go back to the deterioration in fact we were writing about it in the weekly commentary the technical commentary about some of the ... factors and the uh small\nOf space which is just really kind of uh the the leader I think generally in large caps generally follow we've seen sort of more deterioration there we've written about that as of late ... was more closely with the last few weeks\nAnd the cyclical stocks are we talked about the retailers\nAnd I'm just only a few weeks ago talking about the market beginning loose some momentum and these large kept sort of discretionary stocks and a and even the retailers and what that might mean and so this week we're seeing how the market's reacting obviously the last few days of the poor but it's really been going back a little bit farther than that\nWe talked about the with some of the economic data or I mean it's largely good but there are some things not to love all the uh on the manufacturing front or the um I think even globally we're seeing a bit of a slow down a it's a ... the United\nStates sort of fully operate the couple or from the rest of the world from an economic performance standpoint because uh you know we're going to have a hard time maintaining three and four percent growth when the rest of the year old world and our trading partners and buying a trading partners are not performing all that well\nSo there's definitely challenges ahead and we talk about many of those things are in the weekly newsletter some of these high tech names and sort of the change of direction we we talk about those are valuations we talk about earnings growth all that in this week's letter in fact\nThey have to you know the stock price of words then that might be an argument but no it's not it's not a value play again that's relative to earnings and\nYou know and relative to the sectors that relative to its historical prices and expected growth lots of things so it's a relative to the game I guess is what I'm saying so not a value play in the case of Syria is not a value play in the case of General Electric cars this\nKind of like if you're losing blood you can drink all the orange juice you want but it's not going to save your life my tastes really good but near the kind of like that yeah but not really\n[laughter] have you got to stop at\nNothing really like that you got to stop the bleeding that's my point they're bleeding too much cash\nSo you should drink a lot of orange juice you if you own General Electric yeah that's what I'm hearing I don't know I was going to have\nJust a layman's analogy ... lead the leader for that so you know life you know the not so big brain listeners they got what I meant\nThey're wondering what we'll talk about that offer for anyway Heather was funny editor website as well that golf register for the weekly newsletter what goes up was that what goes up must come down as the title this week's newsletter and we live at more at their website sta wealth dot com [noise]\nIn a sour Pete envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shopping you probably heard these terms\nWhat do they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from two car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true craft shows you what other people are paying for the council\nYou are listening to the U. S. T. A. money our need help with your money calm I can look no seven one three two one\nFifty well started the fourth quarter quarters are pretty difficult we obviously seen uh the markets selling off quite a bit this week if you go back about end of last\nYear and you track the S. and the five hundred to retract that against you know the rest of the world index like ex United States both developed in emerging markets\nA track very closely to one another in fact when you got in the may June\nIt began to deviate you saw the S. and the rod hire you saw the rest of the world and the global disease\nX United States go lower\nIt looked like alligator jaws you know they sort of get that visual mind um that's an algae see like that's an analogy I think people can go with that I can relate to what was your name drinking orange juice or lawyers and owning General Electric\nYet and then you feel better and bleeding and not losing blood and drinking orange juice yeah I'm not sure I Can't remember what the alligator adjusts to get it yeah alligator jobs out there and why do you see the divergence chart and you can imagine are alligator jaws one chart sort of line going up one going down I'm\nMax you didn't like are you just kind of ... have a little fun with a buddy will hurt I mean actually hurt it's okay I mean he's been skipping ahead and thicker skinned drinking orange juice and leaves him but he maybe should drink while giving fishy drink orange juice\n[laughter] as you're diagnosed yes 'cause we're back in the studio or maybe that's why you guys are all cocky and everything we're uncomfortable [laughter] ah but what was my point\nIs is that now are saying that it was you know there was the divergence so long for so for such a period of time and and actually had pretty significantly I mean you saw what stocks had done a in January\nAnd February we saw the sell off I mean it was up almost double digits right off the bat in January and of course we saw steep sell off all global stocks acted the same\nAnd then ... it up until about may and June and then we saw divergence we saw us ... perform well and ultimately got through again be about up double digits for the year and we saw international activities were down in fact uh the do develop international is down about\nCertainly a correction period\nFor a a big part of that and the emerging markets essentially but em bear market or from their highest down double digits for the year one of the big drivers uh we've been saying\nGlobal liquidity\nInterest rates were still relatively low and it was driven by technology name specifically a six names and that was just sort of a theme we kept reminding people yes the market is up as if he was up six or seven or eight percent at one time and we kept saying you know the first half of the year\nOver Ninety percent of the games and the U.S will be five hundred was because of the technology stocks\nEighty five percent of the games and the market was due to just\nSix names within the technology sector of course that was a fang stocks and the Facebook the apple and Amazon Netflix Google broke down early\nWhich they did break down and ultimately because you know that can't last forever that sort of concentration of returns doesn't usually end well it's always in short term ball to leave that again back to our point earlier show that to be expected\nThat is to be expected so now you're seeing the correlation tighten up quite a bit between what's happening and I'd states and emerging stark so emerging markets and I'll say the other thing we kept saying in writing about and saying almost every show because people will say well now the time to get back international because we ... we would make the point\nBe you know risk averse and we were sick people to caution themselves against staying out of the international particularly the emerging markets now you should own some\nBut be underweight underway underway and we kept saying going to be a good offer ... well that was the point I was getting too so that we're going to say it's going to become and create a good opportunity but not yet decided to get we just said that she again yesterday\nIt will be creating opportunity but not yet\nAnd so during this time and what we saw in the tech stocks we saw what a second leg down an emerging markets as international names are a little bit of a balance today not a big one I Would say kind of a lame one mild one if you will a little bit of recovery uh but he has to be expected we saw\nI mean when the Dow Jones goes even at this level twenty six twenty seven thousand and it's down fourteen hundred points in two days that's a big relatively good move for two days that's an oversold position\nI don't think people you know that's go ahead and start buying these tech names going or they give themselves okay how's the time to buy Facebook it's off twenty six percent okay so we're talking about today but it's off twenty six percent ... first she was a dead cat valves\nYou've heard of that that ... you turn on this one guy\nI'm just saying it's referred to as what we're saying I Know other analogy for max max what do\nYou watch your parents script says we only one that I got his\nHair cut and asking me if I Know what a dekalb and I've got a scripted analogy with music or some orange juice I suppose I don't know my point is is actually good\nThat we have been sort of revisiting the divergence between us equity is large cap and what's been happening internationally and caution caution people that it's now not yet now is not yet up to to take advantage of the prices are emerging markets and so people say well now the time started jumping into Facebook and Netflix and Google amateur beat it not yet\nNot yet so we're going to see how that shakes out a little bit I think it's worth a in the ... you know we see valuations where they are and we see earnings I think you're arguably Pete", "year": "2018",
