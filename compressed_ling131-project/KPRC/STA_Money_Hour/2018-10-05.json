and I don't know it's just it's it's just a chess\nGame was going to be with you know this differences and I know this is a lot to do with socialism particularly I'm really wait on these this is what a lot of this is about any way but you just talking about the political landscape right now sort of the populism that's sort of bubbled up with the one side and then and then on the other side is much more blatant socialism\nAnd I I'll tell you what I mean people talk about the economic fallout from two thousand and eight I think there is very much an elliptical fallout from that and I would even as a geopolitical fallout\nWill put took place in the in two thousand eight financial crisis I mean it was a global financial crisis I think people have lost faith and free markets and much of the world most commonly that you've seen that I think you know generally has been well received and has been a part of their success\nWhat about that on the next segment because I think the underlying economy is saying one thing the market I think has gotten a little bit of\nA lot of that's good news priced in in it even did so well before the tax cuts were passed and we talked about that again\nBut all in all has been very constructive no major trends had been disrupted but the S. and P. five hundred it had really hasn't moved material materially in two months we made some recent highs particularly on the Dow Jones industrial average\nBut I think that you know this is consistent with the idea that profit profit growth will slow next year\nA and that is a narrative of the acceleration the bulls and I think that that is something that you just have to keep in mind that we've been talking about we've had some great benefits from the tax policy and your your earnings growth I think next year some of that is not to be expected\nAnd we even ... wrote in this week's newsletter and if it came out Tuesday and if you go to the website and haven't registered for I think it'd be worthwhile looking at it why do we talk about interest rates\nWere talking about interest rates and where they may mean for you so we talk about that they are in the newsletter button weekly technical comments we talk about the retail sector you were talking about the consumer my\nRetail Stark's stocks I think I have a pretty bad chart had them here they falling the lowest level in two months they were trained below the fifty they moving average it's all there for you and the picture that you can see 'em and uh we see the selling might not be a just a little bit here in the short

year treasury yields three point two percent just over that yesterday and today is the highest level by the way since may two thousand eleven\nAnd it's been quite some time since we've seen those higher yields we've tested that area before two thousand Thirteen fourteen\nUh and more recently even around the three percent range for a while but it finally got above that three point won three point to level and is there now so it's a bit of a game changer but as far as we know we talked about that pretty extensively yesterday Mike about\nHow these interest rates move interest rate movements or may affect bonds\nTalked a little bit about the differences between bond funds and individual bonds and sort of a how interesting it affects those but also some of the differences again between those two are ways to invest in fixed income but the u._s. stock market I think is going to be continue to be tested by these rising bond yields for the rest of the year\nUh yields are definitely going to be a challenge for stocks are certainly this core the two the two most important factors in stock prices really are earnings\nAnd interest rates and now the earnings this year they were fantastic\nBut the good news is out\nIn the ten year treasury three point two percent or its highest level against us may do thousand\nThe the latest reading a bright still their right to report to change Macs are you there [noise]\nUm but I think basically you know you've seen this you've seen the little bit of rotation recently out of the some of the cyclical stocks and the more defense of names you see the yields creeping hire\nA inflation greet them a little bit higher you see the headwinds of things like monetary policy became less accommodate of um I think we may have seen the ... for a little while I'm In terms of a ... year over year growth especially\nSo I think those are going to be had ones where people for a little while we've been constructive on the economy people knows largely were constructive here domestically we have not been as constructive\nUh internationally and particularly in emerging markets in fact we've been under way that we've been talking and writing about that are giving sort of our rationale for it but what that means that it's going to create some opportunities\nAre so we'll but people it'll maybe lightened up early this year on things like emerging markets the international space it will create an opportunity they're just not yet\nWell even lighten up on us stocks and then you had a great year or last year I mean you had a pretty decent year and some of the factors\nBut it doesn't say now if you were being defensive like you're talking about a shorter term you and you're getting a rate of return you get three percent is not a not a bad right of return I mean again if right now if you look at this over inflation you got to you're basically treasuries yielding higher than inflation I mean when's the last time you saw that happens so\nYou know if I was an investor and I've been doing pretty well I mean taking a little off the table and putting it aside and something that's going to give you you'll while you pivot and white to wear to reallocate that because I think uh I think you're right I think these yields are going to create volatility\nUm you know and think about this the context of the rest of the world I think you're going to continue to strengthen the dollar in in the simple reason ban look at where capital wants to go if you look around the rest of the world what we're a hundred and Seventy\nBasis points above the German boom that is one of the widest spreads we've seen so attract capitals going to look for stability and currency which is the dollar and where it can find a yield and argue there's even more attractive than it was several weeks ago so\nFly to Capitol still comes here and keeps our dollar strong and ... again I think it's going to be a a really a bad thing for the emerging markets for at least the short term but I agree\nDown the road if I was somebody that with a long time span or if you look at the proportion your portfolio that's longer term I Would start doing research and knowing which emerging markets managers or however you going to play that you're going to come back into 'cause it's gonna be a lot cheaper to that is\nTo that well you see the ex our T which is the
