now number one it\nWas a media member specifically that was targeted in this with CNN getting one of the packages and number two obviously\nUh the uh the the chance to kind of blame this broadly

lower interest rate you could say five hundred thousand dollars or more\nWow so your credit card bills can roll into your mortgage yes they can\nAnd your student loans and particularly\nWell that

Hughes and Charles call your in particular that have some thoughts about other areas when families think about what it means to have wealth veteran important to measure on your family's balance sheet\nSo the for things that I kind of think about a one of which is that that you know the financial capital but the other three are\nHuman capital the relationships in your family uh aren't important component of what it means to have family wealth\nAnd understanding that the value that you place on the the health of a relationship between whether it's a parent and child or between siblings or is just as important to measure that\nEarlier this year I did a show um because I had just ... I went to a conference and I'd read the book before you probably heard the about the book rich dad port Asher ikea Psaki and I was talking about\nThe types of things it had nothing to do with money the intellectual capital of the human ... you were talking about is what teaches a person to fish not just receiving the Fisher\nAbs absolutely know that the\nIdea of you know human capital covers a lot of things of the health of the relationships the talents in calling within the family or not just\nThe the type of calling that produces a lot of financial wealth but just that people are lined with what they're good at and what makes them the person they are and they're able to go out and have the freedom to pursue those things and then you mentioned intellectual capital ah education is is the obvious one but work ethic\nOr do we have a sense of what it means to go out every day and be a productive person and in whatever it is that we're passionate about or a spiritual life you know ... whether you're involved and\nWherever you worship you know having something in your life that allows you to to find more value than just adding up the numbers every day\nOr the family history family mission and you know some families are good about particularly if there's\nMultigenerational wealth thinking about how do we communicate\nTo multiple generations the story of our family and I think that's important when we start to get into work and I talk about you know maybe some negative situations with families and a lot of families that have negative situations maybe don't understand\nThe family history super well and are aren't rooted in the story of what brought them to where they are today\nA social capital is another category\nOr are you involved in the community\nAre you active and and the causes that allow your community to uh become more vibrant overtime and that may be political involvement charitable involvement but all those other categories are just as important to the the family wellbeing as the financial Balanchine\nWell by having the financial balance sheet and having a balance between the human intellectual and also a desire for social capital that really is a great recipe if it's done well from the you know the the top generation to have really good family legacy planting\nThat's a that's exactly right that's exactly right I think when you put all that together\nThe financial components of family wealth are extremely important\nAnd they allow you to leverage the other areas of the families balance you if you haven't put all of those things in their proper place I think it's much harder for the balance sheet aspect of what do we do particularly if you're a family that's asking yourself the question\nLook I I Know I'm not going to need all this during my life\nHow do I set my kids and their kids up for that type of plan that's going to allow them to really benefit from the wealth we've created\nAnd not be hurt by it and asking yourself how does your financial balance sheet fit into leveraging those other areas of family wealth is a really important question I think\nWell I think it's really good and if you have all those things and you're really good about teaching a really good about education many wealthy families are very big on education and you put maybe I'm a family off this together a very good team of advisors\nThat gives you the ability to really make sure that that wealth isn't just gone and the next generation I mean both of us and we've talked about these wars stories we've seen significantly wealthy families\nThat have quote trust them babies have terrible kids we've also seen families when families here in Houston they've had a wealth for generations yeah that's right and the big rich book you know by the Texas oil fan right as as some of them are a mess and some of them are um fantastic shape\nOne thing they all had was money\nStrength some of them didn't have a good balance and some of those other areas\nYeah no that's right I I think when you think oh a good situation uh you you generally have senior members of whoever the wealth creators are that are actively\nInvolved and thinking about how is my wealth going to impact the next generation and the generation after that uh if if if we get to the point where we're asking those questions and you have someone who's active in teaching the next generation ah it's it's really really helpful\nWhen we get back what I Want to do is I Want to talk about some great stories about the good the bad and the ugly a family wealth a wealth planning we'll talk about that as soon as we get back [noise]\n\n[noise] no back to the FDA money our on TV or see nine fifty here's a little better so\nFast like today is ...

S. T. A. money our need help with your money called my can look no seven one three two one\nFive games along with Scott bishop financial planning for sta will management our special guest them for the worker who's an attorney with gray read\nAnd a specialist in family wealth planning I'm loving this topic I Can't wait to get the uh the bad stuff but we talked about a lot of the good stuff but you know what they say in news and in radio if it\nBleeds it leads so the best for laughs saving the last ... hours but what's the worst but you know sometimes I always say you can learn a lot from your successes but most people learn more from their failures absolutely\nAnd I work with a lot of wealthy families here are sta wealth in one of the things that I Do is when I'm going through issues actually sometimes talk with my clients about some of the issues that I'm dealing with\nAnd sometimes through their experiences they can give me some really good feedback so let's talk about\nSome of the things ban or that we know from our experiences the bad and the ugly ... let's talk a little bit about where people fall short in their planning and how it impacts the family\nSure I I think that the general term that you hear often and in our world is that a family who creates wealth statistically often loses it within two generations so that the terminology is shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves and three generations\nAre sometimes and other countries there's a different way of of putting it depending on what the primary economic activity is in that country but it's kind of a worldwide concept that you see people\nCreate wealth in one generation and then over the next generation maybe the kids are able to maintain it to some degree\nBut by the time it gets down to the third generation something has happened that has not enabled the third generation to keep that well well\nI Do a lot of speaking on family businesses and closely held businesses and and the data for the last fifty years supports it is the first generation of whatever generation is that starts a business typically it's the second generation that tries to grow the business because\nThey already know payrolls all already being met the first generation had to starve to meet payroll the second generation um learn to grow up because they already had a financial base and it's the third generation that kills it there's about five to ten percent of all businesses that make it to a third generation\nRight it's it's a I I think when you have particularly families have great wealth\nThe first generation creates that wealth through a type of philosophy in lifestyle that I think to some degree gets ingrained in their own children and the next generation\nAnd those children often have a sense of how to deal with the wealth when it comes to their generation and they've seen it done right they've seen it done right and assuming you had kind of a healthy interaction there\nUh but often as the third generation grows up and that household the second generation is not as pro active\nIn teaching the next generation about what it means to have this wealth to Stuart ... and how to do it right\nAnd it's also a broader generation Soviet three kids and they have three kids you're dealing with a much broader ... business a group of\nFamilies but maybe with that training you were talking about between the first and second maybe that some of the reason we hear about people with state wealth whether it be through inheritance without proper training we actually what we just had that South Carolina lottery that all over a trillion dollars that people one what are the odds of that person's going to have success without running\nUp a billionaire thing a billion ... and not a trillion a billion a trillion it'd be nice to have a truly would be nice that would be a little bit life altering it would be a life altering a but it's a perfect example of\nWhen you really have to think about how these things work in practice if you had someone that stepped into that amount of wealth immediately\nMaybe you're having these issues in the first generation because you have someone who has never maybe had access to any level of wealth other than living off paycheck to paycheck so you know that dynamic is is unique but I think generally\nThere's a couple of obvious situations where you're going to have some bad some bad facts the first one that that I often think about is is when your team as we started to talk about a second ago when your team is\nYou know less than adequate for whatever reason your team of of advisors I should say\nThat's where we often see problems that turn into unnecessary conflict and cost so you may have and maybe on the legal side and there's a lot of people that operate in my world and they dabble in certain areas of the wall\nAnd today's world is so complex that\nIt's hard to hire somebody and have them be competent if that's not a specialty for them they're just too much going on and all these different areas of the law\nThat if you're hiring someone who has been your business advisor for a long time on the legal side and they draft up some simple estate planning documents for you that may not be a good idea\nAnd that may lead to some issues that we often deal with and so that that's a perfect example of where we see some bad is not intentional but just somebody who doesn't do that very often", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
