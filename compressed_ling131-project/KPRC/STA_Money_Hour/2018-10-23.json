just had the most amazing conversation off air we were talking about what we were talking about a minute ago and\nSex and gender and I said look sex is what you were born with and gender is how you feel that was the term and I actually said this that was the term as I understood it about three weeks ago now maybe it has changed\nI think of that we ...\nWe're trying to have serious conversations about things and people are changing and taking away meanings of words without really explaining what all of that means and you're in trouble if you don't know what it means\nThis is in Santa isn't Saturday I mean and this this could beat this could be a knock like you could be a critical critic and say this\nHey you know what gender coming from your brain not the body or is it between your ears are not your legs\nThat that can be a conservative criticizing the new understanding of gender instead of their explanation of it [noise]\nI did and I don't know how that is different from what we've been saying the whole time and they will try to get that answer tomorrow mine\nThemselves go everywhere I go to Google it could be or see on my heart radio um\nDid you know that the average household pays nearly Thirteen hundred dollars in credit card interest every year Thirteen hundred dollars\nThat doesn't include the credit card ballots now is this applies to you I Want you know there is relief especially if you're a homeowner I'm here with Gabby mold in auto she's the co founder of American financing tell me about debt consolidation Gabby\nWell credit card carry him in a higher interest rates around\nYou're going to be looking at a Fifteen Percent interest rate which is about what a mortgage rate currently is that's why I recommend mortgage refinancing can sound like I said that it works that combining multiple back into one came in at a lower interest rate you could say five hundred thousand dollars or more\nSo the credit card bills roll into your mortgage\nYes they can and and your student loans and personally\nIf I re fi does that mean I have to start out with another thirty your mortgage\nUp all ... if I may I'll go back to ... wonder if some of them are more recent writings October eleventh are newsletter and titled what goes up must come down\n[noise] okay so we talk about it we we talk about the day more today show and revisit those concepts I think it's important uh this is not a panic thing no one uh we see now this will be the third time we get a five percent to ten percent move to the down side and the equity markets the U.S will be five hundred\nThat's right at the historical average this has nothing unusual I Do however think there are some challenges ahead as we are in a good earnings season in fact you see it doesn't matter\nA caterpillar ... are released this morning revenue beats earning beat by a penny a sold off\nThree am not such good performance bad execution UCLA second quarter row basically laid an egg and a three and perform poorly pretty poorly but both are detracting from the U.S and they see the Dow Jones industrial average again the uh the what we talked about Tobar letter in a weekly technical commentary we talk about the NASDAQ one hundred\nThe technology space leading the market lower now would not necessarily what surprised you always speak to that because it's been such a market leader for such a long period of time what are the heirs we said do require I think some attention or the small and mid cap indexes they were at that time trading below the two hundred a averages\nAnd the S. and P. at that time fell below it's fifty day line\nSo we were talking about that so again the title the October eleventh letter what goes up what must come down\nThen we then after that the October Fifteen we saw the market to track four percent on that week in fact it was down and had a rally friday otherwise would have been worse and this week we're just seeing a little bit more sell off down around two percent of the day uh she's been on this week now for the broad market\nNow it's not been one day and as I said early although we had two days in a row last week where we've lost a full five percent\nNow that's not the end of the world we have a little while 'til they again it's expected but we are in fact given up most of all of the year to date games and the S P five hundred bucks for two thousand Eighteen the one thing I Want to put your mind before but you're back to you\nThe wicked technical commentary of this fact this last October sixteenth letter [noise]\nWe talk about an abrupt markets sell off should investors care but what I really want to ... to remind them of is the week the technical commentary we talk about\nThe title a more serious warning well this is one we saw the twenty they exponential moving average move below the fifty day that's just one of what we can do their signal that indicates a shorter term bearish cross another so often stocks may carry more serious warning signs\nAnd again not to be redundant but to re emphasize again the small and mid calf stocks we outlined the charts there they still rate remain and still do this day well below their two hundred eight lines so did the ATF we're tracking real estate communications industrial materials and financial stocks\nAll of them below their two hundred eight lines and if you look at the breath that we've been talking about weeks now things are beginning to change\nAnd in fact it's to the downside you're seeing more use it to a hundred of the ... five hundred stocks of the five hundred stocks in that index two hundred of those are in fact in bear market territory over twenty percent doubt or more\nOkay we've been talking about this for well over a week now\nAh and then ... and then uh you know you just see stocks more and more and you are being doubt Seventy four percent of the stocks in the recipe five hundred right now or in corruption territory in other words being defined as down ten percent or more from the highs and again the NASDAQ has down ten percent so it's not all terrible this is somewhat to be expected\nShould you be reacted this week no should you have reacted last week no should you have positioned yourself a little bit differently in the weeks leading up to this yeah yes\nYeah you should have been we've been talking about that what kind of add into the the whole point should you be overreacting absolutely not as a matter of fact going back for a day to just been through two thousand nine looking in essence ... five hundred corrections were were great basically now eight and a half percent over the last thirty two days now it feels worst right because it feels worst because it has not happened for such a long period time\nBut this is right in line with the average market pull back since March two thousand nine so if you want to know what the average right now thirty two days the average has been forty two if you look at the decline on average just nine point three percent were down a point five percent and if you want to look at the ball to volatility index the VIX peak\nOn average is thirty two we're here at twenty eight to keep in mind just remember\nThis market is transitioning away from predictable liquidity that's been provided by central banks that is what we've been accustomed to we've been talking about this for at least several years that this would actually come to heat at some point and I believe going into next year that is going to get more and more apparent so this is going to be towards more fundamental driven markets\nMarkets that have uncertainty and it's because of the divergence look at what's going on a trade policy\nThat equals guess what volatility so your investment applications are\nYou're gonna see sectors that are going to switch we talked about going from growth devalue we've seen that you better have a greater respect for liquidity risk in your portfolio is this is what we've been talking about for quite some time in ... basically going back to an active management style in versus a pastor style if you've been in a passive style\nCongratulations hopefully you've done well but you really need to be looking to implement and not all of it maybe not all of your portfolio but having some active management\nHaving some non correlated assets in there if you haven't done so already than I mean I'm not saying it's too late but you need to get a little bit move a little bit quicker you've had plenty of time to get ready but if not you need to and I'll tell you I had this last\nCheapen some Dr powder or for a you know add into a you know exposure later on and that could not it's not money market you can buy treasury you mentioned earlier to your treasuries almost at three percent again ... two year treasury above the inflation rate when are we seeing that so that's a good opportunity\nSo those are some things to remember a lot of change going on and volatility is here to stay\nA lot of change well I mean look I think you can expect this more normal volatility in an environment that is basically shifting and were served cigarette regime change a little bit uh especially the rights of Federal Reserve in this case I'll say more globally central bank policy\nHere in the United states the Federal Reserve is beginning to withdraw some of the liquidity shrink its balance sheet and raise interest rates it doesn't mean that stocks cannot go and have not gone up historically as interest rates are much higher but I think the other story really is at a little bit out of\nChina and it's not the trade impact if the slowing growth six and a half percent at the slowest growth that scene in a decade and an overall we see them now as a\nEnormous economy around
