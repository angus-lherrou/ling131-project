I I had\nDid you know that the average household pays nearly Thirteen hundred dollars in credit card interest every year Thirteen hundred dollars\nThat doesn't include the credit card ballots now is this applies to you I Want you know there is relief especially if you're a homeowner I'm here with Gabby mold in auto she's the co founder of American financing tell me about debt consolidation Gabby\nCredit card carrying a higher interest rates around\nYou're going to be looking at Fifteen Percent interest rate which is about oh what a mortgage rate currently is that's why I recommend mortgage refinancing can not again that it works that combining multiple back into one came in at a lower interest rate you could think five hundred thousand dollars or more\nSo the credit card bills roll into your mortgage\nAnd your student loans and particularly\nIf I re fi does that mean I have to start out with another thirty your mortgage\nBut some members make it at that an American anything we don't have to read that you're going to you can you can get cleaner Eighteen here than any anytime you need if your mortgage your way\nAre there any other benefits to refinancing your mortgage right now\nAre you can drop mortgages lower your interest rate you can take cash out kind of trickled and at Saturday's mortgage control in the book how can they can make that happen\nLeading indicator of small cap stocks and smoke up stocks have obviously been down to the month are down ... over five percent for the month of October already and they have been a sort of on a steady decline which will get into also but the big increases that we've seen for the first half of the year ... how long did we go on emphasizing the people\nThe concentration of the gains in the S. and P. to essentially six names so those bank stocks Facebook apple Amazon Netflix Google Plus Microsoft\nA and technology generally made up Ninety five percent of the games the first half of the year for the U.S will be five hundred that is so much concentration in one sector\nThose six names made up over eighty eighty five percent of the games and the S. and P. firing all the weight so it was carrying a lot of the way for just in those six names those things I think we'll even said you know I made the comment\nThis kind of concentration does it end well now we've talked constructively about the economy I mean I think there's reason to be generally constructive still on the U.S economy but we've also talked about the differences between what's going on the United states economy and what's happening abroad developed international the emerging markets and we've been talking about the emerging markets when we talk about all the time but\nThis year we've been much more defensive and we been encouraging people to be more defensive\nAnd the international in particular the emerging markets base him frankly ... we've been under weight that area a ourselves\nSo we see look you take underweight you build a cash position at some point\nYou become that becomes an opportunity and we talked about the rotation of those things\nUm and so a lot of that's been playing out we basically had a rolling correction again if you see the S. and P. five hundred down as you mentioned about one and a half percent today the Dow or ... points by one and a half percent on the day a and we've had a roller corruption like I said it started with a small kept stocks over last couple of months\nNow we're getting the mega caps the big ones that were so much of these gains have been concentrated the corrections sort of role\nAnd now we're finally getting these big names and ah the big so off that we're seeing in the name so we talked about Facebook Netflix and apple Amazon\nOr above the semi conductors now those technologies stocks down three point four percent now fallen more than seven percent since the start of October names tied the global growth like caterpillar and all those others have been also a getting hit pretty good uh but telecoms\nUtilities the traditional defensive sectors hire\nSome steady consumer products like a an even those stocks were also in the grain a today and we see like Johnson Johnson Philip\nMorris the healthcare ... I mean\nMacs back me up here we talked about the seventh inning it's more of a later cycles sector rotation you might get an early we're talking about this now for a couple of months you may get in there a little bit early but I think it was a time to not get out of stocks but understand where we are in the business cycle and the kinds of sectors in stocks performed better\nUh in certain stages of the business cycle so if you think that we're in the early stages\nWhich would be hard to believe that you might think that after being in this stage for the longest like live astronaut right for nine years\nUh it's hard to see where it would be in the early stages which would you know that would say that's where you want to be in this consumer discretionary stocks of circles that technology names and even in sort of as you begin to peak this technology names and those other separate goals\nCan still be good places to be but as you get longer and the business cycle and later in the evenings so to speak that's when you want to think about some of the health care name some of the energy names\nSome of these others are more defense of sectors like telecommunications and or even utilities\nAnd these names have obviously been out performing those others become more defensive it doesn't mean go all out or go all in but I think this is again the concentration of these names were something that was with his arrest\nAnd the and you see some of the bankruptcies or in the retail space again a very cyclical type sector right consumers are strong feeling good and confident they're going to go out and buy a a lot of goods and they're going to do that and those retail names but then the sectors that have seen a look a little downside has been the retailers\nAnd in fact we wrote about that in our weekly newsletter recently we were talking about that very topic\nA in fact if you go back to the November twenty seventh letter\nWe talk about as the fed announces another rate hike because we talked about the the rest right now people are talking about the trade issues with China yes that's a potential risk but the real risk is with the Federal Reserve is going to do we we we talk about it we back it up\nBut we talk about also the investors should be watching other risks are and not just sort of the trade issues not just for the Federal Reserve is doing\nBut there are other risks in fact so we talk about these arrests like corporate debt the leverage the margin dead many of these earnings are issues have been coming up some of the negative guidance has been coming up complacency about the strong economy investors becoming pretty greedy\nPretty confident and we talked about the fear and greed index all of that in our November twenty seventh newsletter in fact we also talk about the ten year treasury yields that challenge at that time the three percent level and now it's a three point to in change so we talked about yields going higher\nOr in this December she'd be October third letter we talked about were interest rates are going but we talked about in the ... the the technical commentary sector we talked about the retail sector and it was stumbling at that time as a two month low\nI'm reading right off of the newsletter the bullet points and the title page consumer circles are losing that upside momentum\nRight there and we talk about that the cyclical sectors ones that we're talking about getting hit today and have been now for these ... ah this last week and a half especially\nAlso losing the leadership role we talk about consumer discretion also losing ground against the consumer staples therefore the more defense of names\nAnd we also speak again in there about small caps and sort of being the potential canary in the coal mine and I'm not saying this is going to be the next financial crisis and next thing that kind of rolls over in terms of a big bear market\nI don't think that's likely the case but to consider how you can better position yourself to not lose money you know in a very volatile way and to position yourself for the portfolio outperform longer term it makes it's reasonable to consider where we are in the business cycle and to position your portfolio accordingly that's all what we're saying\nAnd it's making sense it's coming it's it's it's sort of playing out in real time well you guys are good [noise] well\nLike I mean it's the discipline we're gonna come back and talk about this month we're going to talk more about this Russian our things are going it will create a better buying opportunity but it may not be hitting us so easily we'll talk about that and much much more headed left side sta wealth dot com register for this week's newsletter we speak to the top of the many more\nHad the website sta wealth dot com I'm pretty good to [noise]\nBe a money order on Cape your seat nine fifty fears look better\nAnd Mike Smith [noise] markets are largely down today ... but the ... the tech heavy NASDAQ stock indexes overall\nFor under some selling fresh or just say that's the big loser right now they're going to ... percent on the\nOne as the NASDAQ one hundred a is following the lowest level more than two months and so uh it's again it's most risk dropping hours coming into some heavier trading and that can be seen by the\n... you know some of the trading activity the we're we're tracking as well so the recent loss of the tech leadership\nUh can also be seen when we were talking about it and our technical commentary sections last week\nThe cyclical versus some of the more defensive and staple names are are I mean that that we ... you know it's a good thing about being writing these things and the newsletters and we do obviously have planning topics and estate planning topics and tax topics\nBut we always sort of have our investment and you know markets sectors and technical commentary just to keep people from sometimes is you know if you really want to get engaged in it because you see some market volatility people start clicking on at reading it and registering for it and all that we have over thirty twenty thousand subscribers right here\nI'm In Houston area and now we have them many parts of the world actually now but um you know and ... you've got people that are watching these kinds of things and this is where again I think you can go back to the advantage as you can go\nBack in those was this rationale sound\nDidn't make sense and how was it played out in so many people say well I was right on this well were you and do you have anything to document that what what was it well we have a newsletter\nAnd so we ride up our opinions on these things and we try not to ... ... you know we don't want to be in position speculating but we want to lay out our discipline sort of looking at these issues right of the broader markets or um you know where the domestic international or even emerging markets looking into print sectors and industries and even companies at times\nTo sort of get the neighborhood and try to understand what's happening and tried to give people more strategic\nLonger term trend guidance and you've seen it and you've seen is sick of goals and we said about where we are\nJust mean think of it where we are in the business cycle is that speculation are we as it is by going out on a limb to say that we're probably not in the early stages of the business cycle\nI was the moment just sort of work explain this to them a ... it's it doesn't really so you don't you don't have to be a technician or a you know a finance expert I think may ... people understand that it's it's reasonable or if you're just applying some common sense you know if you get a basic understanding\nProducer price index came out today a point two percent per September which is kind of leveled out which means that wholesale prices inflation is there but kind of eased off a little yeah yeah well\nPeople have been talking about inflation right and of course you know they were saying well is is the reason or the um you know it's going to be the biggest risk to the ... the global economy US Economy now\nNow it's not it's emerging markets what's going on there and why the way they have an enormous amount of debt themselves and they don't have the economy the size and scope the strength in order to deal with the debt that they have so these are issues and look these high ... check\nTech stocks they've been changing it's been changing for a couple of weeks we've been talking about it in fact this week's newsletter what goes up must come down if that's not a timely title ...

Carter Blackburn right in our office he's a young guy of kind of a newly wed got to have you on the way\nI loaned him a copy of my DVD I'm ... Mann which is an Nineteen thirty for comedy was William Powell and Myrna Loy I'm looking for her but never he hasn't watched it yet you know why you have a DVD player player yeah so it's dream as I'm gonna I'm gonna watch it I probably watch it but he doesn't even have one it's\nJust it's changing a Netflix has a good example so they say you know they used to ship the DVDs and people say well you know that blacks just uh it just\nWell then they change a Netflix changing in the industry changing and the companies are changing some of 'em are trying to change it of all I think Wal Mart has tried to do that although it's struggling to keep up with like some companies like Amazon Best Buy is trying to do that even while they have the brick and mortar stores are also trying to have a big on line and best online presence\nAs well as making their store experience better\nUh and for people to want yeah you want to come in there and you know kick the tires so to speak to our eye pad or a or a laptop to see what's going on there and then go on line and compete for the best price and they'll give it to you right there in the store\nThat's that's a much better business ball but it's going to continue to change and the companies that don't are going to be the ones that are um you know are going to be left the white side so you see the changing of the volume and\nGo into three D printing thinking about uh the evolution of artificial intelligence a biotechnology a it's a pretty amazing uh but I think from an investment standpoint I think a lot of people think I'll just by General Electric and collected evidence why would I ever change all does by IBM\nAnd IBM is international but what I Would I sell IBM why would I sell General Electric is a global industrial conglomerate pays ... it'll never stop paying a dividend\nWell\nWe've not seen examples now I'm sure people said that about a JC penny and Sears and and maybe some other stores Sears or I mean who would sell Sears, Roebuck\n... my point is that these things are changing as investors even within the market even within sectors I think you have to be informed about new business models and how they're changing the consumer behavior and now as an investor you can take advantage of these things that doesn't mean you're going to hit home runs and become\nSome sort of a savvy you know I don't know major trend following investor you don't want that you want long term wealth building an accumulation but you also want to understand where the opportunities are and where the risks are\nBecause we do our same investor saying why would I ever sell General Electric when it gets cracked fifty percent how much dividends for how long would you have to get paid that dividend to break even\nSo it it you have to go up a hundred percent to make back a fifty percent decline\nAnd that is a pretty monumental task and it's all day long time for a company like a General Electric to ever get back there if it ever does\nA and then so be it will say well look why don't we just by and holding and well okay that's now do you always want to buy the broad market hope it all works out in the end well you've got the the the Japanese which were not too long ago the second largest economy in the world\nOr the Nikkei average obviously still hasn't gone back to where it was Nineteen eighty nine you'll have to live a long time in retirement to buy on hold collect dividends and hope it all works out in the end while but you know getting your purchasing power", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "10"}
