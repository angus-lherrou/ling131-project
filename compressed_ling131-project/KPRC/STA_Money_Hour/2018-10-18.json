I'm by some you were tough to watch that last night actually\nI did not like that I have reviewed that call probably two dozen times on my DVR what is your conclusion my conclusion is that he closes on glove\nTwo dozen times sounds like you put some thought and I do\nBecause it was because I Want to be fair yeah I Want to be fair and have some time I have some time and I kept going back and forth and I said he closes on glove was not found her parents they were on the other side of the wall and I'm here at the mall was outside of his Mitt anyway [laughter] you know outside\nOf his Mitt anyway yeah uh so what you're saying is bad call it rests on the umpire\nI Believe it rests on not not just the individual but I'm the Lincoln the replay that took place was ridiculous I thought for sure they were going to ... see the way I was seeing but it's funny how polar people are on this a\nLot you know this is one ... polar up the poor people are on it but then people start talking about the conspiracy theories a little bit which you know hey you got a big market in Boston you talk about the New England fans are all the time yeah I'm from time to time\nAnd it's like well not all of ... do they want to see a culture Austin\nYou know they want to see the Boston team go in dollars are at stake you know I used to ... to go yeah but really Boston is probably the bigger the year Yankees you know there's a big big market club he's in a big market club to have it\nSo it is you subscribe to any of the uh\nI don't know that kind of a you know we look at that way because we wanted I got to steer it that way have the basketball and I don't\nYeah I mean [noise] I don't think Houston gets the respect that we deserve that across the board that's a fact times in the past it's been probably deserved you know we're a very large diverse city with wonderful people and\n[noise] you know the NFL that's another one\nYeah when they do have time highlights on Sunday they show clips of Tom Brady and whoever else negate the Texans they only show highlights latest sale of Texans are planted jaguars and they don't you know why is it less that no love and you know we're the energy capital of the world yeah great things going on here I just think that we could Sims but I'm just saying\nI think you're right I think it's a valid point you're making a you know I don't just say that because I live here I think it's a objectively you can look at it and say you know even the times that they play I mean unless they're sort of in the playoffs they don't get any primetime love\nThe noon game but you know I have to earn your way they're a little bit yeah star what some games going to the playoffs what is the playoff games maybe uh maybe the next season you get three o'clock game yeah\nWell the Astros were outstanding this year and they were very great and they don't go away you know you know is what it is but ah probably\nGoing all the way is very low very low man stood when very very low they have a great team and I'll tell you what they're fun to watch they're fun to watch so that entertainment factor they're fun to watch and people are behind them and number two they're they're I think largely great\nClub is a great club of guys kind of folks you want to root for you know and I'll say the other thing is that uh they didn't give up\nYou know they didn't give up and let the wheels come offering an addict ... fight to the game and uh you know another thing all much into another positive note uh so it's kinda gloomy when you wake up the next day or after last like that for many years donations but I you know what they're pretty young team\nThe around doing it for a while yeah Oh absolutely Boston has a better team this year not that urging the Houston I'm just saying better team than last year\nYeah and the girls and they also do they even hobbling around that bomb leg is still much better than most of the player\nSo he's ... he's he's an amazing guy franchise player for sure\nYeah Muslim says let's shift to um the markets um we've had a another downturn today you know and this is part of it as part of the overall correction right I mean ... they're\nYeah well we wrote about it uh you know look we wrote about it last week a and also again this week an abrupt markets solve the title should investors care I think it was a a kind of walking people through this a little bit but on the technical commentary we talk again about what's going on with the um\nWith the ... was the technology sector would talk about the uh the uh the excuse me the small caps and what's going on there are so I think it's been um I think it's important to recognize some of these leading indicators and we also talked about was uh the\nTwenty day moving average exponential moving as moving they lowered the fifty that's one of the shorter term moving average signals that we look for course it can be bullish of the ... day is moving above the fifty but this case is moving below the fifth day moving average so that the barest cross so we're talking about that yes yesterday as a sort of\nA cross the getting a really last week but we wanted to confirm on that so we we we talked about yesterday in fact we reduce exposure so preserves them full disclosure the domestic equities but you know it's um\n[noise] uh we'll see if that proved to be correct it did prove to be correct on international markets particularly the emerging markets\nBecause uh you know the Shanghai index which largely makes up emerging markets a bear market territory in fact for year lows\nOr we'll talk about that and do they show 'em and you see the emerging markets for the year down about Fifteen Percent or but as you said earlier the Dow Jones industrial average down triple digit declines and caterpillar apple sci fi doubt about one and a half almost two percent communications technology sectors lag\nYou remember what we said oh this is one day but we've seen a bit of a trend here over the last say week or so of trading certainly so who's seen the recent downturn the big question as has ... has the is the United states us markets and economy old we got it to remain deep coupled\nFrom the rest of the world and their markets and I think it's gonna be very challenging for them to do that that seems to be now there are a couple of ... so to speak with what's going on in the rest of the world and we also talked about where we are in the business cycle trying to understand that in fact we've got to put the baseball analogy to it or in the seventh inning\nOr are we in the first ending or wait a second ... are we any closer to maybe the sixth or seventh inning and if you're in that stage of the business cycle I think what you have to consider as what sectors what areas perform better at those stages of the economic business cycle so in this case we're in\nThe later stages and you can imagine that you just said discretion discretionary stalks of bringing out of favor technology stocks have been out of favor and many of these others but what has been in favor including\nThe day has been more defensive ... even the real estate in\nFavor of us all these all have been doing better and we've tried to get people to recognize that but we'll discuss it again embarrassed cross yesterday from a technical perspective in this was his letter more my home on the website SCA ... already\nComes each week so uh I think it's pretty ... it out of the money on\n\nThe [noise] you know back to the FDA money our on TV or see nine fifty years or so and Mike Smith\nA mess if you're sort of in the outfield methods issue and you see the ball coming probably an arm's length ... are you going to reach\nOut maybe not over the wall but are you going to reach out and try to\nAbsolutely yeah I think is normal yeah I think is normal I think people kind of a hammer and all these guys about that but the truth of it is it would have been better if they had not because of all clearly what just got over the fence and that guy was in the midst of all yeah yeah\nWell it is a I Believe that portion of the walls only seven feet yeah that's another one of those little quirky nuances about two minute may\n[noise] um you know like it or not but I don't know man HD review DVR\nWhy do you I mean then they say they can't get the ankle and somebody was in the way and all and like I Do not have twenty five go pros right down the foul absolutely why do not have that kind of money coming through there why is it that we've got some some person sort of leaning and the way you can't really see I mean come on\nReally yeah I don't like orange sour grapes or I'm Sorry go pros it was terrible bad deal ideal ideal Coley ... ... I mean of course they fought hard to write in it and was to rise to run yeah\nAnd another ... coming up yeah [noise] it's kind of irritated or try not to sound [laughter]\nIt's a distraction from what's happening in the market today I Believe\nIt is a little bit that's true that's true well it's you know you feel kind of feel a little there's a bill right when you wake up after a loss like that no annoying it's kind of a sick feeling in your in your stomach kind of a [noise] I don't allow myself\nTo get over invested emotionally in any of these things went to lose but you know you just want to root for me one of the you don't want to do well when they don't just\nYou know I mean in other words if they win I don't act like we want my life has changed and better for it\nAnd if we lose you know I don't get depressed but it's kinda bummed out it's kinda bummed out hoping they'll do better I was in a I think that's the the sort of a reasonable uh area of\nHow you should be connected to these sports teams right Saudi lucky kinda bummed out sometimes you a little emotionally invested but you don't allow yourself to get like your life doesn't change\nYou know it's a nice diversion as as work should be hit I was an original or this morning and I saw 'em in the grocery store racks and racks and racks of all different kinds of astro shirts\nUnderweight emerging markets so we're not so then it is documented on paper in on the puck is [noise] um\nThe lowest it's been four years and by the way at least over the last I'll say few months because people say well armed valuations more compelling now the emerging markets\nYes they are but they say should now we buy I think at the same breath we always say it's going to create an opportunity\nBut not yet not yet not yet Shanghai down about three percent lowest level since November of two thousand and fourteen that's four years [noise] the market speaking loud and clear on China the country is losing\nNeeds to cry uncle\nIt's likely going to devalue its currency yet recently the United states has failed to our say um chose not to\nName China as a currency manipulator Chinese stocks are now to four year low as you see rising us interest rates the likelihood of less favorable trade deals is going to adversely impacts Chinese companies and profits and the next year it's market prices resetting lower to reflect all this\nWe've also talked about these trade deals and the market's telling us who they think well when does it look like China so this drop a Chinese stocks increases fears of the Chinese economy where\nThe largest of the world's second largest in the world can be slowing down dragging down global growth and these worries increased on Thursday also as we see the European Central bank ... president Mario Draghi said one of the risk for the economy was country trying to circumvent European Union budget rules\nAnd then budget that drug is comment sort of tell you a ... for the day and said major European stock market index to their session loves\nUs equity markets are already under pressure today and then we see the treasury yields turned back around a multi year highs housing is falling and we see the shares us construction E.

we saw was the sixteenth there was Tuesday\nA we had a nice round or the equity markets a big rebounds five hundred points to the Dow Jones industrial average so it's not all bad it's been pretty good but the volatility is here for sure and we've been recently talking about some of the headwinds in fact the NASDAQ which last month was closing in on the twenty handle\nA for the year as now ... trying to hang on to some double digits after going up a third of his games and we were six trading days the S. and P. five hundred lost half its gain for the year over the same time frame and is now up less than a five percent basically for maybe now even less than four percent of the clothes the market closed the day where it is at this point\nThe spread between growth in value as strong as well but the value out forming slightly during the correction or something we also talked to and so corruption is actually\nStretching by the way the traditional definition as I'm Talking about here the S P is down about six percent in October which is well short of the generally accepted definition of corruption of being down ten percent\nThe NASDAQ one hundred and the Russell two thousand\nDown in excess of ten percent on their lows last week so\nI guess that qualifies for those and official corruption territory the downdraft this month is really just been the normal marker action or just seems extreme because of what we see so we're a little while to leave which is now considered more normal in recent years and that seems shocking\nWhen it returns and we've also written about much of this in fact this week you can\nRead about uh the ... will read the newsletter and read about some of our commentary on this topic again this title is a a abrupt sell off should investors care\nSo we discuss whether or not we think investors should be caring about this reasons so often we talk about the technicals and recently we talk about the barest cross we see on the U.S will be five hundred [noise]\nAnd again we talked about being a significantly uh ... well waited an overweight in fact for all of two thousand Seventeen\nIf you follow the same signal you'll see what we were there and then you'll see in February will begin to get out of the emerging markets and I'm Talking about the emerging markets space so we've been committed the are still constructive to the U.S and the five hundred US equities but look consider emerging markets are down global equity markets broadly ex United States are down\nFor the year I mean you see bonds are down for the year um and\nSo they'll look for for for ... has been challenging the one area a bright spot globally really has been the S. and P. five hundred\nHas the coupled and had been to a couple of now for from the rest of the global markets in sort of the continuation of that you know is that going to continue is the big question and were recently we've been talking about some of the headwinds I think that there'll be not so much of a maybe see downdraft what we see in the emerging markets base\nBut probably not going to be remaining ... coupled\nA forever [noise] uh\nIt but by the way we see this bull market now about ten years old and you might be surprised how many stocks are trading below their all time highs we're not that far even with this recent market correction\nFrom our all time highs but taking a closer look I think I just want to give some people some thought about looking at the numbers some interesting numbers about the U.S and the five hundred\nEven again is we're not that far from a recent highs and
