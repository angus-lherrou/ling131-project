October fest seasons nearly over my favorite type of beer October fest\nOh yeah they they ... they're running out of same out of every one guy I like one but I joined October I get excited 'cause that's when I'll drink beer and particular October fest that's a bucket list thing for me it was good in Munich and uh [noise] that would be fine that do the festival I'd like to do that one time being addressed in the office you mean the with the\nPush up the the ... or the oh you mean you ... you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not\nOut of the man outfit [laughter]\nSeemed to pull back a little bit but I mean people need to always rethink different parts of their portfolio and in particular cash is not yielded in such a long period of time to finally that sector a gay some light here and you know it might be someplace that challenges equities for a while people now look and see what I can earn a an interest rate that's relatively risk free\nVersus taking a risk um but I don't know I I'm looking across some of the carnage at this market is taken I mean there are some selective opportunities and which\nHas been carnage I mean yeah there's been there's been some sectors uh some stock that have been beaten up pretty bad below their fifty two week highs a pretty significant but you know it's nice to start putting at least the list and uh and and and together and looking at where you might want to shop down the road but when things are on so you don't go running out of the store\nWhile used but but I think it was talked about the breath to the market and then what you have to decide and one thing or those six names that made the markets returns especially after this latest round of the six names the ... and technology the sector that contribute ... percent of returns for the U.S will be a hundred and first off year\nIs that going to be sustainable or as the rest of the world including the rest of the stocks within the U.S and the five hundred\nGoing to have the last say and that would basically indication a negative\nNegative territory see all the classes around the world negative and you have every year nearly every other stock except for about six names that were driving the returns and that your territory certain right now we have what two hundred of the five hundred names and the U.S will be five hundred down twenty percent or more\nSo um I think that has been something that is just sort of stood out to our best team as something that was an unsustainable scenario so again I think has been a big part of what we're seeing being played out here the recent weeks and again we keep talking about these ask classes and just want to re emphasize\nYou know you have some cash on the sidelines or you did you develop some cash on the sidelines of maybe redeployment back in February out emerging markets international and they were recently we saw the U.S markets get sort of a correct to phase\nAnd that very market ... across the short term you've got some cash on the sidelines\nOf going to create a lot of great opportunity that's what side of that it's not just fight as far as the Internet has gotten out of somebody's sauces nationally this year got somehow these us act leisurely or as well so while you're going to have some great opportunities that [noise]\nBut do through to do that would have been at the website SEA wealth dot com

two\nPositive a little bit today about one half of one is broadly on the U.S and the and the Dow Jones industrial average is interesting\nUh as we've been writing and talking about the declines and things that we consider even so the leading economic indicators but really more on the markets side of things are colluding valuations and Federal Reserve policy liquidity issues a margin debts long term that we we we went through our last presentation we did so with the client dinner\nWe talked about global debt us debt margin debt corporate debt\nDeficits these are longer term macroeconomic issues that we have to be dealt with\nAnd then we talked about of course but it was her policy in central banks and what they were doing a house or that was providing with the market and we saw these amazing I thought correlations particularly with margin debt and the problem is with us equity prices and we said look these are this is the analysis that we need to take place frankly every week\nAnd then as we began to sort of prepare our portfolios for that\nWe're telling again of some of our our our our clients those at dinner just last week and so we saw this pretty rare event recently this you know the sell off of a temper ... say give or take\nThe equity markets um basically the second\nSuch corruption within eight months is rarely happens by the way in one calendar year much less with 'em an eight month period you see a pretty this will be again a pretty rare event\nUm and\nYou know you you see Monday's wild swings right even yesterday ... drive the Dow Jones industrial average to\nBeing eight point nine percent decline\nFrom its early October all time closing high we saw the U.S will be five hundred close up a little bit yesterday it's down as of yesterday's closed nine
