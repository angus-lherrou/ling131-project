grew up in the small town with Mike and\nWorked my way up through everything my parents always taught me the value of hard work and that nothing in life is fair and if you wanted something you're gonna have to work for it so I did I went to ... started working in the construction and out in the the refineries area of the Houston area\nAnd then after that I paid for my own college didn't work fulltime and did that and went to night school kind of worked my way through that but I realized that during that period of college\nI was working fulltime and going to school at night so I used to these really long full days and then when I finally graduated\nI had plenty of time so it was almost like the engineering job that I was like a part time jobs forty hour week job seemed like part time to me so I said well can I Do to fill these extra time this extra hours that I got and what better way to do to learn new skills and starting new businesses where\nHe's out obviously know the value of hard work I think a lot of kids today people today they they lack that so I think this book really kind of instills that vision especially what you had what just tell us a little bit what inspired you to write this\nBook while I've done pretty well with these businesses as you read in the book and I have a lot of people especially colleagues and close friends are always asking me how I did things and I've always been the the ... type type of person to share this kind of information and never keep things secret always want to help other people and I decided you know a couple of years ago I had this book in my head\nAnd that I just needed to get it out on paper and get it out there for the world for people to understand how to do things and really that that was the main thing is to help us many people as possible\nFor people ... and I won't spoil the book promise\nBut people have always come to you and kind of ask your advice on different things right and I think you've got to finally one day just said hey you know what a let me put this down on paper and kind of lead to hear your uh you know Amazon's best seller so you know congratulations again um but you know we talk about uh the average person out there and I think what is appealing about this book\nYou know here to stay well we talked a baby boomers we talked to people about retirement\nAnd you know there's probably not one person that uh we talk to you that would not like to make extra money and it's not this book about where you know or somebody like Jeff Bezos and\nHow he came became a a a billionaire but this was a I think a realistic a vision and realistic how to for just anybody out there that might want to make some extra money but just kind of it and and your ... who is this book for I mean and and who did you a target right in this\nBefore so my ideal customer or client is the self driven person who's maybe work their way had some investments in corporate career maybe you've already ... have your degree or certifications and you have this full time job you may even love your job you may hate your job\nBut I don't ever want to be the end we could have anybody who's just going to tell him to quit their job just just push a reset button and and do everything will be an entrepreneur I think that's\nA fallacy that you hear a lot now days on special and success type podcasts and books they tell you to follow your passions but to me that's just not responsible so what I'm really looking for these people who have fulltime jobs you may have hit the glass ceiling in their career\nOr maybe they've not had that outlet of creativity or learning leadership or management skills within their career so they want to do something to become that\nWell the word entrepreneur I mean I think you know a lot of people extrapolate what that meaning is one of the points you make in the book is you say that it's hard\nAnd that is something that you know I I think a lot of books try to make it sound like it's easy anybody can do it but you do mention is hard and you point out one of the things you point out many entrepreneurs if he actually talked to somebody who successful I promise as if they really are truthful\nThey're going to tell you that had many failures but what is your thoughts in terms of what does it mean and tell us why is it hard to be an entrepreneur\nWell a lot of people think if you're a business owner that you get to pick and choose your hours but that's not always the case we we kind of joke about that which which twenty hours of the day do you want to work that's the that's the picking the hours a lot of times when you're doing a start up\nAnd the the business models that I tried to go into his more digital base where it's not going to take a lot of hands on a lot of time requirements but they will take a lot of investment time up front to get things going efficiently when it's all paying your dues\nAnd I think that that's just the way it is it's it's hard work any way you want it there's no there's nothing in life that you ... you know nothing that worth having his coming comes easy you know so you always have to put it in the work to do these things and into I don't believe in get rich quick\nTo get rich quick is measured in years not months\n... get rich quick is probably lead to get a quick as well I mean we've we've seen we all know stories we hear about it as a matter of fact you know just back to business I mean many people fail me twenty percent of new businesses fell in the first year I mean that's that's just as as a ... we always seen we hear about\nBut it is not easy and one of the things uh you know I Want to kind of even talk about is you know the term side hustler I mean that's\nThat's what a you know you're talking about in terms of the book I mean what exactly does that mean it's not just to figure out how to make a million dollars okay but even save somebody wants to just make an extra amount of money but what does that term mean for you and how'd you come up with that\nSo you probably heard the the phrases severe anybody's on social media they hear the or they see the phrase used hustle ought will side hustle it's just a play on that it's a side business so it's a business that you can operate while you have a fulltime career and so it's actually a really large community now days on line to side hustle community\nSo that's kind of where it stands for and I really wanted to go after the nitty gritty people that you know have those jobs but they want to have that extra income and they do that by creating a business on the side well\nNo I think you know it it it does have a different meaning for many people but I mean bottom line is a is not quitting your job and I and I really liked that because\nYou know one of the books and you and I talked off the air we talked at lunch and I think one of our favorite books just setting the foundation for this it's called ... I mean that is you know multiple income streams and yes it would be nice to start a side business and it does so well\nThat you can quit your normal job that that is not the idea that you're pointing out in your book and so one of the concepts I think that is critical and it goes back to being an entrepreneur in many people have the fallacy of thinking by my own boss I'm going to have my own hours and they have all this free time\nAnd you and I both know that's not the case okay but a lot of people don't know that but I think the critical part of understanding is creating and having the mindset in the mindset is so important so when we\nCome back I Want you to elaborate on what does it take to have the mindset to sort of side hustle business you buy the website SEA wealth dot com you listen to the SBA money on [noise]\n\nThe USDA money our radio that it's right on the\nMoney to buy the website SCA will dot com excuse on for the weekly newsletter here with our special guest Toni ... he's the author of side hustle millionaire\nToni welcome back then having some good conversation if you're just joining us or you could find a book on Amazon is a best seller in nine hours surpassing Trump's order the deal again congratulations that's a a a fantastic accomplishment\nBut we're just a kind of wrapping up we're talking about it's not easy to be an entrepreneur I think there's a huge fallacy thinks there's this big freedom and starting a business now don't get me wrong there can be\nBut do not go in there with that thought process as a matter of fact this kind of got me into the next topic is a whole chapter in your book chapter to it's called the mindset and so I thought for a minute elaborate your audience our listeners on the mindset of what you need and it's the mindset that you have so maybe tell us a little\nBit about that I think that the the business owners that I helped start their first companies a lot of times they have a unique skill or talent in a technical type capacity but they don't have the business background of the business ... jump in thinking that\nI'm a good you know a mechanic or doing something like this I Need my own shop but they don't they kind of miss out on the the towns that's really needed his business management\nAnd so I really going to go into the for defying things but really before we even get to that point it's the people that are just they have ... different excuses about things about not starting and I really wanted to spend at least a chapter chapter and a half to try to get past all these things they tried to show people that\nThe people who have reached success are no different than they are and they've had the same excuses and that's what I'm trying to help with on these\nYou know it wasn't a probably about a few months ago all sitting around for people and they're all talking about starting a business okay\nI'm In two of them left the room and I looked at the other two and I said those those two do not have the mindset and they looked at me and said\nWhy do you say that well for what reason I said they have done nothing but sit here and talk about excuses since we've had this conversation I said you to have talked about your vision and what you're going to do\nAnd you know one after doing this for many years of yourself you can identify that but you know what it's funny you talked about excuses as a matter of fact let's talk about some of those and I'd love to just kind of get your response because I'm sure you've heard many of these and I'd love to hear what you would say back so\nNumber one is a I think if you are if you really pro did anybody people were just going to say this is the number one is I just don't have enough time Tony I Know you talked about this in your book I just don't have the time to do this now what is your response for that so this one's going to be\nPainful for all your listeners if you if you use that excuse and I think most people have\nThe reality is it's not your priority and the the fact is that we always make time for our priorities so whatever you guys are doing right now\nWhether that's spending too much time watching TV or socializing surfing Facebook doing hobbies all these different things it could even just be your family things that are your priority and that's fine but just realized that whatever you're doing to consume your time all day long is your priority and when you start to reframe that and ask people\nTo really not have time or is it really not your priority and if you feel pain from that statement you need to pay attention to that pain because that's telling you something you've got to do something to change to get rid of that pain you\nKnow it's just like when it comes down to a budget I don't have enough money okay right right everything down somebody like me or somebody like you can come and go you can cut this cut the same thing\nThe businesses would know goal in mind and to me that's just like wandering around the forest\nWithout a map you know I'm sure you've had this tiny and you know being a wealth management firm you know clients come and say I want to start a business or friends you know one of the first things I Will tell them is okay great show me your business plan and I mean I'm sure you probably is the asked that question what happens\nThey there was that there is NO PLAN right yeah well I said well how did this come about while sitting with my friend and we were talking about starting a business I said okay\nWe have we gotten any further from there I mean they've already talked about you know the structure and everything else as far as what they're going to be doing in\nUh having talked about how they're going to get there and you see that there's a lot of mistakes they get there and I think one of the great things about your book she kind of followed this thing through and we're going to get more into this because one of the things I Do want to talk about a ... on the next segment is some of the biggest challenges I mean\nYou know we can't go into this and we're talking about the mindset but they're also our challenges is not a scare you type book it's just here's all the things and how you overcome them it's here's what's ... here's what you're going to encounter\nHere solutions over over overcome those and then move through but anyways I says I just thought it was funny at all the time you hear people talking about starting a business but yet there's no business plan or idea of how they're going to do that yeah\nIdeas or the easy part so don't pat yourself on the back for having ideas just realized thousands of people die every single day with great ideas but they didn't execute on 'em so ideas are lazy part Mikey can we can sit here and brainstorm a hundred ideas for businesses but we're not going to do anything it\nDoesn't matter if I was talking about some of the biggest challenges to an easy for people starting businesses and maintaining the business you're by the website sta wealth dot com and you're listening to the SEA money are\nFifty years or so\nWalking back and by the website SCA wealth dot com or special guests Tony ... author side hustle millionaire\nAs a matter of fact you can go to Amazon and get on a hard copy paper bag\nAnd you can get on Kendall right correct and you are the best seller and that you did this and nine hours I'm a heck of a can accomplishments such a great books a hundred pages you know I think it would take anyone two days to read this and you know we've been kind of talking about\nYour background we talk about the mindset of a a entrepreneur I mean how do we get into that we've talked about some of the excuses people have to not do this and then of course some of the reasons why somebody would want to do this but now\nI think we're we're kind of getting his some of the challenges I mean this is where you know you kind of cover everything in in such a a fast pace I mean hundred pages and you seem to cover every angle of this congratulations that's not easy to do I mean there's a book on IRAs at seven hundred pages that I Will never read\nA because it's it has to be born this is a good book it's interesting\nBut when you get the challenges I mean some of the biggest challenges I'm you know I'll just kinda threw out the first one it's it's it's like the life blood of a business and that cash flow and uh you know you've had examples of this just the other day you know business owners she's been a her business seven years\nAnd she has not made herself salary why throw money back in the business but what can you speak to somebody that you know look and start a business what can you talk to them about casual with some advice about managing cash flow I think a lot of\nTimes the small business owners they they pay themselves too much initially\nAnd so anything extra beyond their bills they pay for themselves and they put it in their own bank account here's the problem that I understand the cash flow you got to have a certain pile of money to operate the business where you got to be able to cover your expenses\nAnd then have some period of time 'cause sometimes these these manufacturers and everything are net thirty net sixty and they won their payments later on so you gotta be able to float that money through there without having to\nCreate more sales in order to pay these these bills you never want to get in that situation a run into it a lot of times in the automotive sector especially they're they're basically taking on more work to pay for the ones that they've already landed the contracts\nAnd they're just kind of just got this robbing Peter to pay Paul syndrome and that happens a lot in the small business because they just don't understand you got to have a surplus of cash all the time\nWhen I absolutely and I think you you you will see statistically that is one of the biggest a death sentence has a small business will ... some of the other challenges what if some of the other challenges that you would uh it you know discuss with somebody about starting a business\nI think a lot of times you may be a really good at a let's say supporting technical role in any kind of thing you may be an engineer or a mathematician or a mechanic or to these technical type things but if you don't invest in yourself and become a better sales person or better marketing expert\nThose are going to really think he was well because you could have the best product in the world but if you don't know how to market it and people don't know how to find you\nThen you're not going to sell any so at the end of the day that each businesses existing to create a transaction and if you don't know how to close that dealer find customers or target down or maybe even not even most people don't even niche down far enough to go to their target customers they go in really too broad\nAnd they don't pick up any traction is easier to start small with the really precise niche and they grow as your company grow so there's a lot of challenges but I think marketing and salesmanship\nAre very important and if you can't do it hire somebody else that can do it for you\nYeah so basically bottom line is do something to do it well and then expand from there and I think you've seen a Amazon I mean they were in their ... now but you saw them do something very well and now they're grabbing just about everything else that's out there\nProbably a pretty big example but my bottom line is I think if people get the point what about the other thing people in general I mean you know started a business the challenge could be who you have in business with you I mean how many are examples do I know partnerships and\nYou know just individuals personalities but I mean what would you say in regards to somebody you know challenges in in terms of people or would you kind of give the advice in terms of how to manage that\nI think a lot of times people will start the small businesses with a comfort level at one of their friends or family members of being a partner with them and I'm strongly against that I think you should try to start things on your own and the way I evaluate positions within a company as if I can hire that person for that skill set\nThat I should just hire somebody has an employee I don't necessarily need them as a partner unless they're bringing some huge value to the table that we can both capitalize from whether they have a big network or a financial investment there's got to be a really legit reasons to start with partners\nBut a lot of people just do it because they don't want to jump off the cliff by themselves so then you start to get into issues down the road about people not having their goals aligned so some people may want to tap out in two years\nWhen they're making a hundred thousand dollars a year but the other partner modern he might want to be making a million dollars a year and they're not going to see it as you say you're basically think about your your partner as you're getting married to them and they it is a marriage\nAnd it is a partnership and you both have equal decisions and do you really want to get up to that dinner table only get half your dinner every time you have some kind of success they always got to keep these things in mind higher if you can't hire look for a partner\nAnd I can add one thing too if you do end up having foreigners have a partnership agreement\nThat spells all these things out and yes of course you may be thinking we're never going to break up we're going to be fine make sure you define how that splits apart in there that way it's a very simple I'll tell ya oh that's that's good advice in general okay so we've been through this you know talking through the book so far the mindset that challenges\nYou know what about if somebody's just listen to this going OK I'm with you so far\nBut how on earth do I come up with the idea of a side hustle business where do I get that idea of what would you tell them\nThink the easiest way to do is they evaluate the skills or kind of resources that you currently have if you have some kind of a special knowledge or skill maybe like writing and you can do some ghost riding for novels or you can do copy writing or maybe you're just good at designing you could start doing some graphic design on the side so there's all these things that you should look at\nAnd one of the evaluation process as I go through there is to evaluate each of these ideas against each other so it always recommend is coming up with a long list of everything that you enjoy doing whether your hobbies and these things and try to figure out how to monetize these\nAnd then you can go through this simple addition process that I give you that it's almost like a a risk analysis that sees if it can get you to the financial goal that you're looking for so you start to weigh these against each other and you actually have actual values to compare", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "08"}
