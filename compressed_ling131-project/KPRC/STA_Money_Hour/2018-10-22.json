she's a very outspoken she's a good one yeah she is a good one she's great well happy anniversary to graduation that both of you who only three years that's ...\nUh well last week we saw the Dow Jones industrial ... almost a rose almost one half of one percent we saw small kept Russell two thousand index fell a little more than one half of one percent we see the advance decline lines continue to sag new lows or swamping the new eyes\nSo that's the advance decline line basically and it just telling us that we're seeing more ... and we're seeing in the new eyes\nThere are ... we're only seven new highs on friday we saw large captures the value stocks out perform growth stocks last week\nThe Russell one thousand value indexes wasn't about one is actually zero point three percent this year the growth version has done nine percent but last week again we're sending the shift in the value stocks\nAnd while we expect value investing will eventually turned to a longer term wrote a leadership role\nI think it's going to take some time before the momentum of these trends become more evident\nRight now it's earnings season and this week we are right in the middle of it I think what thirty percent of the five hundred companies will be reporting this week [noise]\nEighty four companies in the U.S will be five hundred reported\nEarnings thus far they have been pretty stellar sales up over seven percent earnings have exploded over Twenty one percent we've also seen earnings beat estimates by little over four percent so this level of increase in terms of earnings year over year is not sustainable we would expect earnings growth to fall back to more normal levels\nAnd there's lots of things to break down and hear one of them as being the um you know look the earnings good year over year we know a lot of this was a tribute to one is going to be a big break when the taxes for corporations\nAnd so you know how sustainable is are we expecting that for two thousand Nineteen I think that's what people are beginning to look at the market as forward looking we're even seeing guidance coming down\nA so are we going to get that kind of numbers now they're being reported we're seeing a little bit of a good or bad sort of selling into the news we can't really get ... rally I think a before today ten of the past twelve sessions\nAnd the S. and P. five hundred or negative I think nine of the last uh say ten or so for the NASDAQ negative negative so far to down slightly down the NASDAQ is up today the tech heavy NASDAQ\nUh last week I think also recently generally we've seen more defensive stocks\nPlay out better have not have we been talking about this right absolutely we're talking about the cells rotation themes I mean these are things that you know we we look at all the time and the people that have been buying holding passive you've enjoyed a long period of time frame but you need to be starting to adjust what you're doing but you know you're talking about looking forward thinking it and a two thousand Nineteen\nI mean the higher costs a dead I mean this is what businesses are looking at is I started doing projections\nAnd their budget for two thousand Nineteen they know the cost of the debts going higher also keep in mind wages are increasing I think many firms are ... they're going to have to pay up in a way just to keep\nTalented employees at bay so that's a higher costs that squeezes margins and I think the other thing is economic growth is that going to start to slow down global cells or you know here domestic cells so is that going to pull back to what a lot of companies are going to be looking at for next year well a look at what China reported\nLast week and a half percent GDP Growth that is a slower for them or they have come out recently actually and said including a the the premier that they met the dictator lifetime\nPremier as you're paying recently said and basically took a a feather out of the the ... the ... the German or the European Union a central bank the European Central bank to simply\nRecording to do everything is necessary to support this economy so apparently a row and then be does grow on trees as does US dollars so they're going to print enough money to whatever\nIt takes to keep the economy afloat\nThe IMF by the way downgrade of us real GDP Growth for two thousand Nineteen to two and a half percent from two point seven\nUh and so that's just a I think also noteworthy but in terms of the United states and earnings this week being so big it's thirty percent of the U.S will be five hundred market cap reports this week Amazon alphabet intel horizon Microsoft\nBig names Twitter McDonald's a caterpillar UPS Deutsche Bank United Technologies Halliburton just to name a few of these companies are guidance is now the key\nFor how um investors we pricing and the appropriate multiple for next year and that's where I think is happening and that's those are beginning to look now into two thousand Nineteen revenues will also be gleaned very closely because so far reporting season we have seen thirty five percent of the eighty five companies missed their sales targets\nSeven point three percent year over year trend thus far as the slowest in four quarters\nWe see the earnings for sure maybe on track again for about twenty two percent growth but you don't have to be a genius to know that was the tax field share buybacks raises is over as we've been talking about the sky high margin that we've been good they're not going to last forever they're not necessarily sustainable so they're not going to be sustained\nAnd it will be a kind of the bottom lines that follow the top lines as opposed to the other way around and the equity and listen to people out there looking at the markets they're not necessarily being fooled a now forecasting or revenue growth to slow down for next year and a five point four percent again in two thousand nine from an estimated eight point two percent this year\nSo that scene is pretty good and look you see the stock market starts off pretty strong simply cannot hold the games you see that started strong this morning it was up ultimately has come back a little bit the S. and the five hundred is not managed to day advance says September twentieth\nAnd killer curiously enough the day\nIt hits record now down five point six percent since that record high not to mention take on a completely defensive posture so mentioned before we talked about these more defensive sectors the S. and P. five hundred was flat as a pancake at the end of the week last week on friday\nAnd would have been down more if it's more of these a recession proof slush defense of sectors like consumer staples up to point three percent like utilities up one point eight percent\nThose sectors lead the way on friday again the market being flat flat flat and the likes of Proctor and gamble up a point one percent Coca Cola up one point six percent when those socks are leading this is more the anti cyclical market for defense of sectors I think that's saying a little bit more than just a a flat day on the on the week\nYou know if you took out technology in terms of just take it out of the U.S and ... and then you looked at it I think you'd find out we've been a downer market for a lot longer period and that's what I think ms misleading a lot of people you know last week somebody hardest talking about you know having defensive strategies talking about hedging strategies and alternatives and you know what they called\nThey called and made an appointment and simply fact was we don't know how to do that and you know to come in to see somebody that does so if you don't know how to do that if you're not thinking about that you need to be or finding somebody to help you do that\nGoing forward yeah we'll we'll come back we'll talk more about burnings the big referring valuations so look for\nThe fences while they shave will take a look at that

favorite jeweler that makes the deals that can make deals because they've been in the same location since Nineteen sixty six moms\nThough to be sta money our on KNPR see nine fifty years or so\nArkansas off a little bit against the day they started off okay and then just a race\nWe withdraw those games that they had the NASDAQ is that the tech heavy NASDAQ is leading the way he is down about four points Dow is down just a few points\nAnd uh so as the Russell index so last week again we've talked about a rose about one half of one percent on the on the Dow Jones industrial average the Russell two thousand that's a small cap Russell two thousand index proximity fell one half of one percent we talked about this in the weekly newsletter\nThis is sort of the canary in the coal mine sometimes from the market standpoint as what's going on with a smaller stocks and they have been following they had been off of their highest for quite some time and of course you've seen these larger kept stocks do well for a\nWhile and now they begin to pull back a now almost six percent from the highs on the S P five hundred again earnings season pretty significant this week we see big earnings news or thirty percent of the U.S will be five hundred market cap I'll just repeat a few Amazon\nAlphabet into of arise in Microsoft or what your bank caterpillar McDonalds I live with ice cream\nIs

or McDonald's soft serve in the tip\nMy first job was McDonalds and the cleaning the shake machine was a nightmare\nYour show and in fact you know now we're seeing Italy debt to GDP ratio is over a hundred and twenty percent in to save Greece same thing actually more many of these outside of Germany they're all over a hundred percent GDP ratio does\nThat to GDP ratio is so you're seeing all of this debt and then they were trying to print all this money and in the ... tried to get the economy to rest on its fundamentals you're going to see some ... we have not seen all of all to me because of the comedy to position\nThat the the markets has always believed to be in other words they used to call it would've been vernacular the Germans or are they called the ... put\nRight that he has

some of the week or things that we see in determining whether or not this sustainable overseeing top line revenues which are a little harder to deal with from attack standpoint\nOr you want to see sales be significant and continuing their trend I think it can be difficult for them to do that next year expectations were revenue ... games will be something like five and a half percent\nA long way away from where we are this year at about nine percent so those things are going to be coming down and we'd expect I think many people are looking into next year for the guidance for next year's earnings\nAnd that they give you ... I Believe that ... extra journeys are not going to be as good that's one thing but how good are they going to be I think there's another factor in when you consider your taking out the benefits of this year over year improvements we saw from this a tax bit of a tax plan\nI think next year is going to be a little bit more challenging in fact I think you could argue I Believe you could argue that was declining revenues are games that their earnings will probably going to be even tougher to be current estimates\nSo that's going to be even more problematic for the market because again the most important thing for the market to move higher or determining whether to go lower are going to be earnings\nInterest rates\nThose are really things and I think the ah earnings are becoming down and rates are going to be higher during the next year in fact they're already priced and a little bit but we'll see what the Federal Reserve test\nWell over next year I think I think you're absolutely right it's going to be very challenging but in the near term and this is again why you have to have a good investment discipline and kind of breaking out what's longer term looks and and with a kind of short term but you know we are entering a favorable seasonal period I mean it's just\nKind of looking at the rest of the year if you go back and you study over the four year presidential cycle the current quarter and the next two have historically been the best so if you look at the average twelve month gain off mid term elections the but the basically the lows over thirty percent and since Nineteen forty six the essence he has never been down over the twelve months following in mid term election\nNow I don't know maybe this is the one that that ... bucks to trend\nBut in general the fourth quarter is probably one of the best quarters of the year for stocks\nAnd historically the best six month period for the stock starts in November first as something to keep in mind as we're hearing loss of negative headlines stuff this is typically the season was drawn period and just kind of looking at the data off Mitt terms I mean never having a down period over that a following six months I mean that's a pretty strong data so just\nYou know I think for anything as an investor don't become too pessimistic too fast this is why haven't indicators as we do you know looking at technicals looking at fundamentals and some of the macro data to make those decisions\nThat way you don't hit the object or button too fast because there's always a growing number of headlines every year back to the financial crisis you'll probably find several headlines that could have speech you out of the market but that discipline is going to be\nKey for a look I think emerging markets are going to get become a little more interesting a migraine they've had a very difficult year they've had a difficult a year and change in fact\nUh the Shanghai is down say thirty percent from his highs you know definitely bear market territory I think they're going to be a bit more interesting uh begin a lot of bad news is already pressed priced and we all sort of a bad review can believe it six and a half percent GDP Growth\nBut that's an emerging economy that has been growing much faster than that it's always seems to be slowing not for a recession standpoint it's still growing but it's not growing as fast\nAnd so that's also one of the things I wouldn't want to talk about planning the force segment but one of the things I Want to mountainous let our listeners know about\nIt seems to be a big win for the administration by the way but the Chancellor Merkel a German Chancellor is coming out now talking about\nA has she is now offered government support efforts to open up Germany to us gas\nOr the president's been taught you about this particularly around trade and the European Union he's talking about how you know the ... the European Union strictly Germany had ties with Russia and he's trying to get there to loosen the grip on Russia Russia loses grip on the European Union I should say the largest Europe's largest entity marketers Russia\nAnd over breakfast last month the chancellor told a group of small lawmakers or government had decided to co finance the construction of a five hundred million euro liquefied natural gas shipping terminal northern Germany uh and so Mr Trump is obviously intensely Bobby Europe to ... by significance", "show_name": "STA Money Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "22"}
