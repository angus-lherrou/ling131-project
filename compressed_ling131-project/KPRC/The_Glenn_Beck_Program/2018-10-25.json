Democrats so they might as well just have her come over here and just campaign personally for her ... Michel bring heard over these these ... are Democrats who want you to think they're all about the kindness in the fall\nFor here's an example Maxine Waters that's a hateful Democrat here's a bowl listen to this\nAnd that's\nYourself and your\nThat was a short while ago and here's a Maxine Waters this morning\nI think the president of the United states\nShould take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're saying oh for the first time in different ways I think the president that the United states if they don't listen to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there\nThey are by the way Trump I I I I'm kind of a news junkie follow I ... I never heard him say\nNever hurt him aside anyone to violence there even was if there was a clip of him doing that one time yeah is all you would see on the news all day\nWhere it'll have it where is it she calls for violence against the other side and then blame the other side for calling from uh as did that James Carville typical Democrat move as did\nA Hillary Clinton as did Cory Booker as did\nA whole bunch of them and if you throw the Hollywood Stars they'd actually talked about blowing up the White House and it's fascinating\nThe birth they sure have chili they didn't use the words kill the president yup nobody seems to worry\nAbout that now but he said well you know these Hollywood people in these reporters have got to quit ... up\nThe violence now Trump ... he's the he's the bad guy here I mean\nHopefully people are seeing through this they said that this uh this bomb thing that they've bomb scare they whipped up has the nation's scared to death I'm not scared that after you scared\nTo death nobody is excited by this except the people on television\nPeople on television or in a frenzy talking about the fear that has swept the land first of all those are fake bombs and there's no fear sweeping the land new none zero nada I Will tell\nYou there so the people in New York City Manhattan specifically and the others I guess a little too around editor Brooklyn area they do enjoy this kind of activity well forward to being told to shelter in place or to run\nFor your lives evacuating that makes them feel important they always feel like they're part of a TV show since most of the TV does it take place there\nSo when they put a call out that there's a bomb on a doorstep or something oh that is exciting news for those folks\nNot for the rest of us now like I say we can't do this all in one day\nThat's the reason we've scheduled at least one more day of this war tomorrow and hopefully we'll be able to chat about something besides what we worry any way the rest of the world will be able to chat about something besides the fake bombs I always only give us one day because we\nFigure yeah could be it I'm pretty sure we get tomorrow but after that you never know and this business so we only promise one day at a time so it will be here tomorrow for sure\nAnd we'll try to answer your questions we get email questions all the time a lot of it about that invasion force called the caravan where do they eat where do they sleep where do they store they're closing right they're bad roles anyone ever see um bed down for the night all seven thousand of 'em just suddenly go time to stop talking everybody\nMet down by the way they say now there's more like twelve thousand of them but some of them are dropping out a along the way 'cause they're just getting tired of all if they had no they said it'd be twenty thousand of adding a dropped out but we're ... we're up to about twelve thousand\nHow is it that people's supposedly fleeing intolerable conditions from their homeland wave flags from their homeland and seeing the national anthem of that intolerable land whenever a TV camera shows up\nWhere the lines at the port a potty mean you've been to Jazz Fest how hard it is a port a potty for about the same number of people were on the line I have\nNoticed since Monday when we brought up how clean they look and how they've all got Nike shoes and back ... they've started showing the dirty or more red tacky looking ones yeah they don't put those on any more\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's it's a\nIt's a lot of disingenuous stuff going on we will cover it we will cover things that nobody else will cover we will make predictions nobody else has predicted and we will define\nThe asked us has questions we've never seen\nThese are the skills that come when you were part of the wall then Johnson radio program I just can't wait now I Know it's going to sit here and stay on the radio and go combat combat you know that's how it actually pretty good to me even yeah I just pulled out of my ass moments ago [laughter] out\nThere that are going to say there's a bit of a rush to get out of here said don't boys and girls to it every day\nSeeing your seats please do we get fewer entertainment for a shocking announcement\nPortland is a workaround ... get rid of all the jobs\nThan troll their name is MS Thirteen they're one of the deadliest gangs in the world and that's Thirteen other violent gay spread their brand of terror frozen Erica including right here in Texas\nA man identified as Thirteen gang members are in jail accordingly\nShe said I don't want to you know add to anybody's pain do you think she did do you think Megan Kelly was sitting there going oh man\nThat's you know what you know it today show I'm going to bring up that lady Diana Ross and I'm just going to cause people paying she says\nThanks for listening and helping me listen to no\nNo I didn't hear it I don't know what was said to you all fair there is a lot of people in the audience that probably said yeah I mean they don't mean offense\nHow is this how is this a problem how is this a problem\nWell if we don't know we just know shut up apologies aren't good enough anymore they're not good enough doesn't matter\nWhere in the throes of cultural lawlessness executions on demand contacts commonsense doesn't matter execute them hang them getting rid of them\nYes what's happening next\nShe dropped by ca I think she was dropped by her talent age\nSee she is a pariah now she's a pariah and people will say on the right\nGood really good good people on the left will say good Megan Kelly affected anyone's life\nWell she has made it very difficult for\nNBC to live down their sexual harassment and assault that's been going around their offices she keeps bringing that up she was very serious and one of the biggest critics of NBC and the way they handled some of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way\nBut it seems to be to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that she said\nWhich is kind of fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know that they're going to tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really that Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy\nOr but we're going to find when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's when one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on and making Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critics of what happened and NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks there is no place on our air or in this work place\nFor those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I add that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who\nTake offense at the slightest thing and you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think that it's a vast\nBut I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this\n\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics and the last\nPlace probably the last comes first\nAcademia [laughter]\nYou should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not we're the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains\nIn in a um a in a ... a wagon train\nOkay is she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it okay she she'll she also\nKind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\n[laughter] you know she did she wiped her face and ... and kept going she didn't wine she cry about it she's like oh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that I poked my eye out and she moved beyond\n\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes things have\nChanged where involving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly ought to know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what\nIf it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black face has done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly\n... being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah\nQuestion it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people\nWhy is this wrong that\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume\nWhy is this wrong I think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't beat me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want another whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me\nHow are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river\nIf she floats we know she's a bigoted racist if she doesn't\nWell we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nBut it's just so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't thought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crimes stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter\nAnd here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind of world we want to end up in unfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is

there was a [noise] a very there's one individual uh in Honduras or who was\nThe victim of horrible a poverty and violence likely from a capitalist and decided just post on his Facebook page and\nThere was a grassroots effort to have a migrant march and these people who all of them are one of one hundred percent the the\nIt was Seventy five hundred people or fourteen thousand I was there

thousand in the entire world they're marching up there mhm I'm Out of the ... just to show\nA how how much they they love America and they just want to participate they want to change in in in freedom and I got an idea I think I could get fourteen thousand people\nTo march across the United states mhm okay march across the United states for you know any reason [laughter]\nNo I don't think I was fourteen thousand people in the United states capable of of this large yeah\nI don't think so okay you're talking about\nThe uh you know Seventy five or Seventy five hundred to fourteen thousand people marching what's left twenty six hundred miles\nMhm okay so that's not just something that everybody is like you know not do that\n\nNow what's really going on is this is all politically

are being used they're being used by political operatives in Honduras Mike Lee a senator who was always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you um [noise] uh you wrote to me last night and I'm not smart enough to understand it uh you said there is a there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that a Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state suggesting that they work out an agreement\nWith Mexico whereby a Mexico would require people to enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from\nAny of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from\nWith the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum in Mexico rather than in the United states would be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed by the\nEU for refugees are arriving in ... countries from Syria in other words when people were fleeing a a a a country that's dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such that they have an asylum claim\nThey ought to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially safe here that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I thought that when you wanted asylum\nI thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you were in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum I I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nYeah it should be more like that\nAnd that's not really how it works and that ... ... in order to these people end up applying for asylum with Mexico they're sort of going for the long bomb ill Mary pass and tried to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous journeys itself\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited a ... it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually\nAssaulted during the ... and a lot of the people claiming asylum\nTurn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once\nThey're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back and we think that the asylum application if they're coming by land from Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a a lot of potential magnet agree for bringing people here\nUm if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere
