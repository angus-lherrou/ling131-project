then your heat will come out when you least expect it\nAt least in the north when when the weather changes\nYou know it's for the count it's down now what's the goal when it hits it ain't going away for six months\n... same with the ...\n[noise] I noticed they started making snow up in the Rocky Mountains some of the ski resorts now they don't make no if they think it's going to melt that's a waste of water big money but now that this cold has come through they said they're they're making snow because it will stay it is they're building their base\nThe snow was coming earlier and earlier we got two feet of snow\nIn ah North Dakota in October mid October were not even talking Halloween we're talking a middle of October\nKnife it's not on President it's not like oh go board will dry global climate\nChange happens occasionally it it varies that's what we notice about whether whether we're talking ice ages or\nWe'll thousands Iams yeah or whether it was just like last month Democrats caught climate change it well it varies we call it whether climate is always changing it changes every day\nBefore the dash off I Would like to say congratulations to pay it back and her husband James uh Middleton has welcomed the first child fine masculine child of a baby\nBoy born will look abroad can be so happy to hear that because he hopes for a ...\nThat's five seconds out of three days of terror or antifa was was threatening the venue they were giving ... threat to this old lady who answered the phone they're\nGay hang on hang on we're starting to let's go back to what you were doing what the venue is what [laughter] and you have to hit on the poster because uh [laughter]\nI think the poster is a just a entertaining but go ahead\nWell I Try it again with Gucci killed his socialist samurai sword in Nineteen sixty and it's a funny trolls that a lot of right wing guys do it sort of like the tennis shaped thing for your rights helicopter's rights for ...\nAnd early early satire right right so it it it's that kind of set up I announce it on Tuesdays call myself a toy again McAfee and I'd photo shop myself into his mug shot um [noise] the second we announced that and\nAnyone who knows me to know is that a satire antifa\nGoes full blast they started attacking the venue attacking the old lady there the calls are coming from all over the country by the way so this was a planned attack that anti for his work I think DNC and anti for working hand in hand traditional as well organized and well funded\nSo then that those attacks continue night before the venue totally trashed windows smashed ridiculously pretentious manifesto nail to the door that says we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos because we made signed screaming hurling bottles of urine which one of them hit my car on the way out\nA ... ... organized rallies like there's this kind of met that you'll see if you really get deep into the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys over there over there are a citizen journalists get beat up\nThey take his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nThey they arrest the citizen journalist\n... no not try to arrest three of the of the end who mob this guy okay\nBut I had I interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist or pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are um and to FAA Austin is a ... on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what did they call it a\nBlack shirt army or something or read a a red shirt army I Can't remember\n'em but they're calling for people that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... must be the Mets had guy the police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack so now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther King Day I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days\nAnd then when it's time to leave I come out there I've got my plastic sword I make\nA choice which the joke and that's when they hurl the Internet\nMay I jump in the car and then a group of Proud Boys are are the last wants to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter\nThey were attacked by antifa fully clad with all their gear and they throw a bottle at them and a huge fight breaks out and now in your world that fight would have been you know hey cops cops or something like that\nAnd then I'll come actual it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue is we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no gender plan it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side\nKnow so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon\nAnd uh you know Portland has I don't know who this mayor is what I mean what the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing\nWalk away then they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with the super laughing towns like Berkeley and Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say sorry\nTrump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens with someone who likes Trump's shows up on one Republicans and conservatives are around so let's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping off that's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because because the initial video seemed to indicate that your guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from anti throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\nAnd it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative which out doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media ticks five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days subterfuge stays in a domestic violence\nSo almost like I'm at I'm at twenty now I think they don't just like antifa they aren't you so\nI think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have\nTried to be more moderating uh on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick 'em when they're down in all of this stuff\nThere is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole a mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means\nI I don't know what I I don't know what to say I I mean how\nYou and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and noted on conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one\nAnd it's because the the media will throw around the white supremacist like it it I mean absolutely nothing oh it's a crime is this is someone who sees white people as above all other races just inherently better and watch all the other races out of America that is that we're markedly esoteric\nView to have it's it's a crazy if you to have and they just throw it on it and it takes like glue\nAnd it affects our families affects our lives affects our personal lives there's gotta be some culpability there\n[noise] okay so Gavin hold on for a second I Want to I Want to take you over across the break in and just ask you what\nIt is you believe what is the America that you see and that your fighting for [noise] back with Gavin begin is coming up and just a second let me tell you a little bit about gold lying if you\nThink this stuff is going away quickly it's not a if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress we are in we're in for a real wild ride um they are going to subpoena the tax records\nAnd when they don't get the tax records from the White House the White House will bring it to the Supreme Court and then the uh Democrats will say the Supreme Court doesn't have the you know doesn't have a right to do this because of\nOf ah Kavanaugh on and cabinet needs to recuse himself and he's not going to recuse himself then they're going to try to impeach cabin on and they all impeach but Donald Trump I mean it's\nThis what's happening this is what's happening these people are playing for keeps and they are not paying attention to things like oh I don't know the economy isn't as any really heard you know I see the tweets\nFrom Donald Trump all the time I see all the stuff they're saying about Donald Trump as anybody really heard\nWhat's going on with the stock market does anybody really paying attention to what's happening with Saudi Arabia that's a pretty big deal especially when you look at the price of oil a anybody pay attention that nope not in the media\nGold line is put together a I'm a report for you on all of the scenarios that could happen if they take one or both of the houses and they're they're pretty ... you need to be aware of them are because things can change quickly I buy gold and silver as insurance against chaos I and I we are becoming more and more\nBut we we we got here altogether\nThrough all this mess and all this suffering and here we are in the fridge country of the world and we get people complaining thing America was never great and and that's what pissed me off and it's ironic that we ... we get called white supremacist because the reason we love America is it doesn't bother with all of that crap\nGame and we had this for a long time I think the media basically just said antifa was the baby didn't exist they ignore them completely in as the violence has escalated their new tactic seems to be well yes there's violence but it it's the Proud Boys fault or the right wing ...\nHave you noticed or they're just exercising my favorite is they're just exercising their\nFirst Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of course of course I'm curious if you have if you detected a difference recently\nI'm In the approach from the media as is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain and the speakers I mean I I they were you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members and he was re tweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after this you become I think of central\nTarget in this is that you feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying well we we are sick of albino violence was this really weird concept the evil Nazis\nAnd they said we're going to rid America of the clan and Nazis now there are not so they go ... uh we got to expand the net here so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that has to stop and I unfortunately\nHave fallen into that that definition and it it's [laughter] it's amazing that anti ...\nAnd the media and the DNC are all in groups like Cuomo was saying hey this is like a a match and you put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes that I think the matches antifa the wind is the media and it can't be are starting fires\n[noise] I don't I I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there there's you know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\nIt's it's all getting so great I mean they used to and at the same as in Britain by the way the way that it the anti uses and keep their paramilitary kept paramilitary wing here\nOr the media here's the jihad is over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend and then she says language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that now that said we're not still\nThat's what he said when we go low when they go low we kick them or Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no peace or what ever go to their own attack then we've got people on CNN saying that Sarah Huckabee Sanders ... for the rest of her life that's alleged Denton it's at the same thing about Susan Collins\nThey're sending race in two Republicans they got Rand Paul's wife sleeping\nWith the gun we've got senator is getting that text to be heading trick cabinet comes in I mean can you tell the difference in all those stories between people and the DNC they sound pretty similar to me\nGiven McGinnis thanks for other appreciated chairs Douglas\nGavin McGinnis or from see our TV get off my lawn uh [noise]\nThese are the conversations we should be having we should be looking inside and saying what is it I Believe what works what doesn't American Dream\nUsed was

[noise] I\n... some people who haven't read the book I think that it is about um a surrendering or or just making friends with the left and it's not that's not what this is about at all\nIt's about knowing what you believe and then taking a strong stand but with a different approach because times have changed and\nUm and they're getting more and more dangerous and I have\nTalked to you about Martin Luther king for a long time or a somebody who wrote a read my book who [noise] um I really respect they they read it and they said a\nYear about a year to to a head I'm not sure um maybe\nMaybe because I think more people will look at this as things become crazier and crazier maybe but it's not about it's not about\nReuniting with the left because I don't think you can unite with the the left the left has gone insane I think you can with a lot of Democrats and I'm not talking about the ones in Washington I'm not talking about political people I'm Talking about your neighbors but the first thing we have to do is unite\nWith each other we have to unite people people who are or on\nThe right part of the spectrum need to come together we have to come together\nAnd I'm I'm really I I'm I don't like the hey you're on the train or you're not on the train what are you talking about what train where's the train going\nHere's a train that we should all be on\nThe declaration of independence the constitution and the bill of rights because that's why people came here in the first place people die\nIn the middle of the night in the desert to get here because we have a a rule of law be we do not have a class system you can break out if you work hard you're smart and you're a little bit lucky you can break out\nYou can change the world you can invent something in your garage and become Bill Gates that's America that's great\nThat's why people come here and we're losing sight of that until the first thing they have to do is ask are we worth saving and I think the answer across the board I'll bet you eighty percent maybe Ninety percent of America Says yes America is worth saving so what does that mean well capitalism\nCapitalism but not necessarily the way we're doing it\nNow where it's playing favorites the constitution\nBut we haven't been on the constitution or the bill of rights that a long time but we do need a rule of law let me start asking you know just a few questions and I don't care who you voted for I don't care what side of the aisle you're on\nJust answer yes or no do you hate men\nDo you hate white people do you hate black people do you hate Jews do you hate cops do you hate capitalism\nDo you want to shout down others that have a different opinion\n\nDo you want to shout down God or hates God\n\nDo you believe screen to violence is the way we solve things in America\nIf you answered yes to any of those things I don't think I have much in common with you\nBut I don't care who you voted for I'll bet you the vast majority said no to all of those things and it wasn't a hard well I don't know it was no no no no no no no no\nThat's who we are\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with but the easy ones to get by\nThe ones on our own side again and again is that I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge and go and walk through ...\nSinging hymns and let them club you wouldn't ahead go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and knocked punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nGreat than let's stand together and put our our differences of approach aside\nBecause we've got a lot of work to save this thing right\nNow [noise]\nBy the way Gavin has already been silenced on Twitter and voices don't start coming together uh [noise] more are going to be silenced in what was it five or six hundred\nA worst silence last week from Facebook and I don't see anybody talking about it and see anybody talking about and that kind of came and went to the days no big deal [noise] sixty million followers [noise]\nJust

about a half hour ago the program and you're listening when I said what so what is that you believe in what is the America that you see\nI don't see anything that should be shut down I don't think I don't see anything that is dangerous or or any good that comes out from silencing not only him but\nYou know even a crazy man like Alex Jones but cabin is not saying things that are dangerous\nYou know we've always said more voices not less less uh or probably should be not fewer I get those confuse those happening it as a [laughter]\nBut uh you want I mean that's the whole thing here you're supposed to be able to talk about these things openly with people that you disagree with\nAnd ideally right like if you care about something and you're passionate about it you're working on persuading someone else yes right yeah um I don't know that you can get into a situation\nWhere you're on the streets talking to ... that anyone could ever get convinced that anything you know so I mean I it's not that's not where I direct my attention typically but I understand that like you can't have a if I Lived in Portland right now I Will be happy\nThat a organizations were showing up to defend me against anti ...\nUm I I can see that you know when you get to this you get to this point and you you mentioned this earlier when we talked about it in ... twenty Fifteen in Alabama about how\nYou know some point there is going to be these groups doing these things are gonna be ripping people out of their businesses they're going to be doing terrible things are gonna be destroying property so here that's all here\nAnd you know someone has to stand up for it [noise] you know if if it if the mayor is not going to direct the police do it what happens to the average citizen so we're going to go to Brazil next because there is a there's a\nPresidential election going on in Brazil that appears to be pretty frightening and Steve Bannon surprise surprise land in the heart of back\nZones good everywhere ... Google it could be or see on my heart radio um\nSo he wasn't exposed and the fact is I Believe a yes or every country that has relations with Brazil's a has a reason to be concerned because we still don't have any clarity on how will be a ... government\nSo you don't know exactly what's coming she\nShe grew up in a time where there was military rule in Brazil and that was that was overthrown a and democracy came and he has him to the in the past that\nUh that's the way you know you should run a government he has he has called for ... ... what are the Ninety nine a civil war um and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not\nHe's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least he has in the past correct\nAnd he's surrounded by military so ah he's closest advisors today are a military so a a an exception is a\n... a that is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is\nA liberal so we have several different says uh regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's a he's a liberal and he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in Brazil so this is the man that he points\nThat out as a base of the trust in his government but uh\nHe said he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so\nUh it is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very closed government regarding depressed for example he has been using so basic communication tools [noise]\n... ... this is the kind of the time of the same thing that you go Jarvis said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the nationalizing everything is ... is there\nIs that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him but as the military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as here we'll take office and\nImmediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discuss here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution\nA it is not clear how he would do it he has\nA suggested that he could create a council that would ah create a new constitution for Brazil and that would be submitted to a vote for ah after it so and in a console to two people to a electors in general so\nIt he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back once he takes office because the fact is that he's not going to debate he uh is giving I'm\nJust a few interviews and usually he controls the process has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no comfort station from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time\nIncluding because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in if from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do some of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly\nWhat what do those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son Eduardo ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him I'm next to ban in and said that Bannon\nSaid he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this uh this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved the end\nWas responsible in a great part of a bull so not a strategy but a boat so NATO himself a came to public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what we know for a fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ...\nAn expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's a it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's get a presidential candidates son uh and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\nI'm Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth or will have the final result it's very likely the considering the current polls that bill so not a we'll be elected uh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave both so NATO fifty nine\nPercent of valid votes and\nSet it into a dodge ... that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one so it's a big difference and a ... a poll after poll has indicated that uh his electors\nAre very sure of their votes so we we would have to have a a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario but\nUm it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and are lined up some more we'll be following day thank you so much for appreciated okay thank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is deserving about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship or love and passion and ah he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed ma'am\nOh you know but this was the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and and things are bad and\nSo now they're twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy now that this is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock this exactly Alfred Hitchcock with somebody sitting sitting outside\nGoing wait I I I think they shop her up in that case it's a woman I think they've chopped are up and then took her away in the middle of the night and everybody's like no that's crazy ... yep turns out it was\nAnd uh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they dropped him up and took a mountain suitcases that it is the Hitchcock\nRear window and this is obviously gone very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later like this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time\nConstantly killing journalist and they're like I don't even know who I don't even know where that was what is ... ... am I've never even heard of the thing and you know like that that\nTheir pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out in the mid ... yeah we kinda killed that journalists that's a big moment or in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when\nWhen they admit to doing this this is an ally a this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with that most people don't even know that but

hide\nSo um what is the president do what do we do\nThis way you don't get involved in these things because it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did what he don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but I couldn't help me quantify the difference here for a minute\n... these regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not innocent of these things yes is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on in foreign territory in an embassy is it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue\nCan get it can go after a cushion her and and and Trump because of the relationship what ... what do you think\nI say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of that um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nNobody would have been paying attention rather did we got one back and no one yeah nobody seemed to care of this one because it's one of there's\nA the press cares more about it but also foreign soil and you know the suitcase thing it's a pretty amazing story\nLouis you when you were you can do\nThat here he my rainy
