Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee\nAnd he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if\nThat happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should it should to here's here's\nAnybody capital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this\nTour the country apart and it a little what if this was coordinated it ... and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this he should also\nStand some sort of penalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] have him arrested yeah I'd like to be drunk for all of your interviews if that's okay [laughter] and rights do then is it better state\nFor you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true I I Do as fair so um ... there's there's one guy who came out and leveled accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think we're talking about did you see Alyssa mulatto yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed it doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've\nDiscussed this before your interest Allen is you are no we don't care yeah you know if some guy didn't do something like having all whoever it\nMay be and and and you get it and your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation ... doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation it what matters is\nIs communal justice\nLeaving it it is that other people are talking about and\nThe media will never report on is it the same people\nThat organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators about cabinet that same outfits are doing it move on leaves the league alright\nThey've got the mailing list they've got all the information\nI mean I'm sitting there going deja vu yeah same people so now in addition to insanity like Alissa Milan all individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort\nWith tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay we're organizing sending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically the process and\nAmericans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because there's a report it\nWill I Will tell you I I listen to that stupid New York times podcast and listen to it every day just to hear what\nYou know what's being they're putting on it\nUh and it was that it might it made my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy a ... but one of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary\nThey're very scary for reporters and for you know for these senators and and things are getting out of control the do you know\nOf the\nCases [noise] what's your\nMy blood for this is not good my a blood pressure we're checking it against it's science\nTo see if it's better to drink at moments like this do has already had a six pack as the Kavanaugh hearing is going on and Bill O'Reilly is here are my blood pressure's one forty five over Ninety eight and my pulse as one twenty\nOne forty five or Ninety eight that feels like really it's not good I Know that that doesn't seem to look at all I I Want to try to get through or killing the ss what somebody wanted to get drunk first yeah I Know that's how this works [laughter] debate will come out what does it come out that a Tuesday\nOr only has a really good worse war\nCriminals and industry Tuesday advance um\nAnd uh what's already sold Seventy five thousand in advance a sales\nAnd you'll have that and you only have Seventy one thousand in the trunk of your car which is not yeah I Know\nAnd you know the gas is going up it's really\nYou know it's actually a really good book bill ... four minutes or to the vote senator Collins has just voted yes on the advancement she said an ounce her final decision at three PM ...\nAgain I mean 'cause everyone thinks that this vote is going to be consistent with the vote that would happen this weekend or are we really thinking that she's going to change\nThis oh now know she'll vote for oil or Republicans\nWill vote for Kavanaugh because if they don't they're out of the Republican Party\nWell LA cuts it like and he's already out of the yeah he's leaving ... that's\nTrue but I don't think flake wants to go out on that note remember flake wants to get a job as a lobbyist she wants to go around and give speeches maybe write a book if he's got the machine against him that's got to hurt him in retirement as far\nAs good burnings are concerned about where he is still\nI Want to ask you honestly Danes is if for Montana's leaving to go to his daughter's wedding and I was ... there's this is really important vote and who knows what happened in twelve hours even\nIf something goes wrong but I thought that my daughter and I was like you know what I I Would totally leave oh I really my daughters I have used my daughter's wedding none of the right choice yes\nYeah I mean I'm I'm I don't know why they can't work out something on that um you know there are ways\nTo vote 'em but I look you know if your daughter's getting married or do to get married um maybe they could move the ceremony later and they could but I don't know I don't know but you're right you gotta you gotta family first\nAnd there's no reason why these guys have to be there why are we using Seventeen hundreds technology out of the euro some\nReason he could be on a phone\nHigh right right and they could make an exception I think but you're right okay what else\nI'm All right we'll she's believe me I Know on that I thought were going\nThat says if you want me to give\nYou so now we got to give us two minutes on on killing the ss\nI look at the book is about evil and and my contention is that most Americans don't understand the evil my mother didn't she lived a very\nI I read your life yeah she's on me which is obviously\nBut she loved me and thought I was good\nSo they didn't understand evil\nRight right so we're seeing so much evil in America are we not\nUm you know people walking into schools and gunning down kids or clerics abusing children um Chicago where thousands of people are shot by drug gangs and nothing's done opioid epidemic through the roof\nThis is all evil it's centered on evil\nAnd so I wrote ss with an eye on explaining to the reader that these concentration camp guard and the people who kill babies and gashed innocent people were farmers merchants and and bankers they weren't anything trained to do this you weren't assassins\nWere regular people and once the war started they put on the black uniform would the debt said insignia and went into the most horrible things that history has ever seen\nIn the book is better than his explanation a skill that comes out Tuesday\nDo is a big bucks to keep your see on my heart radio\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThey claimed that come in [noise]\nAll right we have a Bill O'Reilly we have Mitch McConnell still ... keep him in

McConnell now\nUh just about I agree but this is the first time I've ever seen ... [laughter] yeah I mean this is about as as crazy as Mitch McConnell get foreign hatch behind him sleeping I'm not kidding on as I say I am yeah he is leaving\nNo but he's now he's the he's doing his mantra he just what\nI mean you could ... it might have been the might've been praying option of at NIH or an end mantra is I Want to go home\nYet by leans bully\nHatch that really funny uh uh and now for a nation where they protest during the elevator and does all they did you see that bill yeah I thought yeah I mean like you know and and it's interesting to see on the ... how\nThe protesters didn't care what he said they were looking for running an opportunity to yell at him they'd had nothing to do with with the kind of what he said\nWell the more you yell louder you are the more you get paid there is a scale of of yelling and if you reach a crescendo you get more money for move on\nHey let me let me ask you this and we're ... on by the way created to move on from sexual assault allegation ought to remember that and that was Bill Clinton move on from the Monica Lewinsky thing or early yeah it's amazingly Phil around at this point in the me too movement right bill me\nWell what about cats are the main lawyer for Christine toward she is she a exonerated Al Franken our income on these ... I'm\nAfraid are actually look everybody or any buddy ... anybody and honoring about Amish knows what this is an knows what's going on\nAnd we'll do you think this will play out this way at the voting booth do you think there are whom do you think there are I think Democrats Democrats not I'm not talking political players I'm Talking about regular Democrats who are seen as now and go and you know I was for you know for it and I wanted a fair thing but this is ridiculous\nThey're asking for people to um\nBasically changed their opinions that's very\nRare all scientific studies on politics show that people loads to change their opinion they don't like to admit they were wrong and that's\nAll right it's just human nature but what this is going to do is give the Republicans I'm a real long point one two punch with\nThe economy [noise] the the economy and then you have this corruption on the other side that I Would frame it\nAll right hang on we're getting ready to take the vote let's just listen just in for just a second wave your\nQuestion is is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the nomination Brett Kavanaugh Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to close the ... the nays are mandatory under the rule the clerk will call the wrong\nIsrael and the and I'm like I haven't missed Baldwin\n...\nBennett finished to Mr Blumenthal of\nIs your business and noticed that in St Louis has been around yeah\nStripper\nCantwell the\nCapital man American history this is a pivot point 'cause their cart what does this mean the bill for history district case either direction [noise] the cat um\nI don't know yet I mean I Can't speculate on that I can just I Know I'm pretty good at at a value waiting the mood\nOf the country you may remember that five days before the election to thousands sixteen I predicted Trump would win and I predict it because people didn't like Hillary Clinton would stay home I mean that was my best that I ever\nDid in ... right now I Am feeling it everywhere I go I Know a lot of people and I'm\nAround okay that's a regular folks know this was a sham and they know the cabin on his family were damaged very badly by people who didn't care to seek the truth they know that\nThat I think will play out at all politics but you got to remember is a powerful powerful corrupt lobby that is driving me to thing and the media\nHow how though if she's voting not to advance the nomination to the\nFloor well now if she voted yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I ... I'm going to vote yes\nMaybe but I see a that's a pretty tough line\nOn yeah I don't think he's going to do it but it is interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote results of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots\nAre in that Senate campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I don't\nThink so I don't think so they are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent uh and we'll wait and see Bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot of a

brightest end of my knowledge is really like\nSmoke pot and then went to Taco Bell like that's all I I Know the ... eighty thousand foot view of that life but he was talking about like Christian culture growing up in church just south of sports like these are kinda area where I live like\nRight out of this bit of this was like a lady that has a Bible verse for every type of situation and people like how did you memorize all those versus like\nThat in my ... that's just I I live that life and it's just in my head I run them memorized let's just do it so you're going to be a great comic you stick to what and you know and a lot of people say you should like when I went I Lived in Hollywood for four or five years and they were like hey you need to get rid of this like Christian\nAngles because it doesn't appeal to everybody\nReally you're ... you cannot get tickets to any of your show\nYeah well I apparently somebody's coming down right yeah\nBut I don't think it you don't think

who\nWho's performing you would think like the Beatles yes I wanted to like some kid I never heard of yeah it's it's it's amazing to me that I ... I was amazed me where you don't have to just go see\nIn comedy is very subjective so you could love someone it'd be like Glenn check this guy out and you could be like not for me yeah right yeah 'cause comedy is very ... subject you can't tell them if you can tell him it's not funny right what this guy's funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced the harvest so\nUh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you the he looked like somebody\nYou don't want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders is like I I look like Glenn Beck I Know [laughter]\nI was going to go into a different direction I don't know if\nYou heard this more feel like they look like Dave Ramsey with hair [laughter]\nDavid

like telling us the truth out here you know what I'm saying and that's what people I think comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go I think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you\nHave to say anything right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say that most profane mhm disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but in in two thousand anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of coming back to like a Jimmy Fallon type\nI I I said years ago that I thought the only thing left shocking\nWas what up

about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians in here we're driving down the road and seen that cyclists on the side of the road I Wonder if I just like [laughter]\nLike why is that why does why why everyone vet\nThat joke has stayed in my show for about four years because it every button yeah once you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy and we all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is that got now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some ... some might\nActually some of the reason why\nThe the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like\nIf if if we can notch him down I feel\nLike that's why the tabloids exist that's wiping with her the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay how are you [laughter]\nSo schools everywhere over to Google and keep your CD on hard Rubio\n[noise] [noise]\nOh man [noise]\nFor them to the program we're glad to

I've seen them they're huge yeah they are in that show it really is it really is into who could be more surprised than all of us but\nThen you get a you know who's also doing really well\nA fat so fast so yeah without until June while I'm fat the podcast the fat with Jeff Fisher is like I Know would people like Jeff people\nLove Jaffe and ... to us because we hate him we\nLike ... him I Know I had to write a and so I had to write a memo to all of the you know producers and everybody involved in\nTeam fat and uh and I was like I'm nobody can be more surprised than me\n... really bad guy but yeah you know it out in the ... really impressive\nAll right so a pat gray from pat gray unleashed welcome to the program glad you're here\nI'm Glad to be here to argue this yeah yeah I I'm a I'm a it's\nA forty or fifty one forty nine Kavanaugh so they will vote tomorrow however there is one vote for the Republican side that is going away\nI'd love to get first your gut reaction and then let's talk about it okay because my gut reaction was clear and then thinking about it I'm like well now wait a minute you're a Republican senator you are a you're going to vote for Kavanaugh is this close\nYet your daughter is getting married on Saturday ... interview cannot cast\nYour vote in any other way you have to be there your across the country so it's one or the other my gut was see America I'm with my daughter\nYeah right yes okay now let's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah promote Montana okay so senator Danes from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them\nEither this is one of the most important in game changing votes a of maybe his lifetime\nOr it will if if the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this to anybody\n...\nHow do you ... 'cause my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still won the vote without his they may not or if they're at fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to be parents well no\nWell yeah I mean it but again let's say mentioned switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican [laughter] so let's say ... signifies today that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow\nSo it's instead it forty nine forty or not it's not a sure thing you need Danes\nI've got to say like my it into a hardware that your gun was titled with my daughter but in ... and the end you you rethink that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be moved for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it's sick started at three and I'll be there\nAt the ... vote right like move the vote\nYeah you know they're they're planning on doing by the way if they need ... they're going to delay the holy until he comes back oh Gees delayed the vote well only if they need them right now he doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just ... ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow it to no\nNo they can relate to it on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's that risk of like you know some new accusations during a crazy thing that happens you know with the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Houston", "day": "05"}
