{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "However I as a cruise Cornell than I Will of course uh put everything aside to get there as quickly as possible this may be why Nikki Haley is resigning because of that statue I Am and I guess that that's not the case well they did say she told Trump\nLike six months ago that she was going to need a you know to kind of move on\nBy the end of the year or is she she's going to go skiing that's what it is she's got ski time\nSays I'd like to go skiing at the end of the year doesn't mean everybody needs to it and she quit her job well just to go on a little ski trail otherwise\nThey're going to be bugging her\nA crisis in the middle east hey there's a crisis you know well\nMaybe she plans to ski the whole season\nWas ... yeah yeah well I won't get out there and just get real good you don't get good in a week ... rich\nMy guess is she has one of those passes ... and she probably has a place for like eight hundred dollar path that she's ski and ski out kind of play ... and if even path\nSoon go all the time I I\nHad no time for no a\nCrisis I got a season pass here every day I don't use it I'm wasting\nBoy must be nice yeah I think it must be [noise] I Know I Will never know\nBut that's okay this is Nicky doesn't call us we have to guess at these things so that if you want to stop us from guessing about your problems your calls\nAnd so that means your annual drive by a ... and on into you know northern New Mexico there are still on your own baby you're heading for the Iraqis you know you're busy you people and you're happy to see what will blow the horn\nProbably flashlights when we come through your town or or you know while the jobs and just uh came to see you\nYeah but I'm\nGoing to stop and buys a meal or something on our way through oh sure\nGot a couple of hot spots I like to hear what did you like to eat a Christmas tree flavored potato chip no not really I don't know why\nPeople come up with these things that's how I first of all I don't think I've eaten a Christmas tree I don't even know what one tastes like\nA potato chip company and England has started selling Christmas tree flavored potato\nChip town as a Christmas tree tastes like who knows my dog knows a salty tiny would V. taste that's not right now it's a salty tiny would the smell but we don't we don't know what the tastes tastes like I I Would imagine the taste is something like kale\nAnd I know this aggravates you beyond belief Everytime Oreo comes out with something no dammit now what do they do and Christmas tree over twenty seven flavor\nAs something like that I Know if you doubled stuff Oreos had\nA lot of cream and I'm getting ready for the most stuff Oreo cookies but just now coming out with most of which will have more cream that any Oreo produce\nAmmo most most most most stuff okay I Will say that they've top that that means they can't do more because they've already done most [laughter]\nDouble the double stuff for you they are talking about quadruple\nStuff village named most laughed is to go stuff only have any Oreo cookie you're up there in the lobby of the white cream nothing but it's nothing cookie that can happen but I don't doubt it they will be doing it bridges country\nFull of idiots that can ... I mean they do sell cookie dough that people eat\n... eggs cookie dough now absolutely\nIt's not meant to bake if it doesn't even have instructions how to bake it no most to buy it either this cookie that will just put it in a two block astronaut get just just squeeze it in ... what was wrong with buying a cookie dough\nAnd they'll just eat and out of the two without may be good enough for us all these years I mean if that's what led you to eat ... Ito to begin with why would you have to have special go do it but it may just eat aggravated they get their God\nThe point is if it ain't broke don't fix it an Oreo went and started kicks and stuff that wasn't broken now they just\nThe perfect cookie\nYou know it's like a I'll give you an example it's like how we used to have in cars in the fifties we\nUsed to have a button that was a starter mainly trucks but some cars to hit a button that was a starter on the floor right by the gas pedal\nNow later they modernized by moving all the functions into just a key to us the kids don't need to push any button 'cause the key to west what's wrong with the key to key and now you don't even have to do that we do now keep in your pocket what's called what's cool now is to have a key\nBut can't do anything no you have to push the button our darn we're back to a button aren't we but it's a button is less convenient is on the dash it'd be better for all the forward you just step on the road there by the gap really is just dumb\nThat Denver switch having the dimmer switch on your foot I'll be sure and tell them\nSo how do we do it\nThat's what I talk about in the book addicted to outrage and we're taking your calls and questions and comments on it if you have read it uh let me go to Anthony in Massachusetts hello Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck program\nPeg what how are you good are you\nDoing well so you know what can you you you mentioned earlier that are really that the opposition are the people leading the leadership the Democrat Party or or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there I Would have party members they\nWork every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk of the American population being being a ... for the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a different an unusual and virtually or people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they're seen their side being unreasonable violence if you see anti FAA the way to answer ... is not\nWith uh the militant people that will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets\nThat is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and just is peaceful and gentle and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly\nAs we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country with those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group\nYou have to act while they're still is a Judeo Christian value and we're losing it quickly\nSo to get to the far left will never do that but get to the people like you're talking about you have to develop ways\nTo be peaceful and not part of that angry crowd it's what I've talked about for Twenty years there's going to come a point where everybody's going to be running in a certain direction and you're gonna have to have your credibility\nYour kindness you're gonna have to be able to stand up and say no wait don't don't go that way you're not going to stop the whole crowd\nBut you'll be able to stop enough thanks Anthony will send you a book or let me go to a Heather in Virginia hello Heather you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how are you I'm very good [noise] um I\nOverall agree with every book I think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're um you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with everything that you've said that we need to at least have a conversation about\n... because of it and I you\nKnow I think we need to be careful about even\nI'm considering heavy I I think that there really isn't fair\nOr am I to try to come in ... and ... that's what it is something that they want to push ups are socialism I think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other technical or a\nNomination where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their ... their problem correct and\nSo um I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create the\nMachines and keep running you know there are certain things I just can't they don't like um ... uh fixing\nUp a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think many people are going to be upset if they got into the tunnels and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet isn't known for their service and I sat\nLet me ask you this let me ask you that first of all just a ... ... ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this or ... or ... what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than they work unless I'm so I'm coming to you know a different perspectives\nAre having to sit there for a church that I Know that you have sure on that\nBut you know just my feeling like a a I is going to absolutely be able to diagnose cancer a quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nSo Heather are there is a there and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but a while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment but no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nIs different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that is seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it it's I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before and we're about to experience that\n\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm\n...\nMy ... probably ...\nNikki Haley has resigned as the messenger to the un will have more on that coming up\nAlso an incredible our we try to take seven people and put them in a room all of them from different backgrounds and tried to have a reasonable discussion about\nGuns can you get all different viewpoints into a room the entire spectrum and get them to agree on anything regarding guns he didn't turn out the way we expected a hit it actually\nTaught us something really important that we have that coming up next our\nAs we sent ... foot tall out ah to do or even bidding or let's go to Kelly in\nOregon jeeze God Bless you Kelly how are you ... how are you\nDoing I'm good but I don't have an to running cities in my state so\nI Know I Know it's a little bit scary here and alert and have it I Want it or it it it is actually um I I live in Springfield which is a little bit more conservative\nThan other places but I wanted to say thank you for your book I'm listening to it I'm On audio so it's it's a lot of fun you did a great job thank you um I I wanted to say thank you for your effort says it and the food section [laughter]\nA little misleading because I think I talk about food [laughter] well let me let me tell you should let it is where\nWhere do you take it I'm a than McDonalds one and the um the thirty\nOne flavors of Baskin Robbins okay\nIt cleaning President Trump I um had been able to use the references\nAnd saying that there are some good things about him to my liberal friends and you don't have to like everything about him but there are some good things that many like McDonalds I mean like the French fries so you don't have everything about McDonald's you like to fry is right\nAnd so I've been able to kind of ... that in a joking way and kind of get them to maybe see a little bit of I like him a little bit you don't have to like him personally so anyways I just really enjoyed that\nPart of your book and being able to use a cause I can laugh about it yeah we can laugh without food and\nSo anyway Kelly thank you thank you very much stay strong\nIn Oregon or will send you a copy of the book saying to you I'm listening to the point I make in the book about McDonald's is\nIt's one way you can tell if people are being disingenuous if you have nothing good to say about someone I mean nothing everything is bad\nReally\nI mean even even people who are you know a wood trying to say something good about Adolf Hitler\nOr the Audubon the Audubon okay doesn't really our balance that are outweighed the other but oh okay you can't find anything and I compared the news coverage to a bunch of people who are just telling you that everything about McDonald's sucks\nEverything if they don't mention that they okay but I got to tell you the fries are the best fries ever if they can't admit that McDonalds fry is superior even if they hate everything else they're not an honest broker they're not an honest broker\nIt's called the Nick muffin too by the way a about ... I could go on and and I could have but I didn't let me go to Aaron in Indiana hello Aaron\nHey Glenn what an honor it is to uh speak with you thank you sir I'm after reading the book I mean I had a a roller coaster ride of different\nEmotions and the thing that struck me the most is the algorithms um that are being programmed you know retaining life and death and I'm I'm as\nA nation I I haven't even heard of it before your book and then nobody speaking about it\nYeah and it's kind of a big one isn't it I'm trying to remember what it's called the uh what is it from MIT sue remember I brought that in\nA it's a shoot I Can't remember what the name of it is now a from MIT but MIT is now doing research on who lives in who dies it's basically the complete lives system except it's going to be for your\nAuto driving car ...\nAnd it will be able to know who's in the car who's on the sidewalk who's in the crosswalk it will know their value to society what their job is how old they are are they sick or they well and it will calculate in a fraction of a second who dies who lives where to steer the car\nSo smart and your smart speaker looks really creepy or see on your radio [noise]\nHi Michelle mountain here one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit gods now\nNow the woman goes into a funny comes out down there is no police report and\nI

I mean the most hardcore progressive to the most hard core conservative and get them in a room and get them talking about\nGuns and school shootings and can we\nTry to get all of them to come to an agreement on anything will they listen to one another can you foster this conversation we learn something that we didn't expect were you surprised by all of this do\nYeah and then it it was a it it's an enlightening a journey kind of through there 'cause you could see that\nIt's not as easy as you want it to be a you know we all the all the hesitation that we always talk about you know dealing with people who disagree with you it's hard sometimes van and like that you know they say things that are so stupid you feel like and they just want to and you wanted to\nVisit I don't I don't want to give away the I don't want to give away the discovery here because it's not what I Would have expected and in in many ways you understand why it happened you absolutely understand\nOne side will not understand it the other side will understand that um but any fair person looking at the whole thing can go ah\nIt and it's an amazing science experiment it really is now ... is so so what do we do with this um well we had him put together a group of people and had him the meat and some conference room\nAnd just have a conversation with male female or you know\nVery liberal very progressive very conservative very Christian\nYou know all of them all walks of life and have a conversation about school shootings we\nYou through that journey a next with the audio and re as a joined us and it is truly ... it's truly important and in\n[noise] and you will learn something really I think important yeah I mean\nYou know you usually don't force yourself to be in these situations and that's why it's kind of access science experiment right like I feel like at the sort of stuff happens less and less in America where people are just like honestly trying to talk about a an uncomfortable issue that weird thing that we say about like don't talk about religion or politics is like\nA it's it's understandable and I avoid them all the time you know a party 'cause I don't want to deal with it but it does hurt the way that we actually um ... our ability to persuade people to our point of view or maybe to learn something that we didn't consider\nWell you know if you were a missionary the last thing you would do is go over to Asia and tell them how stupid Buddha\nIs yeah and that's what we're doing yeah the Westboro Baptist church is cash signs over like God hates Buddha it's not going to be a fact that it's not going to work and and uh especially the left is using the Westboro Baptist church tactics you are\nBecause it you know politics has become religion for a lot of people we can't do that you will not sway anyone anyone and remember somebody has been swayed who was a family member in the Westboro Baptist church mhm how did it happen\nWill not be holding signs\nHours in the pocket so they are right\nAnd we demonize each other even more in the endless gun debate that\nFollows the guys are still fat free learning and memory was much more concerned with moral issues none of your way at All right\nLet them in a time and we accept it and we accepted\nFor long we want to add to our\nApproach to debating the says you know ... the second amendment and you support mass killings and certainly there something in the middle\nNight we all want the same exact thing to keep all those French toast eating kid thinks\nSo this is my question in an increasingly divided America how do we worked together to achieve the same thing\nKeeping our children's safe at school\nSo what's your weeks ago I asked seven very different American to sit down with me and help me find an answer and we did\nWe found an answer but it wasn't at all what I thought it would be the answer as it turns out to my complete surprise he's a single digit number [noise]\nA number that was hastily written on a ... posted dumped and passed over to me with a handful of others as part of a kind of warm of exercises the seven were just sitting down to begin our conversation as you hear me read all the numbers down to the group several weeks ago three ten ten or ... [noise]\nKeep in mind one of them is our answer forward\nLet me start by telling you about the seven\nI Am and the high school teacher a mother of three boys three teenage boy I Am a fire little stricter\nI was a police officer in Arlington please continue for thirty seven years\nI wanted their politics to be very very different\nI Would be probably considered a constitutional conservative\nI find the older that I get the more progressive and liberal but I become I Am very much on on both sides I always vote for the person that scares me to\nEven wanted their experiences and feelings about guns to be different\nWithout a shot down in the closet cans or not he had a shotgun I'm I'm a retired navy combat pilots\nHave guns in our home they're locked out I've never seen them I don't want to see them last me I started shooting I just asked my dad and his redneck buddies out in the country [noise]\nThese seven words thoughtful well informed good hearted people who all agreed to spend an entire evening talking to people they didn't even know why\nTo come up with a list I wanted to find a list even if it was a very short one up specific practical things that we could all agree upon to help combat this intangible threat to our kids that we all think from time to time\nAn intangible threat that a ... a teacher in the room explain from the perspective of being inside the schools each and every day\nAnd any time there is any sort of anything out of the norm at school and the kids get weird they get fat and it's just a feeling among the entire school\nThan something tried fully wrong and I think it all over the country I think that you hear and noise in the hallway when you're ISIS quiet and everyone had turned\nWith that awareness we begin talking\nThe story of that conversation has two parts the content that dumped up with that and then the impact what happened because of what was said so content as we searched for the list for almost four hours\nI'd like to share with you the three biggest impediments we came up against because in this new era of communicating and communication I think there was considering remember same children same goal\nImpediment number one opinions outnumber people I Do realize that in this age of unlimited access to opinion that although there were seven people physically sitting around me there were many more opinions and voices brought into our conversation\nListened to the following exchange between two mothers Anna\nA progressive and Mona a Christian conservative\nAnd see how many people's opinions and perspectives are brought into the mix other than their own\nFrom my side what I hear in\nOh you don't infringe on any of my right and I don't want any restrictions on myself and it's kind of and I'm not going to cut you off but it has kind of anti bank at Penn and play\nAre reasonable idea if we can come up with that line going inconvenienced\nBy and you're right there are probably solutions there and you are reasonable\nBut that leaders movements are not raising of guy that fast why is that when there's a school shooting or last shooting someplace first thing we share\nWhen he'd gotten control and they enter a it's a bad\nSo many other opinions and voices most of them extreme jumped right into our conversation on minute thirty nine everything was heightened from the get\nBeneath our firearms instructor who almost missed a round table because she had food poisoning speaks about the problem with letting other people speak for on ...\nSure we can you can do they accept the Cape fear the when I hire rainy um\nHow surprised were you that\nThis fell apart\nBecause to me that's where they all it right there yeah I was not just shocked but personally got it because I found all these people and with the best of intentions I said look out there in the world no one's talking let's try and create this environment at the seven amount that we can\nGo past that we'll we'll know each other you're all good people and I could not believe that with all that ... of them coming in that the the guards went up and because you're not granted it's not the seven people it's\nAll of the voices that are in each of their heads that they're all battling I understand why he said what he didn't cut her off and it has nothing to do with the people in that real exactly the people in that room\nCould compromise could potentially identical yet and so if I if that was their community and it was only about them they could come up with it\nThe next day I ... I ... couldn't get out of bed and when I looked at my phone there was this flurry of text and email from other people in the room saying how deeply meant we all tried we missed so what did you find out\nWell what was interesting was one of the tax was an invitation from Denise our firearms instructor to do and I'm a progressive activists mother saying you want to continue the conversation why don't you come down to the shooting range and we can and and so I can beat this and Anna accepted in a second shock and\nSo the next day the progressive activists went to the shooting range at the base of being a raise building to continue the conversation with the firearms trainer and that's where we go now\nPersonally take out an air contain OK okay\nGround started off on a twenty two semiautomatic handgun very low risk well\nOK then as I Am one nervously watch them engage each other woman won the memory of their interaction from not even forty dollar prior was still pretty ... [noise]\nThe cars at high Karen said as I got\nHouse they began this new conversation with basic [laughter]\nSo how do you take the safety off they keep the safety on and then it\nIt ... it depends on the specific type of\nFire says this one\nAnd then they started talking more specifics to be honest Denise explaining some of the existing gun laws that don't make sense\nThat if someone were to hold this like this\nAgainst our shoulder and we are now shooting at like\nOf the law and you're technically\nA felon man why would there be an issue if you're holding it as a writer ... why why why would it be considered illegal because now\nThe the I'm Wondering if he chooses not registered as a rifle you didn't ... but she purchased that has a pistol and now you're shooting at as a rifle they're saying\nYou're in violation of law\nAgain complete makes absolutely no sanctions\nAnd then this happened and they were talking about bullet\nTrain all a much larger bullet tons more powder that says a three hour wait so that's a typical hunting around they can just see that the different than the power and penetration to train the bullet and the amount of powder that goes in\nThe ... [laughter]\nAnd as they giggled over a size joke that was it\nThe enemy lines work there anymore between them and it would no longer on versus them and ... they were on the same side just two people trying to figure something out new they connected me\nTo come on [laughter]\nThis is Anna coached by Denise do her first shot at a little\nAnd for the record for ... was just dumped doubles and afterwards they started talking specifics again but there was a willingness to work together and limit the number of opinion to their own\nSo it's like OK rather than you and I like meeting in the parking\nLot or something that got are aware but\nOn me to make sure you know\nI'm not selling insurance\nOr nearly until the next thing you know what I mean I'm", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "09"}
