J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he wasn't guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believe he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and and let me tell you\nI think a doctor's poured who testified she's a serious person she as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt her testimony\nAh I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nA just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least its severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so\nThe fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how\nPeople get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support\nThe evidence just isn't there right you don't crucified someone with zero evidence and then what you're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I\nI saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat or who uh has not lost his footing a with with reason um so the address people\nAddress people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper ready to be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right the if the guy's calendar clears him right\nThe testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to cast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that's the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic\nWhere we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way this is in a court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline of when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is to plead guilty by association ride mark judge I I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of the country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based off his own memoirs of somebody who is a very troubled person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not bred cabinet but he we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine\nBut we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations\nJust because we disagree with them politically or ideologically that's insane that's what they do in in in ... republic spending third

with the ... information\nI I think we look I I'm not happy with the weight wet at all\nBut I Am I'm okay with an investigation I don't think it's a bad thing we shouldn't assume someone's bad because one person says anything we do have to have innocent until proven guilty that's important and unless proven guilty that does matter that I work with with criminal defense attorneys all the time and that's a critical issue we have a situation where\nSomeone's accusation is harsh that means the person is guilty\nWe don't want that we want people to decide are they guilty or not yeah otherwise I can simply use accusation that's a weapon right I don't like Glenn you killed somebody right now well killing someone is a serious accusation therefore Glenn should lose it you know his ability to be

you know for prison reform that's the problem with our ... that's why we need prison reform one of the reasons is because you know it it it has been unjust at times and we need to make sure it's the

either\nWere even how do I let you be you you let me me me and we can all be free to gather\nOne of the times had work it has words\nThat's our original idea we just haven't done it in a long time so so Larry tell me your day one you're governor of New York what do you do\nThere are several things that have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote because a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to have three percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be with you when this is the most important single election in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more broadly as a whole but as one single election if\nI come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nAnd it does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this ... this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed and they know it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our protection the Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant it's just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties that's supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] name will be a massive\nMassive culture shock within within the uh the state of the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus
