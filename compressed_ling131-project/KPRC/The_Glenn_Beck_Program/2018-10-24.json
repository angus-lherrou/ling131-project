things probably I don't agree with we all need to dial it down but\nAh I ah I I it's not right and and and and we just need to ... it's it's just ... gland it's hard to say everybody in their heart needs to look at what we're going through right now it's not getting any better it's not getting more civil it's who can do more to the other side\nAnd uh you know I I guess I Would say in my world it started the baseball field and I know who started that and what it wasn't the it wasn't that it wouldn't have a a conservative on the Republican side start\nYou know right before the civil war um some there was a beat and with a cane by a by a a\nA a congressman and the will of the Senate and uh he almost died nobody they didn't they didn't even arrest the congressman nobody said anything about it uh and in\nFact they they made little they took the pieces of wood and made little Keynes and they wore them around their neck as a as a badge of honor that you know don't mess with our party cars will beat you to death\nMhm uh I mean I I when I read that years ago I thought well we're a long way from civil war but I'm not sure we are that far from that kind of barbarism\nWell unfortunately

maybe about two years yeah uh and uh have you learned your lesson ready to come back ah yeah I think where where are you are also the managing editor for faith wire dot com\nOr and or and you've done some projects with us we have an upcoming project on\nIsrael but you are here to talk about a project that you're working on about pornography\nYeah we uh we've created a resource now because\nI'm you know this issue isn't going away and when you look at culture and you see how broken culture is that the number one area that it's broken in his in issues related to sex and sexuality and gender I mean we can't even look at people and say\nYou're a man or woman at the trigger some sort of reaction and everyone is up in arms about it and so you have a culture that's gone completely off the rails\nAnd so what we're doing as we've sort of press the reset button on that and we've sort of gone back to ground zero on how to guide design sex how to guide design sexuality and\nAnd so where we zeroed in on was porn because we think porn is the main driver of that dysfunction that we're seeing in culture and the numbers are more staggering now than ever before\nOr in churches only nine percent of churches have actually resources dedicated to it so that's why we created a set free course dot com or so that people can go and and so that hopefully churches use it and and take a look at it and really it just presses the reset button on how God designed\nSex 'cause you know sex is a dirty word often in some circles but\nUm and people sort of pushed that over but God created it you know God designed it for our benefit\nIt's really quite amazing we were watching something I don't remember what it was and we were [noise] my wife and I were talking about\nAh the medieval times ... enemy all times you know uh\nIt was a sign of wealth and beauty of your teeth were rotted because they just discovered sugar so that meant that you were full of sugar yeah it was yeah yeah you had lots of food um they used to use ear\nWax is chap stick ah you know [laughter] I said I said all addiction to sexuality and with that comment I said I said I\nCan't even imagine kissing or being near somebody back then the God yeah it was brilliant with the sex drive [laughter] because it'd be like how many and you'd be like new thank you how do you how to you know it'd be stronger than it is that yes I think\nYou're right but for those who want to tear that apart and tear that vision of our where's the where is the lowest hanging fruit I mean you're talking about that sex drive we'd go off the rails with it what what is the lowest hanging fruit to break up the family and screw up you know a ... effects were\nWere idiot guys we we we fall for everything I Know it doesn't you know it doesn't take much\n... and that's all right\nSo and and the numbers of bears this out I mean and even among Christians that's where the shocking thing it's like culture it's like everyone's got the rope or now I mean the numbers or eighty percent of people all people as being foreign like you know an unfair especially from guys but Christians are not immune to this and so\nThis ... this study from bar that came out recently sixty five percent two thirds of Christian men have viewed porn\nThey they view at about at least monthly they admit to that so many things thirds of Christian men\nAnd the porn is not like when I was growing up you know there was one kid\nHad a playboy magazine you know what I mean you have a shame you don't go into like if I'm you know like concrete no building and like your car would be there'd be like all very goes in the ... like no and it's and it's not that way now now we are and he is\nThe worst of the worst now it's degrading\nNuclear easy to get up every ... everywhere and\nAnd the ... and the real shocking that Glenn is not only is that the case with technology and the prevalence but among young people where it's most prevalent Eighteen to twenty four year old men now the numbers show that\nThey view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean you're a guy you're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a\nRape is completely undefined I mean you know I asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now I hear rapist
