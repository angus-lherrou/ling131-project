thought most successful nation in the history of mankind needs to be brought low because of budget globe of us want to control us\nWell I haven't [laughter] not not today Mr not\nOn Monday no not\nOn this Monday for damn sure maybe Tuesday I don't know probably blew up a little bottom are maybe Wednesday you know we're coming here a little worked up on Monday oh yeah for the weekend or you know we've got the weekend work up gone down [noise]\nWe can do never as good as they were when you're younger remember when you're younger boy you leave on friday and and the week it was just so glorious wonderful place where the\nKinds of good stuff happen remember those days usually fix for what they've always got to be some sex of the week yeah it's not the case anymore not always a or yeah and a\nLot of fun was going to be a lot to a pain free time you'd have a little pain free time as you get older those things are labor the William ... means that you come in Monday\nSo early [laughter] so ... yeah yeah\nAnd that's a yeah that's probably good balance because there's a lot of young people that are still feeling happy yet that Monday morning euphoria that carry over a mistake to block off certain um\nOf the day or time for you to enjoy yourself that's true yeah because you get in a rut we shouldn't think of Monday through friday is world court days and then Saturday and Sunday and it's like we try to enjoy yourself every day you don't want\nTo and there was nothing wrong with enjoying yourself while you work will do a lot of people say work is work\nAnd fun it's fun why can't work be fine you work a little fun into your work you know what I'm saying yeah let's say you\nOr your job is a given women Brazilian wax jobs at your job okay I'd\nProbably be pretty good at that nobody in here is going to have that job probably yeah they won't allow you and and I'm not going to volunteer\nWell we're all you have a little fun you're maybe uh you don't do it the way they ordered it up and you put like Hitler mustache down there will maybe it'll just have to come back for a second bill round you take some\nPictures you put it on your Instagram or what ever offered to you because of that you think ah 'cause we're like\nA fiber like for the phone and our ... ... ...\nNot having any fun boy oh boy\nWhat's wrong with having a a big old belief right before you do something you know\nOne more monkey story in the news before we run according to this headline Drew Brees got a monkey off of his back last night with the game with the Baltimore Ravens\nBecause he beat every team that there's ever a bad he's only guys ever beat every team right\nOh was that what they're talking about okay I thought they were being racist but I'm assuming you ...\nAs in you took a nerd and she might like so many people do more you have to be careful as like the Houston museum with the spoke the same thing you took that out of context I'm keeping an eye out\nFor just such things and ah I don't like you know the news people to say stuff\nLike that may be a record Tom Brady can never touch because Tom Brady would have to quit the patriots go to work for another team before he could ever be patriots right only two other quarterbacks\nBetter mouse trap or apple or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics is in the end\nSo come completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left\nThey are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are\nThey're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at what\nPoint do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a\nTo Nancy Pelosi in California how are you know where does did to Mitch McConnell Elaine Chao and Kentucky exactly\n... because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up and violence and this is not saying by the way\nThat people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do but screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to Secretary Chao who served in President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have\nPersuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a which had strep pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out and leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta\nAnd taking a beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... of phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of ... restored downtown and Omaha right now\nAnd there's no end to fight here and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about ... today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties\nSixty eight percent of Americans any given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that met an ... basically\nNinety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it was shared content\n... there was an American way when you fought with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two there are still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media\nAs if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope\nFor viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignoring them [noise]\nSo what is our our we I mean I've spent\nThe last two years and the thing that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our ... or ...\nYes ... a a pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest\nAll of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat's way bigger than their policy preferences and so what is unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a\nPeople are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness and ruthless\nIt's almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community you have a theological framework to make sense of death and suffering and forest and statistically the number one driver of happiness\nIs do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning\nWhen you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships\nAnd the undermining of vocation or long work um ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about with deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this a and a year looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we are talking to Ben\nSasse his new book is

really factor here for a while\nA and I got to a place where my pain in the last few years have been it's just been off the charts and\nDidn't know what to do about it anymore I could not go to the doctor and you know hey can you give me some drugs I just don't want to live my life\nThat way and I needed to be able to be out of pain what am I going to do my wife finally said 'cause I'm I'm a

fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take that Russia type investigation so seriously us because China's right behind them running scout\nTeam all fence I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns\nLike Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every\nSide of every issue the NFL dealing controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stand for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russian on both sides and so we're\nGoing to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings where all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying art as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them\nA why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposures for this country and how much we hate each other around politics we need communities of people that live in the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise] [noise]\nHow come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\n[noise] ah it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack\nSome of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some that job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of ... pecking\nAnd so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you

K through ten the last two years of high school for too many kids is\nJim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college was terrible and I got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say\nI Wonder why he has no work ethic we've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is when people show up at the clock in the morning there's just so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college the problem is we've been told ally\nAnd the lie is the only way to have success in this country is to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that\nSo it's sixteen let's not make some decisions if I think called you right for me I go to a two year prep school to prep schools is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready to graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who then we go back to the gate not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story down okay\nYeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school and they should be born school\nYou don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school\nGo to trace could become a plumber a carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough and Yossi to doing it's a problem\nSo do that we don't like that go get a job\nNot go learn ... work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people in my generation I just don't have to go work learn what it means to have a boss learned means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nLoudly sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here you're sixteen you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use good luck\nHis ... his wife ... going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up yes how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars going day well\nI don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most guaranteed government money yes they do so they will absolute give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when these schools pop up now we're spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... state spends twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each\nTwelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelfth graders is more than four billion dollars we've said all of the federal funds we've removed tons of administrators we've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made\nTeenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at it at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids ... now thinking about this dilemma twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo build their kid isn't there the bully cage and something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's the bully but not he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade discipline problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they taught\nWas killing children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that's killing our kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go shoot my fellow friend the teachers have mean you know build a rocket with my class I Can't go to the ... the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose\nI don't know about you but I'm tired of the same old politics and uh Larry sharp is joining us now he is running for\nGovernor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a he needs to be introduced to a larger audience how ... what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtained ground you might see in the long time um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect\nOf the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a van ... ethics are calendar or making sure people show up social media we have a a team on Twitter team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's YouTube we do video production\nWhen you have not and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf fans of millions of dollars absolutely we raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition\nAnd with that I pulled that Thirteen percent so you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through times Thirteen or ... percent this is a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part right the math equation cannot get two hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out\nTo enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets to be over thirty per se I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes ... yeah yeah it's really is as well get again remember at as third party in general the system is that against you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine\nMentality could do this because every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill\nRadios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter I get I I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even do thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS they got him ... his name he decided nope lottery shop dozens of beyond their he decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle we have to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard then you should probably\nUh maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that was ... so this is a radio debate yes well that can be televised also now okay we both televised on radio ... he'll be buff okay so yeah again and they're just deciding no\nWe don't want no dummy wrong there are three other people should be made should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there\nBut this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part\nWith all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that's that's that but they don't they don't they don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing\nLarry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the mass among mass forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law so if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand it's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that coming up in a just a second a standby\nOn TV Tonight is tonight Michael reckon ...\nTonight Michael ... from uh New York university a fascinating guy if you haven't met him yet\nYou will tonight and it will be a something you don't forget the guy who used to write white papers for the Communist Party who now says wait a minute and democratic socialist near the hell out of me Mm\nDon't miss a lecture or see on ... radio\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nFind that come in with Larry sharp I'm doing a story on candidate a for a for New York or she\nIs libertarian and uh is making waves in New York and he's a voice that you should hear because his\nHis policies are different than the Republican and the Democrats and I believe they're very very workable in a in an era when we are changing everything when technology has changed everything\nWhy we're still looking at a system ah you know that feels like the old Soviet size styles centralized system is beyond me but\nI'm Larry let me let me just run down a couple of things um you are if you were governor of the state of New York you are dealing with the big banks ... uh and the big banks a Cuomo is\nPushing them around quite a bit especially when it comes to the second amendment a and trying to deep platform ah people if you do any business with with gun manufacturers or gun dealers\nTotally on ethical for a governor to impede business\nPeriod no ifs ands or buts if I don't like in the industry or like something I never said if I Want to have freedom of speech but when it comes to being governor I should have the opposite I should be the facilitator and chief\nI should be the marketer and chief not not his majesty emperor who decides these people are evil because I deem it so that's the wrong answer that's what he's doing the reality of it is he's he's not only\nDoing that he's also threatening another group of business people that you'll be in trouble with the state if you do business with these\nYes absolutely and and what winds up happening more than ... more than more than often as normal thing which is the small guy gets hurt here because big business will always find a way around his edicts right they always they find a way around it but how about the guy who say for example just wants to insurance force firearm now we can't get it\nThere's no way that the individual and there are at least four million I'm gun owners in New York state if not more\nWell how do they mean insurance now\nWhen when when insurance companies won't do business in New York state anymore\nFor for any kind of firearm but that's the plan isn't it that's the problem yet and that's the unethical part that's the issue right and this is you're making New York state residents criminals overnight not just that if it's a gun violation in New York state it's by default a violent felony by default no matter what you do\nThat's how it works in New York state you're turning millions of New Yorkers into violent felons overnight and we wonder why we have a ... if you have a gun if you if you have a firearm that is not safe act compliant\nSay fact was passing twenty Thirteen and if a fact said that certain aspects\nOf a firearm make it legal or illegal ... literally ... what he decided\nI think this piece of plastic is evil so this piece of plastic which is now he but which by the way you purchase the day before a complete legally totally above board you are now a violent felon it was so bad that the cops said wait a minute now we're all violent felons to\nNot joking district story they had an out revamp the law because all the cops were felons overnight yes all the ... revamped of all because of that in other words but it now if you're retired cop once you retire well now you're a felon again\nBecause you know going back to the cop\nThis and this is where we are in New York state this is horribly bad the the the answer isn't always the same thing it is all about projecting how he is helping the little guy constantly project I care about the little guy but every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over ... million since he's descended thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million look they're voting with their feet\nWhen it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see it here in Texas with your place for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and we have all the time you're\nIn New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so ... is a critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "22"}
