interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up\nOr his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nJust saw an article today about from ...

C. K. [noise] uh there's this\nThere's an interesting thing from the New York times today and it is they do this little pod cast in the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy\nCase should be allowed back on stage ever ever um he did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes\nAt odd part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him and doing something that against his will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure in himself while on the phone with her because I guess he was breathing heavy or something\nAnd ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics power dynamic absolutely yeah the power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian\nHe's in ... he wields incredible power right in this country now incredibly let ... fired at any job in the nation any job you're\nA sarcasm is just reality in the situation that they're kind of like well why is that what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them people were other comedians\nAnd one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\nWas this was his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force her to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation last alert to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously ...\nYeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry\nSay that is is that sexual assault the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that ... it's unbelievable there was you know so ... he admitted to being a dirt bag right man he admitted in such a general way that\nPeople kind of uh making eat he well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat what I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's evidence\nThat he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again he's making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scares away from right you're not supposed to just a CEO and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar as famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks into doesn't set or Jerry Seinfeld comes in a while 'cause that are loose the gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's bounced around just several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times of the exhaustive report about tried to talk to the club owner but why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen\nAll the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work yeah he's like never ... might never say never\nWell could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never misses an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the harvest place what you would say particularly to a female customer who is somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nAnd to keep up with

just\nThey're so kind and loving accepting intolerant that's the beauty of tolerant of that word by the way I it's not a thing anymore you don't tolerate anything yeah more\nWhat are you lie about the idea is that we're all other because other people around and we're like well I think he ... he ... did blackout how the hell do you know not only he would know that right ah you know maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that ah\nThere's no way to know that ain't too there's conversation but still there's no way to know what it's a ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the subtle\nAccusation that everyone who supported Brett Kavanaugh was a terrible person\nEven from people like you know there are people on the left that you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar to almost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is they accuse us\nOf believing forward\nIn a roundabout sort of way they are accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want him on the Supreme Court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either and they haven't been I think it happened with somebody else maybe believing that is is this is a\nI don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party like\nWhat are we in the person who's making the accusation\nHas an overt uh dislike for the\nParty of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist his march women's march rallies as as an obvious Democrat like\nYou have to take in that motivation forty years later into account\nI always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost it's like it's got some bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you do I leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor that indicates that this misadventures occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicate that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but then I wouldn't they Levi\n... survived this assault by this man maybe if they've assault didn't happened they didn't survive it and [laughter] you know I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so far life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible what you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm\nPossibly could lose your motivation [laughter]\nWhether they should like this I don't know when I taught at school we\nTalk about uh yeah I Know we talk about\nThe the women's right to choose it is just ended and if it is the life of a baby not the ending of one\nI wouldn't defend my children's lives about as strongly as they would they defend their right to kill their children hit is the most important thing in the universe to how many millions of Americans\nThe idea that you wouldn't do something to take out a guy who you think is going to overturn that right that you think is so vital\nIs insane we've seen them far crazier things happen we saw an accusation last week and we're five five accusers accused the high school student of sexual assault because they as they later admitted like him didn't\nLike him yeah we have we have a hoax allegations that have come through all the time people paint swastikas on their own garage they write I don't like your lifestyle and receipts because they're trying to blame people for being against being anti gay\nThis happens all the time you know why people are horrible\nMany of them are awful their women are awful men are awful they do terrible things that you can explain it happens all the time and the idea that they wouldn't do that with this on the line people are writing the swastikas\nOn their door for nothing you know to like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot one of the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact\nThe fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them we know the ...\nThe fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or what had happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusations we're littered all over the store\nThe only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first to and and in the second one is is that there's a ... their right they wouldn't be the person who made the allegation said I was\nBy someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them All right well I I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media did locate the person and that person said\nWhat are you going to do with an ... I mean if you shot somebody in the eyes yeah you're supposed to work out those right when you're wearing yeah that would hurt ha ha ha you might put an eye out my mom warns me more than me about\nThat a word that was a kid um but other than that I I don't know what you're going to do with yourself gun that's so dangerous that they had their arrest the kid when they found out it's an ... gun\nBut he wasn't even walking down the street he posted a photo you didn't on right now buddy\nDidn't didn't say I'm going to use this school none of that\nVery bizarre [noise]\nHouston sounds good everywhere legs are flaky pie or see on ... radio\nSta weekly report you'll get expert inciting analysis in the financial markets delivered right to your inbox is an expensive to sign up it's a hundred percent free sounds like it should be illegal hits one hundred percent legal and easy as pie from your friends with the S.
