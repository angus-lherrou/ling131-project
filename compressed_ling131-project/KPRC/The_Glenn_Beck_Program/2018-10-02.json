in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind and you know what I I I really I\nCan understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nBut she is possessed

yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yep no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that you cannot know that\nI mean this is

a ton a ton in there\nI I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this happened I think yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to

just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the entire effort of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism huh it's explained in the book and you'll see a lot of times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things just doesn't make any sense and there's easy political explanations for all of it but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean and it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories and the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you would find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way a and\nThe reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh end of the the upper echelons of\nPolitics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe what they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal in their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy in the patriarchy and to collapse the system that we have\nYeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life ... you see them acting a radically and there's some reason and you don't understand is why would they do this they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it yeah it is not a uh it's\nAbout a book about surrender it as a book about stand and fight just fight the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on

us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know she gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you for having us up at the area important it's so important is very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold a role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense

certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nA by a woman or he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the cabinet case in the aisles the case\nOf the cabinet case happens or thirty six years ago by the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference ...\nA professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even than that there was a relationship of any sort of between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay I got both of those so little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay and so he does what did she\n... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it\nWrong of course well yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which she referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries ah um and that kind of a difference to you might you might know slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you\nKnow using meeting me yeah and she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising on her the other one of course does not\nBeing forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening then people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them said I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborate is your story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people\nSay the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um pictures\nAnd they are those are things that she showed two co workers in real\nTired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that Ford told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like having a I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but but but lives and I mean you\nI mean you don't have video tape tape now we haven't seen it yet though ha ha now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the ...\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a a ton of evidence\nAnd in fact I don't know\nHundreds of times more
