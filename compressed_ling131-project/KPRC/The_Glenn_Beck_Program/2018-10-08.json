I see people sitting around playing these stupid and I thought they were a lame and the ... the Milwaukee bad graphic video games oh there but I guess 'cause people play them this younger generation played them when they were kids\nAnd so now send the ... thing to play these blocking weird moving\nVideo I actually I didn't care for them that much when I was kid they thought they were out men men like a well well you know it is what it is in society likes what they like and they do what they do and\nYou know they they're they're biased detectors or have always working uh you know even\nEven when they listen to their their favorite\nCommentator they're still kind of you know it's you see the human hand\nYou know and everyone knows humans are ... are headed out when people are you\nYeah of course but when people are using it turns out my research shows other research shows when people are using something like a Google Search engine\nThey turn off the biased detectors they automatically become very trusting 'cause I think this is an algorithm not that they know what an algorithm is but this is an algorithm and I can trust a subjective an impartial so that when Google Answers your question about anything\nAh what what tends to happen is if people trust what higher up in the list they think that the algorithm has very carefully and objectively selected and it must be true so if you favor one candidate\nOne cause or one company or whatever it may be one product in search results\nUh people tend to believe whatsoever closest to the top and and what I showed in in a series of randomized controlled experiments of it and that we've now done with for national elections involving no\nMore than ten thousand people [noise] uh I've shown over and over and over and over again that by favoring one candidate you can shift in a country like ours millions of votes with no one having this latest idea\nThat they are being manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track\nYou do that is scary\nIt is you you um you leave this out in the in the creepy line I'm about how\nGoogle has really stripped itself of all ads and everything else so it it looks totally clean and neutral and without an agenda\n[noise] um and then uh how they have ... you know\nThe ... when you first did it I think one of the tests you did you did it where\nYou were you were clear with an agenda then you added one that might go in the other direction and then you added to search results of that would go in the other direction and you got it to a point to where Google is to where you don't have any idea you're being manipulated\nCorrectly you have absolutely no idea of someone we we did this in a national study in the last almost no one was aware\nThat they were seeing biased or a search result search for those that favor one candidate that this really creepy saying there was that the very very few people who could spot the bias they shifted even farther in the direction of the bias\nSo you know being able to spot the bias does not protect you uh we did a a big national study in India right in the middle of their election there are two thousand fourteen\nNinety nine point five percent of people in the study or could see no bias whatsoever they couldn't see the favoritism uh and and and yet we're still getting these big chefs\nAre in their voting preferences so you know this is this is unprecedented in human history this is this is just this is an ability to shift people's thinking and behavior\nWorldwide it's not just in the U. S. because Google is is you know use a ... you know Ninety percent of all searches conducted throughout the world\nUh you know and and and that was they have the ability to shift people's thinking behavior votes purchases attitudes beliefs or around the world they are doing so twenty four seven with out people knowing and without leaving a paper\nTrail because when you're showing something someone search results have felt like a news story than just stays there for people to look at it generated just for you on the fly at that moment disappears gone forever stored now where\nWould you is it an overstatement\nTo say whether it's uh\nUm you know Wilson and Bernays a in World War one or or uh you know ... ... World War two that this is the\nThis is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda [noise]\n[noise] oh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article a called a can ways big tech\nCan shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem FEMA\nThat's just one of ten ways ah that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before\nUh and they they they are I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they were ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen or working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what people are seeing while they were using a that Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system as it was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton who am I favored by the way as you mentioned\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty blatant that's pretty extreme wow there's these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nUh that we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners and academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nAble to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think\nBe able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know our issue we well I Wish we could be fully up and running and time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which Glenn\nIn trouble [laughter] what\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm ... [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good in the good the good\nNews I mean the the good news is that um that Glenn Beck dot com right\nYeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you're not\nSharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now\nInteresting left in New York Times\nThe times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on base share all of their\nEmails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing you know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google\nAnd I wrote a piece about that and it was in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for ... [laughter] this is asking that for a second it will come back with the bad news ...\nThe the ... I think he's in ten different ways that Google is influencing us and not just Google but these big tech companies and\nSome of the other things that uh he has found how they are monitoring our children and it is remarkable and we are running out of time in the before Google is the dominant than just can\nBe stopped in our sponsor this half hour is gold line President Trump has been warning about the risk to every American if the Republicans lose one or both houses of Congress was November and the risks are\nPretty uh pretty dire uh and especially coupled with what the Democrats were saying this weekend there are several stories out this weekend say that they have to become more radical uh ... in their their push back\nI don't know how you become more radical than they already have been\nAnd ... making that up my I think they just make it up\n[laughter] no no no no no no everyone said I'm Stein no one\nSays ... okay [laughter] so [laughter] [noise] excuse me uh so you were just about to give me more good news [noise] [noise]\nWell the other good news is again you you you do not share your emails with Google a lot of major news organizations like the New York times and the Boston Globe they do but it's bad news is\nThat a Glenn Beck dot com uses Google Google Analytics and so what that means ... everyone who has ever visited your website is tracked every single thing they do on your website is tracked by Google\n\nSo here's a here's the problem is a business owner Google Analytics or the best\nNow do you how do you how do you do business without Google at times that's that's always the thing that gets you in\nThe yeah well sure but you know ... you know this is this convenience thing over and over and and their products are so good so but you don't realize that these aren't real products they're just surveillance platforms that's the only reason they run them every single service they provide as just another surveillance platform\n[laughter] uh I Do have a little bit more good news though which is that film that you mentioned the creepy lie has\nA when ... when you had a my ... one of my new very good friends Peter Schweitzer on your your show recently a is a uh he's the one who would who really got that film running\nA it sure wasn't available but now as of right now it is available both on Amazon and on I tense for for rental or a sale and it and it really is a fabulous film\nAnd builds Google it just go to the freebie lying dot com when you came out about some of this stuff and again you were a Hillary supporter when you came out about this ... were you you were blocked by Google for a time where you are not\nWell when I when my research a first hit the news and the Washington Post a you know I found that starting the next day I couldn't access any Google products I couldn't even access to Google dot com so [laughter] I have\nThese amazing screen shots that they're just shocking to people because you can't even imagine not being able to access Google yeah but I have to screen shot showing getting these time out saying no you know you can't get their sorry\nAmazing okay um ... let's go through some of the uh ... some of the uh affects that you are monitoring we have about about a minute here so why don't you just take one of them on you say there was the last\nSeven ten or ten of these that you're\nFollowing ten altogether okay\nOut an altogether okay so let's take on one real quick\nBegin very good when ... okay here we go this is called the er the search\nSuggestion effect and when you start to type a search term into the Google Search bar you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type so if you type a depending on your history and other things chances are you'll get Amazon\nRight away they'll start slashing suggestions at you\nAnd Amazon and it turns out is Google's biggest advertiser paying them three hundred million dollars a year and Google sends more traffic to Amazon than any other single source but beyond that we've learned through our experiments that Google can use search suggestions that their flashing asked you\nTo turn a fifty fifty vote among\nA fifty fifty split among undecided voters into in Ninety\nTen split will buy one having any idea they're being manipulated\nOh my gosh oh my gosh okay we're going to come back and uh and go through the others if we have time\nHe'll talk about some of the other things Google is doing and what we're supposed to do about it you need to know about it you can see it in the ... the line\nIt's a new documentary the freebie line dot com the freebie line dot com\nDon't lose the election of ... on all the hard review\n\nThe climate probably Dr Robert ... he's a senior research psychologist American Institute for behavioral research in technology\nHe is I'm In a new documentary called the creepy line we talked about it last week I saw it last week\nAnd it is indeed very creepy it is\nUm it's it's\nIs it too much to say it's\nMore on the we're apt mind control or the threshold of mind control doctor\n[noise] [noise] uh well we've been there for a long time so there's a you know ah there's no question about it there's they're literally right now more than\nTwo point five billion people soon to be over four billion a whose whose thoughts and purchases and beliefs and attitudes and voting preferences are are affected are dramatically uh every single day\nBy a some manipulations that big tech companies are perpetrating on them and that's happening now so that that's already going full steam or it's just getting worse every day\nSo I I just I I Want to reset that\nYou did a\nA study during the last presidential election you are a Hillary Clinton supporter but you're a truth teller and you were\nDoing a a a a\nStudy on Google Search results and found that they were trying to manipulate it in favor of Hillary Clinton now you say that's the only one way we then have the search suggestion effect now target messaging affect\nWhat is the targeting\nCharts the shura targeted messaging T Emmy we call that is a these are all things that we study and that where you were you know were quantifying and you know very precisely a targeted messing effect is really scary ah\nThis this means that if a company that's primarily be Facebook but other companies to but if a company like Facebook on election day so let's go back to November two thousand sixteen is is that morning mark sucker Berg\nHad chosen to just you know hit the anarchy and send out\nGo out and vote reminders uh mainly just supporters of Hillary Clinton\nOr exclusively either way first of all no one would know that that wasn't even occurring no one would know it was going to some people and not others\nBut if it went justice supporters of Hillary Clinton that would have given her that day an additional\nFour hundred and fifty thousand votes now gosh I I don't I I don't think he did that because you know he was very overconfident a you know as as we're Democrats or I'm not a Democrat I'm not\nI'm I'm a ... a moderate in and independent but at the point is everyone thought Hillary was going to win so I'm pretty sure he didn't do that uh but the point is we know from Facebook's own published data\nThat that just sending out that kind of reminders selectively\nDramatically dramatically shifts votes and think about it no one knows if if something like that is happening in fact if it's happening every single day there there were targeted messages going out to some people but not others and of course isn't that what targeted advertising is all about\nBut you see targeted advertising though it's competitive but I'm Talking about what happens if the platform itself does something that's not competitive as completely invisible and it's not competitive so\nCan I mean this is so dangerous um\nAnd it is I mean it's everything that aside by you know a writer has envision forever\nUh and I mean can can\nEspecially when we get two artificial intelligence couldn't a system like Google be used to identify unstable individuals and wind them up\n[noise] Oh yes they can they in fact they know who's an unstable they know who's undecided they know who is Republican and who is gay and you name it they know far more about it\nI mean ... I mean on the table mentally\nYeah yeah yeah oh no you're absolutely right they have literally unprecedented power or\nTo ... ...\nIs shifts to people yes shift unstable people's shift anybody uh and and they know they have this power uh one of the leaks from Google was a a a ... a little internal film their\nEight minute film called the selfish ledger you want to get creamed out [laughter] botched that film that's an internal film there were there they're talking about their power to reshape human kind\nI it's hard to tell I ... I'm going to have to say probably not because it's it's very very hard uh you know Google and Facebook meticulous are are are so powerful and so imbedded\nDay you just ... ... you can't really cut into them people people don't want to leave them people or you know they they love them\nAnd so it's hard you know I Know lots of people working on alternative kinds of you know services and\nA and a lot of people are talking about block chain and so on but I mean the reality is you know we're talking about Ninety percent of search around the world is done on Google\nUh these two companies are serving right now more than two point five billion people that'll be pass four billion within the next three years they're just growing and growing\nGrowing by leaps and bounds so it's ... hurting what they're doing in China I mean I mean I don't know how I don't know how they sleep at night\n[noise] [noise] well that's outrageous that is ... so they because they're actually they're actually partnering with the Chinese government to participate in the Chinese governments\nAre aggressive a program to control all of its citizens and Google is ... ... and that I mean literally making it easier and better\nMaking that kind of system easier and better that's ... that's that's outrageous\nDoctor I Would I Would love to fly you in and spend a couple of hours with you and and have you on regularly to to be able to monitor and help in any way that we can to get the word out this is\nThis is the thing that I think America and the world should be concentrating on and no one's talking about it the world is being redesigned\nBy a handful and we're just not aware of it and it's going to change overnight a doctor thank you so much\nI really appreciate it absolutely you bet it's been an honor true out or Glenn\nThank you very much Dr Robert ... [noise] ah the documentary you have to see is the creepy line go there now the creepy line dot com truly truly remarkable group with a trailer and watched it on YouTube or ... or don't just go

ten proposition just by suggestion by Google I mean that is and if you think\nThey're not doing well he's already proven that they are did they did it last time we are talking about the we're talking

an aspirin nothing was real effect really\nIt is remarkable it is a pain relief one hundred percent natural and it reduces inflammation which is the leading cause of a of paying 'em ... please check this out you take it three times a day a hundred percent after all and it works\nNever mind that no Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached or that not even progressive superhero FDR was able to pack the court\nProgressive specialize in moving goalpost when they don't like the game the left says they need to get tougher\nThey need to get quote more radical and quote\n\nThat is exactly why America needs a conservative constitutional majority on the Supreme Court because the laughter uses every apparatus of government to create their vision of society outside of the constitution\nToo often these days the Supreme Court is the last line of defense against progressive overreach\n\nIn my early ... programs\nHave feelings too [noise] after that last hour really really really well really good [noise]\nYou know this is something that I've been talking about for years I mean since since we you know we're working together just the two of us in the nineties and I said some day it's going to be that you won't believe your eyes because they'll be able to create a video of anybody doing anything and you won't be able to believe your eyes\nWhile we're there\nI've been talking about the coming of AI why did last hour\nWhy did that affect you so much um\nCouple of things uh one I think like we all there's a lot of people who claim that\nThat these big tech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do um you know and it but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true and a lot of cases [noise] um you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter\nWould do a test of the two thousands sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is a ... you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks\nThey've known in all this is like a lot of a leader in in in psychology yeah it's I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy is the real deal with\nSome real credibility again comes the sun is that hard on the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate as he described it so you know Hillary as voter right right um\nBut beyond that uh ... seems incredibly helpless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how do we persuade people to look at the world and ex slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talked about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily 'cause I just do it right it's but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to own my wind myself from Google\nI honestly have no idea how I Would do that and I'm and\nI'm not even use an Android app me so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance apparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know in one of the reasons they do is it's the best what right like this is a problem because the ... part of the reason why it's the best one\nIt's because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right um you know ah the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used it's it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know as you get into deep south in ... but I don't even know how just why myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers a use other uh you know all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go deaf duck goes a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but\nI was like you know maybe I should start using that and I went to ... go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser I think what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on grown so now I've got ... I gotta switch emails I gotta switch phones I gotta switch browsers I like my whole life is turned upside down and I can't\nI Can't come up with enough personal cost to what Google is doing right now to justify a life altering move like that what did he say\nThree hundred million word\nYet documentary million ... is like a ... of of\nData on you\nAnd that ... million pages and pages of data\nAnd again like but I I don't know what it's a personal cost to me in that data\nWell there's several things there are some things you could turn into I think there are several things that could turn into that are really negative for society he talked about how you could take a fifty fifty proposition\nAnd just by Google suggesting one way or the other can move people to Ninety ten Ninety percent goes away the Google wants them to go that evidence that's incredible it's a great argument to have real principals right make sure you actually know what you're a ... or what your feelings are on an issue before\nYou are you are influenced like this because we can see how voters do that but I mean the other part of that too is you go to a place with no cookies and no none of these things tracking you will they don't know your preferences and they don't know the things that you like and there are negatives to that\nIt is a real struggle I don't even know how it would do it if I Want it to the problem is not\nToday this is not today it's just\nTechnology is now starting to a compound upon itself exponential growth\nIn ways that we will not be able to understand I mean as the book I write about this in addicted outrage and you know use it you said when you read the\nUh chapters on a technology I remember you came in and wet okay well that's a little bleak oh yeah but I mean a sale in their right right it's it's\nIt I mean it ... you just heard that from a guy who's been studying Google for ten years\nAnd he's a he's a Clinton supporter ... is he saying anything less than I Am saying\nNo I mean I think if anything it backs that up yeah and that's that was terrifying because we can all look at the potential future of some sort of series of events that could go negatively and you know you've talked about that you've talked we've discussed openly sometimes you think as a catastrophe ... right like you think of the worst case scenarios\nBut these are measured results these aren't worst case scenarios the fact that the top ten Google risk a road search results are returning things favorable to Hillary Clinton\nIs not some wild crazy theory it's something that's already happened in his over where are they now what are they doing with this now and imagine if they get over more overt we talk about you know Trump pushes a lot of buttons of people you saw how they acted with Kavanaugh\nRight you saw how the left really accurate ... acted crazily towards the Supreme Court justice when they feel so justified\nIn the way they act they get crazier and crazier and crazier and as this stuff escalates they're going to feel justified to take more overt action and got only knows where that ends up I I ...
