pronounce the easy word yeah it was going to be together as a more than one filled with a lot of there's a lot of confidence there I don't know how you doing there and I'm doing well how are you\nGood I'm I'm a I'm I'm really fascinated by how we make the turns in our society for the future and a ownership is a big part of this because in the future I don't know how many people leaving on cars I mean it's just it's just all changing\nBut do we really own things when we buy them online\nSo I think there's a real concern here that consumers go into transactions when they're buying things and digital goods are especially digital books movies music they go into this transaction assume when they were the same way they do in the in the world of tangible goods\nWhere if you buy a book you can give it away to a friend you can lend it to someone you can leave it in your will or in the future and leave your book collection a two or your loved ones\nAnd the rules that control these digital transactions when you buy something on your Kindle or my shows are very different from the rules that we expect in the physical world\nAnd consumers don't really understand that distinction and I think that causes a disconnect between what we all expect to happen and what happens in fact so to give you a a quick example I'm just a\nCouple of weeks ago I'm a consumer uh a customer of the apple I choose a movie store\nFound that three movies purchased had ... had been deleted from his account there were no longer accessible and I think that shocked a lot of people\nUm those of us have been following these issues closely for years would remember ten years ago when the Amazon remotely deleted\nBooks off of people's candles yams including\nA ironically George Orwell Nineteen eighty four [laughter] 'cause these these issues have been happening for a long time but I think people are are are now starting to read a sit up and take notice\nOkay so I I remember it gives us that it's easier for me to read everything on Kendall um but I and I have a a large collection uh in my library of of of hardcover books\nAh and I read so much I read it all on tinder but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because you watch things like that happening in China if you're ... if you're in China and the first they wouldn't sell the\nBook but if they did sell the book the government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that every copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern or from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these\nBooks are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets then there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um the these works\nIn an air and it was a movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are a number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh so they almost force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored\nBut you still had the old copy\nNow threat you can't ... I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison\nYou can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war huh well I Want to see what it was like when they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device um and and this is a practical tips for people you should\nIs try to store as much as you can do the locally but at least services are often trying to encourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example\nThe Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference a year relationship as\nIf I downloaded a something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\nOr so is it allows you to store those files locally on your own device but because the Kendal is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as a show ten years ago to block it moves those files strong\nMuslim ... ... you're talking about oh go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago chewing it a different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way they've forced everybody to have it\nExactly\nIt's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\n... it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break\nAnd then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the change in\nHim capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor ... years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year um oh ...

online\nSometimes you're not actually buying them you're just renting them you're entering an ongoing relationship\nWhat does this mean for um society how is this going to change us we'll it

author of the book what we buy when we buy now and you can find more information at the end of ownership dot com era and so tell me what how you've been looking at this\nSo I think in the short term we're likely to see more changes in the way our commercial interactions occur and the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured\nWe're we're going to start to see people become more and more accustomed to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways I I think that makes some degree of sense there are some people for whom owning a car is it necessary they'd rather be able to take a left or use some sort of car share application\nAnd I think that makes a lot of sense what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from independent control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies that control access\nSo ... maybe may I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to and we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I um I Do I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up in the motor vehicle context or the ... the way it come up um uh most most recently in most often is actually not with cars but with tractors or John Deere\nUm the law are running American farm equipment company makes exactly this argument that they own the software and the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop or you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us do we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who take something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost create this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be it just runs that way and it stops innovation doesn't it\nI I think it has the real risk of doing that it it discourages people from being creative that discourages people from um from as he said ... with the same as if they are and we have a lot of ah incredible innovations

to play either side I'm not gonna I'm not going to jump in or off this cliff with the rest of humanity\nI Do not believe the victim I Will take seriously the account of the accuser\nThen I Will look at the facts if there is a preponderance of evidence then I Will presume that person either innocent or guilty but after I've seen facts\nIf this kind of stuff was going on this should all be in the court of law\nIf you are a victim\nSociety will do nothing for you because we cannot do anything for you if you haven't gone to the police and reported it\nIf you believe that we live in a rape culture then you have a responsibility to go to the police and document everything that has been done\nThen we as a society need to do everything we can to make sure that justice is served not on a collective basis but judging it by the individual case\nThat is a just society that is America\n[noise]\nCan uncover here and you're listening to that going back program [noise] one\nOf my favorite guys or because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that here at Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and ah and I think it's his background as an engineer or ... or and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us into directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's kick can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the Kavanaugh case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming ah understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were us suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming\nIt's kind of program you know like good man I met my friend that's ... that's right that's right and screw up anyway the great thing is if you need coverage if
