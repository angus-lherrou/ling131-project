Bhutto here's your Obama phone here's your ah\nYour free schools and we'll ... we'll spend billions of dollars to hire teachers 'cause you're not going to learn to bother to speak our language you're not going away by ... and you said most of your money home to your relatives so that\nA it was started by what's his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name is do no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one\nSo Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose the fight back trumped it and he said I'm not gonna let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter they\nSee me as a person who strikes back when attacked so while I'm going to do that\nSo then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this and you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow how how he's he's assuming people names yeah\nHe's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no is it to them on your ... feeling beaten and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent than Trump was a player and could win\nSee what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could do anything you want to have a chance he was he was like\nEntertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear that's how the press on him but then when he started to win the whole strategy changed\nAnd it I I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does\nOkay so then it was destroy him\nDestroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it so he does it in\nA very ... and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice what if he doesn't do it they are\nGoing to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah in the liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him and the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights\nBack but now they're turning it around saying well your your fight back cabinet\nKavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if that fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion it's the same thing\nSo now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it or not us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or\nAre they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us from the jump of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight straight this word but mayor yes was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they're crazy could be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really\nUnbelievably worse the bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press were going to send these to all of the all of the enemies of the right or we'll obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence with midterms I'm putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow do you do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motives\nOr it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story wouldn't it or why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly\n... how would the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the Washington DC think tanks progression think tanks and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff\nSo that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this um may be the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never say well gee maybe um our side\nIs so craves now that we have to criticize our side you're never going to see that\nEver [noise] back with Bill O'Reilly and the rest of the news of the week in just a second [noise]\nSo [noise] does this change the election what's going on [noise]\nI Will tell you if the [noise]\nIf a house in the Senate or lost uh we're in for an amazing wild ride a especially economically I think we are already in for a wild ride and one of the reasons I'm becoming more and more concerned\nAbout the trade war um but imagine imagine if the house in the Senate or just the house are controlled or what is the president going to be able to do uh on the economy what does the president going to be able to do without a Congress or when it comes to just the skirmish on the\nBorder you imagine if you imagine what that is going to be like\nGold line has just put a report together a on what you can expect if there is a democratic victory you can get this report for free just by calling them I don't know if you've been paying attention to the stock market um but you know instead of this ah this this bombing things from somebody who is clearly\nEither incompetent unstable or just wants attention\nBut we should be paying attention to what's happening in the stock market what's happening with the economy read this report I've read it I've already shared it\nYou need to get it to its free all you have to do is call gold line right now and ask them for their election report a doorway called them now eight six six gold line one eight six six gold line or gold line dot com [noise]\nSome smart and your smart speaker to play it could be ... on my heart radio [noise]\nEvery day it seems like we turn on the news and you have absolutely no idea what's going to go on its war in Syria another mass shooting a terrorist attack another indictment and the Mueller investigation a mudslide earthquake an inexplicable drop in the stock market it's crazy that's why you need to prepare\nNot because you're paranoid or pessimistic because

that's the debate I mean I just crush them in the bay 'cause he would have no answer\nFor any of that bill\nTell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people\nUm because that was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about Soros after CBS glorified and\nWe said no I'm the he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean they attack and smear anyone they disagree with David Brock runs one of them\nThat's the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a benevolent mad so I Believe that these\nKinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and Honduras but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money behind as everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of ... saying\nI'm this is this is backed by a Cuba or Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest ah the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this or they'll have to accept our citizens this is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this mess\nThis is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government found what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now\nHe Venezuela in Cuba are together in what was formerly known is all about but they are tested the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now ... others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipe line of cash going into your kid to goose ... so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth of George Soros or people like him did this but if\nYou know it's it's one of his these things they've done in the past yes but the\nThe government of Honduras should be able to trace ... foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here so I Hope they do that\nIf they if they believed Cuban Venezuela actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and then by extension hurting the usa they have the ability to find that out\nThere or to let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one\nAnd I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like\nIf they do arrive at the border are and how the press is going to treat this and what do sane Americans do to counter that when we come back with Bill O'Riley [noise]\nHouston sounds good everywhere legs on ... on a review\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou have to climb down from Bill O'Reilly bill let me lay out a scenario here and you tell me where it's where I'm\nI'm off days I don't think of this caravan helps the Democrats in the mid term elections and it's why\nThe press is saying oh there's no there's no evidence that they're going to come all the way to the border and they're dismissing it and that's just a crazy conspiracies the things they get all the Trump supporters all wound up\nThere all dismissing this now um I I Can't believe that they're going to make it by the mid term election I think this is the to the to arrive\nAfter the mid term election a and a possible new Democratic House which will throw us into chaos hey you think there's any reality in their\n... be what do you see coming in and how things are going to shake out\n[noise] I said on Bill O'Reilly dot com I now she says that the Mexican government will break up\nA lot of the uh the caravan before\nThey start getting on to vehicles 'cause they're not going to walk to Macau in Texas or tea wanna\nUm San Diego sector I they're not gonna do it so they're at a they're approaching a railway term is now in Mexico some of them will get on trains heading north Austrians have to stop and Mexico City and that's where I Believe the Mexican government to start to intervene\nUm some of them will make it I'm\n... now and they're not going to walk\nSo you don't think it'll be a mass\nNada break 'em up that's what you know look the state department palm pay I was down there now army needs screaming at them now that you know if you let these people en masse go to the border we're gonna take economic reprisals on Mexico and that's what they'll do it and they know it so they'll break it up\nBut some people will reach and some people would get they're mostly in vehicles um that's where the smugglers command the cartels come in a a a\n... to hit us already has vehicles down there um you can do trains you can do a whole bunch of stuff but\nWhen it gets to that point\nThey um border authorities will put up barriers new barriers and there'll be manned by us troops and there'll be no way for the migrants to get to any us official\nTo apply for asylum jobs already said he's going to do that he has to do it on the left is hoping for some kind of violent confrontation that's what they would like to see\n'em but I agree with you that this is not helping the Democratic party I'm In the vote ten days from now how bad it's hurting them it depends what section of the country you rent\nOr do you uh um do you see\nThe the possibility that real\n... would like to set up a a Palestinian\nUh Israel situation at our border and they would be handled exactly the same way by the media as they handle the Palestinians and Israel they\nThey show the big bad state beating up on the on the little guy do you I mean I I said two years ago this is what our border is eventually going to look like they're going to set up a\nA Palestinian state in kind of situation and we're going to be Israel I mean they've already done this you know one of the small stage bring it you know bring it to Broadway bring\nIt to the American border and that's the way they'll play it\nMay be but there's all the ... the Mexican government does not want that or they don't they they don't want they got problems on the border um ... you know war is one of the worst places in the world Tijuana right behind\nThey don't want all this because it drains their infrastructure I mean this is an environmental disaster from Mexico these people only facilities are they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah\nSo how do they would love shantytowns there with ... mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and let them in shore but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nYep thank you very much Bill O'Reilly\nThen

was a treated or in the wounded man and needed to carry one of the soldiers off to another Humvee to be met it backed out one of the soldiers had his arm severed just below the elbow and was in shock\nHe handed the soldiers his own arm after applying a tourniquet and told the soldier he needed to follow him as he got another soldier out that wasn't able to walk the man looked at his own sever an army and his hand and repeatedly told\nThe medic that that helped him that his arm was fine and this was in his arm sometimes we just don't know how to deal with things\nFor two solid week site lie to myself and my daughter was fine and this didn't happen didn't happen to her it didn't happen to us and I broke down in tears finally able to process what had the fall and my now seven year old daughter\nMy wife forgave me for spending those two weeks\nIt wasn't until months after\nThat we would figure out who had done this terrible thing all they want it to do after she told me about this was find is that the sky and cut off the offending appendages\n\nAs it turned out it was a twelve year old boy he was in my Sunday school class for ten months\n\nI had been teaching this boy in Sunday school\n\n\nOh how I hated and wanted to hate this young man I wanted to ruined his life before it even began\n\nI wanted to let you know that in the height of my hatred I downloaded your book addicted to outrage on audible\n\nWho's the last couple of chapters that I heard you speak\nThat I I realize that my outrage was justified but it was also toxic and it would become a force to be used to destroy me\nI needed to forgive this boy because we are required to forgive all men\nI forgave him in my heart\nAnd as I did I felt the burden of my outrage and my anger lifted\n\nYes the pain of what happened still lingers and the reality of the situation is still very real but my outlook in my spirit or no longer held hostage by my hate\n\nI just wanted to thank you for writing this book it literally helped me pick myself out of darkness so deep that I thought there was no way out\n\nI wanted to let you know that your work has helped save at least one guy\nChristian\n\n\nChristian as a

of the man who um did this to my son\n\nAnd I think if it would have happened and I wasn't home my wife may have killed him\n\n\n\nI think about it all the time to think about my children\nAll the time and\n\n\nYour email has reminded me\n\nThat it's not just me or I haven't talked to my wife about it\n\nFor the last few months and I know how much it still bothers me\nHow we're responsible I have been to not realize she is probably dealing with it as well\n\nThere are things that we don't want to think about\nThat are truly frightening\nAnd I think\nWhen we look at our country when we look and we really realize\n\nWhy do we really stand to lose it's not our job is not our money it's the unsinkable\n\nIt's something that doesn't happen to us that happens to other countries but it doesn't happen to us\n\nAnd it's so scares us that we avoided and we talk about other things\n\nBut that's just as dangerous as the outrage and justice talks toxic\n\n\nIf you said there was somebody
