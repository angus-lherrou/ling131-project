I didn't even look it up on the Web and you don't even have to be on the phone the phone could just be laying by the bed and that you're having a little uh Ninety night talk that's why I Know how to various these people now turn on a cell look at the Drudge Report the next morning in that top\nBanner out of the top of the Drudge Report says\nSpecial deal on base of it as well wait a minute why I'm a run over here to the Drudge Report\nAnd just oh my God these other\nDo you believe this value\nPizza ovens for the job oh crap big brother is listening that was quick oh and they also use the headline stocks spooked somebody's got to be in a lot of trouble over that one\nI'm going to file a protest can't use the words boot spooky spooky or nothing\nLike it even around Halloween\nAnd all that no boys and girls scare the hell out of all of us will a\nJourney or you know how much the pizza ovens ... older ... older uprising especially if it's wood fired ... would fire pizza and yeah I got a variety to choose from now you don't want the Amazon got 'em for a young\nI don't know I mean I think you know I I feel like\nA conservatives and Republicans get teased by Minnesota a lot and you think oh well maybe this time is going to be the time and a lot of times that never has\nA but we saw that in the presidential election too I mean we how many times the Pennsylvania seem like it was out to me that's going to happen and they never did until this last election where did turn over a I think the more interesting race those the ones for attorney general in Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running\nAnd normally I don't think we talk about a specific attorney general race it's not necessarily national interest is one with Keith Ellison I think is Alison was up by five points in the last full however that Paul happened right before all these sort of accusation started flowing against peace that will not true though is it\nHim in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegations that is I don't there was a new allegation that I Want to repeat it I Believe you're thinking of Cory Booker there was that all of them in our area out yes yes yeah a little bit for that one or not true is it I mean I don't ... as I think you should all these things you are innocent until proven yet he does not even charges against Cory Booker one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man made an editor ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations direct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know\nThat's the way I think you're supposed to hey let's why innocent until proven guilty is a thing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about Chinese relationships break up and there's things that and who knows\nThere's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believed Kavanaugh should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with the they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\nBut it was fascinating at the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda\nWow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time and he's she's credible\nShe's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy\nDated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who\nDoesn't want to hurt the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't right if I wanted to win for I mean it's just crazy yeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they thought they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up\nA instead is forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go\nUh there's a if you're looking at\nA right now a forty a four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have let's see it's forty six excuse me forty ... if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes Tennessee which is\nStill very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burn and then in Texas still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer but then you get a few a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got a another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can do three of six they're going to be at fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they can if they can pull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed or so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a I mean they could to lose it to they could easily still losing possible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six this is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers [noise]\n... ... ... ... is that going back program\nAll right what I Would take a break and we'll tell you

[laughter]\nSo let's talk about the caravan for a second because we really need to decide what\nWe think about this and what we're going to do about it\nWhat do you think we should do about it and you need to have this conversation with all of your friends right now\nWhat do you call people Seventy five hundred who are political Marxist activists that's what they are political Marxist activist marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them as they're marching towards our border\nThey're not refugees they chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathrooms services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can\nMarch twenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good health when they arrive\nThings happen what who's providing medical aid who's providing the water who's providing\nThe trucks that so far we haven't seen anywhere else we aired them yesterday on the news and why it matters in fact Sarah I don't know if we have this video but if we could play this a video\nOr if you have it the the video of a these migrants being loaded up into giant semi trucks\nThey're being trucked from place to place from photo opportunity to photo opportunity\nYou pointed this out there that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers\nAnd it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk now right like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up their racking for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get and they ... they drive\nLook at the ... video enroll that video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi truck\n[noise] just count them\nEven just count them as of right now has a house the that well if you and all of them counted right one all of them counted one ... one one and he said and by the way just to clarify you want you want me to individually point out the women that are women that are quite a big crowd but the women that you can see that the one they're one and a on the um\n[noise] one Mm okay now so this isn't women and children who are these people\nAre we know that MS MS Thirteen now has embedded the people in to this group I mean now Seventy five hundred people\nAnd I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh yeah\nI think it's a I think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWe look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation and then how does it play how was that good for\nThe body if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and but I don't think they're going to wind up in the country or reckon can't I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be hearing you have to chase them around a process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in the past wars for America can\nBe your you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in and entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treat it as an invasion turn way\nYou see this is an invading force these people they're not\nCome anywhere lately [noise]\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying\nAnd closed you could hear it and then they had to find the right material that could do it you know five thousand times without any kind of wear and tear on it\nThat's the work that simply say puts into your system you own it and there's no contract for the monitoring and the monitoring is only fourteen dollars Ninety five cents a month that's it you get ten percent off your system and you won't believe how inexpensive it is it simply safe back dot com per ... per or protect your family\nOr and trust that the company that we trust for our business and for our home simply safe back dot com go there now simply safe back dot com [noise]\n... ... even you were to come to a game here he might I Am [noise]\nPat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not until\nRelief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need\nTo lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick star now only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise] let's see if we can get you out of paying to\nGo to relieve factor dot com\n[noise] gland that [noise]\nYou know uh we had a we have ... we had the governor Abbott on with us and he said mixed inside of that seven thousand you know my grand caravan\nAre MS MS Thirteen leadership and are members embedded in there are these are actual gang rape is\nNow I'm waiting for the left I Can't wait for the laugh to pounce on this how dare you say that gang rapists are in that care of him when they had absolutely no problem\nCalling someone else a gang rapist without proof just recently not a problem I thought that was okay now I thought that was fine and with them is Thirteen they are getting rapists we know they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of the yang in there and some of them are rapists yeah well I think\nThat's part of the thing of getting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA pass on this year's the subscription I I I don't need the member shows are getting free though all you have to do three no thing no thank you kill is what are they going to go a different direction okay is MS twelve available you know no no they're driven out [laughter] yeah yeah I mean that's the I mean\nYou know we've talked about this before MS Thirteen the United states constantly is is that is just Donald Trump fever treat this is nothing is not a big deal where they're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings so if you think MS Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue which I tend to hear\nA lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's still say that again come in that way you don't come in that way that you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThat it's not are not hateful they have if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a Black Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals getting into a Walmart\nYeah ... that's what this is going to be Seventy five hundred people try and just to push through an opening those doors\nThat's all they're doing and this is Black Friday Wal Mart says it going to be fascinating to watch because there is a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome that are not on our borders\n'cause you know what that is that's the Palestinian people yeah\nBut we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that is to not anger us right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and\nThen you end is going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I I Know I Know that so I Know I Know the only reason to believe it's possible but Leno at it if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border\nThis thing has got to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are\nAre National Guard of the worst people on earth and are not going to stand for it and people are generally and I got a van for Seventy five hundred people trying to run over I Hope our border guard either they're not ... that is a that's got to be a real mess yet or you just go away [laughter] [noise]\nYeah that's how I deal with my problem is that while they go away it's really up to Mexico\nStopped them more lose all aid\nDon't lose the election and keep your ... on ... radio\nHolidays

the app store but it's the twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content\nUm that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else\nWell what we were trying to do is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some conservative content so we said\nYou know if we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we wanted to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is I'm a sort of the first step to be able to counter\nThat suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board and obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nSo and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the costs\nFrom your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view talents go back to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um\nUh it is um [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions or so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices [noise]\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we\nNeed a conservative Facebook no we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean\nWe need to be able if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there so how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first pick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this is a Bernie Sanders ACA light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this um and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys name that was all about the contest\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the contact\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with the with the young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going\nYou know you can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older and you know all this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to a the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um an does banding together you know with this program we're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who can go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you because you know you've consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\nBut do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no wave\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said all of it you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media sang\nIt's always about local that as a as the Kavanaugh facing coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think the Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door of the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat I can you continue to vote Democrat\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop\nAnd these are life long you know Democrats a lotta them switched over to vote for President Trump but I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I still you know identify as a Democrat voter so I just rattle off a couple of issues and I'm like\nThat I had to break into your man you're you're you're no longer for in this Democratic Party right so yeah it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out two weeks away\nHow do how do you think the president and ah the Republicans should respond to this caravan coming up\nStop it I mean I think the\nPresident's made it clear where either a country of laws or not and\nIt it you know the the roost that they're using that this is\nUh it's amazing how well the left uses terminology to try to convey people to their side\nBecause now they're asylum seekers you know their asylum seekers or their asylum seekers you apply for asylum in the first country that you arrived to which would be Mexico so it's not about that it's about getting to the United states is about sending money back to their country uh I don't\nEven know if it's about that these guys are\nThese guys are Marxist or that are upset at the the the the politicians in Honduras that kicked their Marxist a guy out who had ties to Venezuela and to Castro in Cuba\nThey've been trying to do all kinds of ... in in Honduras\nThere 'cause they're carrying the Honduran flag that these guys are Marxist radicals at least the leadership is\nI I Would have to imagine that if I was in a their situation if I was legitimately or refugee and I got to Mexico in Mexico was willing to hear my case or process me\nI Would wait in line for as long as it took the helm ... you know myself where my family for them to just break down the barricades and and charge the police officers in Mexico and say guys that you can't stop us we're going all the way the United states and right you know singing Honduras national anthem\nYeah it's ... this is about politics and
