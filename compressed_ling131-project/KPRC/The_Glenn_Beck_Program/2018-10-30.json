O. W. A. Y. poll way California not Poe duck\nAnyway anyway who who's doing this what are they doing\nIs that something you can maybe that's something\nYeah if you buy the new thousand dollar act on that stops maybe wouldn't that be a Jew candy sales to a dozen apple have their big announcement today do they I think today well you should know you're you're gotta keep up with honor that works for the man or yeah you you should\nAnd and it and it's something we need to do\nSo I'm ... so to take the audience through a bit what did you what did you learn from that because I think this is the same thing that's happening when we said Brock Obama is surrounded by socialist look at look at the look at the cover of what was it the Newsweek Magazine said we're all socialist now\nAnd as soon as we said we're going for socialism or they immediately said were racist\nNow when you point out uh George Soros this week the media is trying to say anybody who disagrees with George Soros is an anti Semite that's kind of the same thing that you found in Hollywood with your case is not\n[noise] I did I did and they basically taken the position that\nAnybody that is a Republican or conservative is racist is anti Semite is is a homo phobic and it's just their their way of kind of of the ring us I mean I'm an American of Mexican descent and so and my wife is Mexican she's a first generation\nOr you know a a Mexican American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that attack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous late last waning\nAnd you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided that only tell one side of the story so you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling\nAs a as a way to do that so that's what I ... it was it was astonishing\nKind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on it purely because we were conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that the what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by so few people\nAnd it was just such a fear for losing work and one way and it and on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think that among conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know I I I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking this any more you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new friends here for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red tailed America that's on the heart radio a pod cast a shooting I heart radio excuse me I heart radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you I'm Patrick\nI'm I have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly and thought while she's a great get she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own kind of sixty\nMinutes kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was or at least she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her and\nSo they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it\nThey did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy do you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in the entire me too movement had a big part of that is a lot of people aren't touching on um ... it basically she was you know print brave and doing that\nUm I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering and\nThey don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to\nA man and I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of her because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened\nEgg and Patrick ... were were\nInto the host of red pills America you can hear it on the ah I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith or say there's nothing to worry about this isn't an invasion\nWhat what are your thoughts on the care of them [laughter]\nYou know I think that it is something that for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on\nUm in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is a we actually do an episode\nOr that's coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away\nBut they've completely this prove that ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about\nThat have lost their jobs to chew a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this here I think that is the care of and it is not for political refugee status is people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this\nYou know that's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent feels that because a lot of these kinds of\nIf you've ever seen this place they make I Can't even describe the stuff that's on the menu it's it's I it's life changing here's the only thing I I don't know how Richmond got on I don't know I mean I guess any recommendations from Richmond\nYeah and if you say I mean that's all you got ahead of Virginia been shut up you know peanuts we're looking for fat food that's what we're looking for\nYeah when you see us on tour you'll know you'll know ... are looking for fast\nFood is is why this is understand the Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland I get it so what is it that\nWe're supposed to have enrichment and if you don't come up with an answer we may not show up\nI'm just saying [laughter] so [laughter] we got other cities where we can eat I'm a I Am I I just I thought I'm having a very difficult time uh today and I I I\nI guess it's just time to turn it all off and and I mean does today's the day really for me that I'm like okay I don't have anything in common\nWith the mainstream media at all or uh meet the press wanted me on last weekend and I said no\nAnd they said why you know you have so much to say we are yeah they got what you say that to every you know and the reason why is I don't think\nGoing on expecting to have a conversation and with an actual solution is anything more than insanity at this point how many times we've done this or any of these shows giving us any answers or any of them\nKnow they've got one guy saying one thing and then the following the other guy say any other and you're left in the same place an ... an agenda going on CNN now it's crazy\nThat's crazy I don't know honestly who's watching CNN it's craziness of blaming blaming Donald Trump for Pittsburgh and then Lyndon sour sort\n... you know tweets out we're turning our grief into action with Jewish Action to send a clear message at this anti Semitic Xena phobic attacks never happen again or you can lend us are sort of a fan\nOf Louis Farrakhan the one who brings the women's march leadership to one of the most anti Semitic speeches Louis Farrakhan has ever given [noise]\nYour telling us what anti Semitism is\nThere on a they're living on a different planet and ran\nSome smart in your smart speaker to Google pleaded guilty or see on hard review um\n[noise]\n... gland pac man\nSome [noise]\nChinese

government\nThe Chinese researchers are failing to disclose their military affiliations but they are publishing a large volume of joint patient papers with western scientists\nAre and they are China is funding all of this scientific work they're not saying that they are part of the military there getting western scientists to help them they're taking that that all that study and all that work back to a China which\nIs not really good I don't know if you have um been following the global news because nobody is really\nTelling you about this now\nAh but um\nRussia and China are now openly warnings that they are and I'm quoting preparing for war\nWith the United states um that's not good and then there is um the election that is happening [noise] the\nThe press while they are trying to say that it's All right wing extremism you have the Republican Party headquarters that yesterday I Believe this the headline Republican Party headquarters vandalized\nNow when you think of ... what do you think of spray paint\nOh yeah come right up to spray paint maybe some yeah graffiti and things over toilet paper did they toilet paper now they were\nShooting guns into a the a GOP headquarters so ...\nNow shooting guns is vandalism ...\nReally that's really remember the vandalism heard round the world and that we all remember started sort of a more I'm back in the day or of course when we vandalized Nagasaki and Hiroshima\nSo terribly I forgot about it and vandalism that yeah yeah a lot of them a lot of antelope yeah boy you're right when you're right you're right\n[noise]\nSo we are we are sitting in a in a world and and how do we come together now I\nSaw this did you see data for progress stew [laughter] yeah yeah we've had some good stuff on this actually yeah I think so too I'm Glad to hear you say that so let's let's talk about this these\nAre independent voters and I think the headline here is\nOh look at the independent voters that they want socialized medicine\nWell let let's go through these numbers are bad um elect more women Seventy six percent of independent voters say yes Fifteen Percent say no I I how would you answer that yes or no\nElectric the most qualified person regardless of their genitals or his hair yes I don't care or\nSupport assault weapons ban fifty eight percent say yes thirty nine percent say no\nI mean that's again the salt weapon's ban is a tough it's a tough a summary of what it actually\nIs because of the details matter and people don't know I think it's scary guns but I mean that's not a typical that poll for an independent\nI think this one is really interesting 'cause there's two questions support the rights of kneeling NFL players fifty seven percent of independents say yes thirty nine percent say no\nHowever there's also this question support the actions of kneeling NFL players thirty nine percent say yes and fifty five percent\nSay no so people support\nTheir right to do it but don't agree with what they're doing exactly right now that is not the way the media is portraying dope 'em and I think it's the way most conservatives feel right like yeah they get they can do it but it's not that I mean that's just not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nA support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven percent say no and that if you're wondering why you're getting so many people jumping on that bandwagon it's pulled like that that's why the Democrats are doing it\nDo you want Congress to check Trump fifty three percent say yes thirty eight percent say no also by the way the founders said yes to that one yeah and I said it to any president ... that should be part of the role that should be a hundred ... one hundred percent um\nDo you support them lower investigation fifty two percent say yes forty two percent say no these are independent\nAll around the world calling the gold

pitted against the Senate the house in the Senate pitted against the White House I think the White House then we'll go to the Supreme Court I think all three branches of government are going to be in

chaos but\nThe time is coming where we're gonna have to pay for the mistakes of the past and when it does I recommend that you think like all of the other central banks around the world\nAnd you have something that is real intangible now is the time to go to gold line and get their important to risk information and find out of gold or silver is right for you know you\nYou don't have to do that if

Michael when politicians take it too far\nIt's nothing new this is what happens is natural disasters it's a cheap and easy way to score political points you know grab ratings sell newspapers get radio broadcast to being listened to whatever especially during election seasons but this time this time I had a unique insight into this storm\nOne of the producers on my TV show approached me and said I've got to go to Michael's ground zero\nAnd I said ... y ... volunteering he said no that's where my parents live small town Mexico beach that's where we're all seeing there was nothing left\nAt the

already they're providing workers aid in the area so whatever you need just let me know\nSo he left he disappeared for about a week under the radar and he\nCame back and I said how are your parents
