San Francisco [laughter] and you're just kind of hey Medicare Monaghan Duvall on [laughter]\nAll right to bill O'Riley a last question here on on this stuff tell me about the press and the numbers\n[noise] okay so what's happening is not just in cable news but it's in all kinds of TV watching is that the machines are now overwhelmed the American public your devices whatever you call it the ... started it they don't watch television anymore um my kids used to they don't me more\nAnd NOW News consumption is following in that regard so people are getting used to the fact that Bill O'Reilly dot com is there the blazes there that can get whatever they want twenty four seven I'm so why do I have to sit there and wait for some show to come on that's the under fifty five set in America\nOver fifty five they still like their martinis they liked the courts are they like eight o'clock knowing that somebody is on right\nAnd they ... they're but they're starting to get bored with it back because if you watch it it's not being the same thing said over and over how many times can human beings said the phrase at the end of the day we're now at fifty two million\nTimes on cable news All right it's just in sip it or to the day and sip it um and you you want information\nVibrant opinion that perhaps is a little bit different you never get it and so\nIt's the gas rather than the host the host or ... who they are and you liked them or you don't but the gas I mean it's just impossible along possible it really is the result\nThe always you can see in the demographics it's there on the page every night on the overnight ratings the\nYounger people are going away that's the first sign and then the cracks a once Trump gets off the stage 'cause he drives everything now ... percent in the in the media once he gets off the stage it'll collapse\nSo bill is about a few minutes on your on your book thank you let's uh let's talk about um you know I Know why you wrote this book to two parallel and show the parallels of evil and how that\nCan happen um but I'm I'm I'm fascinated\nBy the stories that that you tell in this\n[noise] let me tell you to a so your listeners will understand what we're doing here and there was a concentration camp name ravens broke\nWas for women just women\nAnd it was north of Berlin and nobody ever heard of it of course a concentration camps were kept away from the German people they weren't spotlight it there was no there were a news report Taj and the third Reich you did what they said or they put a bullet in your head or you went to the concentration camp\nSo anyway at this concentration camp it was a young woman named ... half\nH. U. T. H. and she had a German Shepherd dog as most of the ... did and she terrorized women\nI participated in heinous crimes against it\nBefore the war she was a seamstress and went to work and came home and had a ... or whatever you do in Germany okay and then all of a sudden she's in a black uniform I'm killing and maiming and torturing other people are free off\nAfter the war ends a free comes to San Francisco alright gifts to San Francisco on a refugee visa in Nineteen fifty nine\nAlright settles marries a Jew everybody in the neighborhood loves her ... and nice woman\nFifty years later\nThey get the state department finally tracked shirt sends her back to Germany where she still alive Beck and every month gets to the United states Social Security check\nEarly in the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we became upon an idea that we're in a separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are ethnically separating\nUm and I looked at it on that day is a\nIs a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you were going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do and Clinton I I Will tell you that I ate whatever was written about me was false patently false huh it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever come forward there was all in on them as a source and make a long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut\nTies with Fox and move on and go find another job this could just go on forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mud for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day\nUh I took my wife out to dinner that night and we're celebrating the owner of the restaurant came over and say hey you know congratulations his new start pending I drink on the way home [noise] we got the call or we're driving home and uh\nThe the my phone rang I was a young man on the other side of the phone saying Mr bowling call your son called Eric right away so what's wrong he's just cleric right away I called over there and I'm a girl answered and her name was Kayla he had been seeing her on and off she was crying for some reason I just went right to um is he alive\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] she got now [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] that that was a that was a rough day the next state went to Colorado [noise] and uh the president called me as anything we can do for you I said no thank you [noise]\nUm but at that day and realized that he cared and I'm so for the next few months I made it my mission to to create awareness around\nA opioids\nAmerican uh bought his antics on campus [noise] [noise]\n[noise] in ways with ... ... ... so yeah so that was that day [noise] uh and\nSo now we are a year in\nTwo days after that and it's been rough called\nYou we can stop at any time if you don't want to talk about anything so um but I think it's just important story to tell 'em when you said is he alive\nWhy we're there indications or was it just a bad feeling feeling out who gets called ten thirty at night and it's told the call your son right away without explaining why and I just had a hunch and sure enough the hunch turned out to be true so um\nTurns out he was a he bought his antics on campus that was laced with that no it wasn't a prescriptive antics he didn't know he he passed it was an accidental overdose\n[noise] um so the question you asked me was I going to sue Fox I ... at that moment I had no fighting need to do anything [noise] so um we spent my wife and I just got very close and we spent the better part of the next year\nJust talking to other parents talking or any opportunity we could um do you get the word out that it's an epidemic excuse me and a and a ... parents need to know that that their children are at risk and it's a it's a\nMassive epidemic in the in the country young kids need to know that one pill can kill you and not sure what you're ever taking\nThe parents need to know that your child isn't too smart to popular to Atlanta to be exposed to potentially dying from an overdose it's a very\nEmotional and I think important um interview there\nThere are places that I Want to go and Eric has promised to come back but I didn't want to dog pile we recorded this on uh September I think tense\nUm and it was just a few days after the one year anniversary and he was very very very raw um it's the first time that he is really spoken out about it um and what his thoughts are and I think everybody\nNo matter what side you're on on the opioid thing I mean I I um I got an emotional whole yesterday from somebody on the TV show that said thank you for speaking up for opioids because there are those of us who\nWe cannot live without them we can't pay for this woman said because of her disease she can't even sit up in bed and she's bed ridden\nWithout the opioid there are [noise] you know\nAll of these things they're double edged swords they're they're good when they're used\nProperly and they are deadly when they are abused\nAnd uh it's up to each of us uh to to know what we're dealing with and they are deadly um that podcast also goes into his relationship with the president in what he\nIs seen as the president and uh it's a very fascinating interview\nWith Eric bowling you can find that pod cast wherever you download your podcast I tunes now and modify but everywhere or the Glenn Beck podcast they come out every Saturday and different

doing a two hours of for\nUs everyday tell if anybody if they don't know who you are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] that that are just moving in with pat when you say the second best one hears it is a a pet it's he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number\nTwo [laughter] how moving why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do\nYou know we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them\nBecause we think that one of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time has run that argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs and our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nOr you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I'm a doctor or a diver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but\nI'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress serious\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy assembly has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with the little league game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between that liberal and a leftist that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Eric Harris and likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it's it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are the outside our side of\nThe media Rena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy\nPelosi I Can't talk ... she has no interest in ... he wants to end you want to share a country with\nThe best it's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go\nThat guy's got to be stopped um and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about not I talk about my mom a lot\nBecause she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd roe v Wade happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid of the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people that they can't do for themselves you know and and and it has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away with everything funny things happened the last few years they'll guys she's bringing it up now to me\nAnd she semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all or England or I Can't I Can't and ... do you watch a never ending up when I'm On the year\n... India it unless it's ... hang on just a second I Want\nThe audience to know that's unheard of in our business then that you could not have done this job agreed without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... feet long form it's just toxic ingestion and advanced yeah and my mom watches a lot more of that she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant but one of the things she came to me one day before the twenty twelve election\nAnd she brought it up she started bringing politics up to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when Brock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watched the things he says and he does if he's actually a communist [laughter]\nI wouldn't be a way out and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine whites Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be provided things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine we we get five hundred million dollars a year at your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not fine with\n... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care okay we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side they're not for communism they're not for the end\nSome smart and yours orange speaker to Google it could be or see on my heart radio I'm\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you the loan them the right for\nCall today and it gets started\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo I talked about this a little bit on the news and why it matters last night uh and I and I asked the group it\nWas a turning point for the Democratic party the leadership\nI think it was there was a spiritual turning point and it was when they didn't hide God three times in their platform I mean I just I find it incredible that they actually did it three times I mean it's just so biblical mhm\nAnd you are you are seeing\nA in you're seeing the things that I talked about in my in my novel the eye of ...\nPeople don't know that they are repeating rituals they don't know what's really going on but there we are repeating the Old Testament stuff from the Democrats really are\nProgressive is him and I think this is why the churches on the defensive collectively in the culture it's because\nIt is it it's looked at the clown show that we often see on right wing cable news of\nGuys who pretend to be ministers but really they're just ministers of the church or wherever the GOP guy that gives them\nOn the table at the moment is or a Democrat or the Democrat on the other side you're right but I mean in terms of people have a discerning spirituality which would tend to lean more conservative ... and so there's a lot of a discerning people in our poll pits that\nHad decided they don't want to be the next Ralph Reed clown show on cable news basically and so they're just going to vacate the public sphere altogether which is kind of a false choice really yeah\nBut and it's because they don't understand that progressive isn't isn't a political ideology it's a religion\nIt is it's the it's the and I say this on our show all the time Glenn it's the it's the area is Marcy on CollegeACB no great heritage throughout the course of the history of the church that's what this is of this era it has its own Herman nuke\nIt has its own creation myth dosing Darwinism it has its own in ... where the state essentially replaces the church and government is the becomes God like chest hurts and said when the government removes the God the government will become the God\nAnd that's what you're dealing with here the same reaction you're getting from a leftist when you trigger them on their on their state isn't it the same reaction that you would get with your beliefs if you walk down the walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan a quote unquote moderate Arab nation\nWalk down the streets of Amman, Jordan where they're queen is a Seventy five on a scale of one to ten and a king seems to be a modern her mind in his right walk down the streets of Amman, Jordan said this guy say I'm Christians and Muslims worship the same God makes year wearing ... and find out first that they have a Second Amendment in ... in Amman, Jordan because your life will be in danger\nAnd that's what you're witnessing here this is religious fervor\nYou're you're attacking their idol this is not near political disagreement this isn't even just fundamental existential philosophical disagreement this is religious fervor you're dealing with the loose it sanity that coach predicts\nI just want to say the first part of that a dissertation I only understood about ten\nPercent [laughter] pet them short races\nThey translate that into human language [laughter] uh I I I think we see that\nWith global warming with a with their reaction to abortion within this Robie weight thing that means absolutely everything they worship at the altar of these things ... it it really is a religious fervor\nYou know that you see with them and and this is kind of the the point of the eye of ... ... is\nThis is ... this is the his\nYeah they if they don't necessarily know they don't know it but that doesn't change the fact that what they're doing it was the worship of the environment and the sacrifice of your children he wanted your children to be sacrificed on an idle\nYou would have permit skew is sex at a celebration of bail you could do anything in the woods and the groves in the groves and then when you got pregnant he would call you back and they would slaughter the newborn baby right I I mean it is exactly the worship of bail\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well when he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one\nWhere he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did bad stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself", "year":
