man\nWe're talking to Dr James Lindsey author of life in light of death or he is or even follow him at consensual a conceptual James a on a on Twitter he is one of the but if not the mastermind behind a the a\nPapers of record that were were being written\nA four four feminist studies and queer studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nAre not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are going in through the back door which is not something we are going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out\nOf the violence of objective vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it does not get accepted the journal is inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just it says this is a sovereign act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are at recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nOnce that are turning how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means faced\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the re privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temporary thing we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they used to watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort\nWhich means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being completed\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil\nAnd that's the worst part is is it's only a small step\nFrom what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claim for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on\nBut um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what what would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania\nWho was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year so this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some are educators primarily working and\nSocial justice size field topics courses I guess\nThe best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to using the classroom and this was being submitted to\nAnything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't really remember you know you are an American I'm an American your person I'm a person\nWith the ... most of the things that we think in common even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to hear better conversations we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details\nAnd I really hope that you know that our project kind of reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally
