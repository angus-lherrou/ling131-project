Roberts in your family your from El Paso and none of them go by betcha\nNone of them do what um what is your what is your background are you a boring white person\nI Am I'm born and raised and I get that question all the time are you military and they say no there are white people here in El Paso\n[laughter] met it's allowed they do allow that okay good\nAh that's interesting I ah I can that seems to be evidence against ... it does we really should report this to him when he goes on national TV and says these things you know the fact checked hard today is going to get a ... day for 'em\nYeah thankful that my gosh oh wow very upset about this so that's well only every person who is called so far has contradicted a Beto yeah on that and that's\nWhy like I you know we want to be factual we want to deep deep deep into the science and that's what we're doing here you know a pat and I both come from a scientific background um and that's why we've always looked at you know for what our one of our examples of courses better Weinstein who was a brief here oh\nHe's an amazing things so I Will I Hope we can get ... nailed down\nUm let's see we got burner burden in Texas\nHi good morning I'm much fun there I have a twin brother named\nDrilled it still it Bert as an adult way calling Robert okay or that\nYou do you do get better okay now what is your background are you ah are you a boring white person or something that would be positive in our society\nWhere Americans of Mexican\nDescent trial case has his own Hispanic when they mean like ... ... ... ... I called myself and American an excellent decent first of all my name is\nMy name is bad\nI like to be called burger or get this Bobby\n... wow see okay so you're going to the other way you're going from ... to Bobby which is interesting in the ... [laughter] Oh yes\nThat name for forty years and ah I don't like to be called birth that which is that natural inclination from people\n... and I know that do personally oh you do I work\nI used to work for the NBA no Paso as the secretary to the director and assistant director when he first started as a came in Congress he's very adamant about helping veterans and we were overjoyed because we needed help getting the message out about the veterans\nMhm [noise] well\nIt ... when I came on the a lot of my information 'cause I knew what was going on and stuff the casting my desk and everything when I found out that\nBad though\nWas running for Senate I knew he had used the veterans as a launching point and they need to do with them under the bus\nWell ah to get his name to get his name nationally known by the way my calling him personally myself I come in ... case [laughter]\nAttractive gang late\nHe's got that weight Adam's apple and it sticks out for a long time um\nI don't want to seem like an angry Hispanic female mhm I Am ... an angry conservative and oh I forgot to tell you I had my best friend and she stayed in Albert she goes to them but he never agent ... and\n... ... ... and it's like an ... and thank you for the call it just seemed like that there is a a there was an effort made when you when you prioritize identity politics over everything else\nThese things are sensible right like a sensible that Barry Obama was bronco bummer right he is sensible in that world it sensible if you're Elizabeth Warren to claim you have Native American heritage and\nIn in your school and and submit to a ... recipes to pow chow like that makes sense in that world because that's all you prioritize it's the only thing that matters\nRight if the only thing that matters is your identity as a victim\nThen classifying yourself a as associated with a victimized population of evil conservatives\nDoes a lot of good for you there's a real incentive and motivation to do it and we keep we seem to see it over and over and over again\nAnd you know look maybe she was called better was ... I don't know uh it's possible I haven't seen a ton of evidence that it's accurate nor that it makes any sense but beyond that ... the idea that he has put on every single sign solely\nBefore letters B. E. T. oh\nThis is not like that might be a nickname and it might be that it's okay to call him back home but if this is not he's not doing it because that the uh the case he's doing it because he's trying to fool a bunch of people especially back you know when he was trying to get to this level at this point\nI don't know I think everybody knows but it helped him climb to this level\nAnd it is the name that appears on the ballot too which is interesting very strange very strange ... a lot of times if it's a nickname\nThey'll put like Robert Francis and then in parentheses Beto O'Rourke so you can identify him from you know his campaign ... stuff which that kind of makes sense although I I don't even love that went on that in my only Beto O'Rourke on the ballot so that I mean the guy has gone to great lengths\nNot to use Robert Francis not to be identified as Irish American now if you press them on it he's obviously going to admit I'm Irish American it come from a long line of Irish Americans right but that's not what you get from him when you just watch his uh\nHis campaign ads or you see I'm In a debate he doesn't know he doesn't identify like that at all trying to\nBe a Kennedy right he like he wants to be a Kennedy and a plot you know a appeal to the Hispanic community and it's like you're ... you're not be F. K. okay we all know who we have Kay was he's been gone for a long time [laughter] we all know that you're not the F. K. and just stop trying to BBS ... you're not that\nHe's working on it though it's dry and these these dry and [noise] I mean better ... better Fitzgerald Kennedy was an incredible\nPerson we'll [laughter]\nAnd it was weird ... tragedy and yeah I mean it really was an amazing or turn\nOf events there and it's good to see it's good to see a that this has gone on I I I just I don't\nI don't see how people don't see through this\nYou know I and I think maybe on the left they don't want to because they think he has a chance you know every few years the the the left gets the terrible teeth or they get to get close in for in a few polls Wendy Murphy is going to change Texas was the mayor refused and that was going to change Texas a\nOh a number you were to use them and when you were down there yeah yeah sort of a moderate leaning a Democrat he was also going to change\nTexas every time they run somebody there's somebody who's going to just change it and it's going to\nIt no longer we'll have to deal with these darn Republicans down their return the state blue we've won forever and by the way that part of it is true if they start they turn that they really do yeah yeah that's true they will run they will run the country for a very long time if they're capable of doing that just from an electoral vote standard\nBut still it's a it's not ... it's it's a way to suck the money out of small donors were throwing it away you know we keep hearing how bad people have it\nFor X chair or ex chair back dot com [noise]\nDon't use a little bugs or if you're on TALK radio

that program you can also hear my show 'em every weekday immediately preceding this one from us seven to nine eastern time triple eight Seventy seven be easy K oh it's going to Jack in Pennsylvania a Jack you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi\nHey pat and Steve Love you guys [laughter] I I think you're missing a very important point and that is that over ... identifies as Hispanic [noise] uh therefore ... you must be belief wow there's a great\nPoint here is again we're learning today yeah I forgot that was the standard\nHow insensitive of us mhm how hateful and are downright ugly that is that we haven't spoken about how he does identify yeah and it must be as Hispanic\nJak ... interesting with that sort of talk like\nYou know the the Elizabeth Warren is of essentially identifying as Native American without real evidence that she is she's getting beat up I mean this has been one of the biggest political disasters of all time\nHer coming out and trying to say that she actually is Hispanic Native American short approved it by going back ... generation trying to prove it one one thousand twenty fours yeah that's amazing a left hates it through like this is this is playing into the worst of our\nUh beliefs about you know blood being the determining factor and these things and they they hate it they're\nThey have destroyed or over the she handled it terribly I mean it's almost like one of those things I don't know maybe they should have leaked it through another source of the fact that she's associating herself with coming out and doing this is this amazing\nAh but the identifying thing there's two parts of that like I said as a you know say that you know\nThe libertarian side of me right like I don't care what people say they are right like it makes no difference to me if she says she's Native American or not I don't care\nBut beyond that there's an actual truth\nYou know if it does all what's to come out and say she's black or Sean King wants to come out and say he's black when they're not black it it does that matter to me I don't care what they're doing there I think they're lying right and they're doing this for a reason but that doesn't mean it affects me in any way\nHowever we have to be able to stand up for the truth the truth is that Sean King is white but the truth is Rachel does all is white and the truth is that Beto O'Rourke as white as white\nAnd you know I that's okay [noise] you know people are supposed to be able to be you know we're not supposed to care so much about these identifying factors but we're in a world in which the ... only embraces identity politics the tech world we need to curate\nSome smart in your smart speaker to Google it could be or see on my heart radio um\nDo [noise]\n\nAnd you're listening to Glenn Beck command [noise] fence to Tripoli Seventy Seventy CK Glen\nIs going to be back from his a trip um Monday we think right now he is a I I think he's he's climbing to write right this second yeah right I think they're getting they're like the two thirds of the way to the summit\nDead second tie a highest peak in the world some people say if the highest in the most difficult to climb and we probably should have spent more time on this I Know Glen Glen does not want to bring it up because you know he you know it feels like it's bragging or whatever but yeah ... ... to this weekend you can follow his progress I I I Know there's a website I don't remember what the name of it is but if you kind of go out to search for\nA Glenn Beck climbing K. two it'll probably pop up\n... because I think they're doing this on the dark Web yeah a lot of ... lot of time you do yeah some reason he puts up on the dark Web uh so I don't I don't know maybe you'll have to find that there\nAre but we're we're uh we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke a Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle a lot of people calling in and saying that they\nKnew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and then there's this is it could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and\nWe leave and all these people who are uh you know from the different cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of look into as a possible cause for bed does a confusion here um there are issues however when you try to appropriate culture\nOr when you try to reach into some other uh cultural group and and and speak to them sometimes there are issues there is a case of this that the media is like ... is is like liking to highlight today\nA and it just it's a commercial run on behalf of a congressman in Arkansas a French Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely if you watch CNN Today he will be\nYou know blamed for it to ... to ... hours or it's just some unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance law situation um where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum\nWhich is completely unconstitutional to have in this country\nOr when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is a bad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your column whether you can detect anything seems a little odd here I'm here is the ad from the group supporting French so\nWhy do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may bring she and the Republican notice dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black means the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation\nAnd witnesses including her best friend said it didn't happen\n... founders when white girl lies on them\nOn the election black folk and gloom turnout always told myself don't mess around with that if you get she will crime rate\nTo keep Congress let fame chair and the Republican because we\nHave to protect our men and boys we\nCan't afford to the white Democrat take us back to the bad old days of rain the verdict life ... ...\nWhat are white girls going into a\nPaid for by black Americans for the president's out into not authorized by any candidate for candidates Khamenei\nFirst of all I Would normally watch his show with ... I had to do that all sounds fantastic and these are obviously really going there making yeah right like the point of\nAnd it's a fascinating thing from the left who thinks that you know we one of the biggest reasons Beto is in a in the public eye in the in the United states and not just a Texas figure is because of this video he made about it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem\nAnd what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence being shot at the streets for no reason because for crimes they didn't commit\nAt the same time we're supposed to get on board if you're on the left are supposed to get on board with\n... with the with a new standard in which any white woman can accuse the man over rape and we're just supposed to believer that is not going to work out well for African Americans or any ... any race if a male but this is the type of thing that makes no sense\nI mean there are real cases of this this isn't a fake thing go back to you know we talked about till town go back to Emmett Till\nI mean this goes back a long way where black people were accused of doing terrible things to white people when they get into\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know I don't think the best of our our ...\nDone [laughter] All right thank you for the call I work I we I mean Robert Britain's Iraq I'm comfortable calling him I'm comfortable with Bob Frank uh O'Rourke which is fine too but I just don't pick better words [laughter] no not at all [noise]\nYou've got to see a pattern and have their little bit and you know Republicans slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent so you get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and I'm fifty six was outlier\nMost of the time it's right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house well again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came out the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district thought he did a good job his opponent announced two point six million ... this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race would be a would this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean Beto O'Rourke was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz's influenced by your heart rate made a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world\nUm but I mean he he's raised this doesn't even clue Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidate himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was it compares to Brock Obama's racing and what she really wants\nMore in the in the uh if you compare quarter last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nThat's a that's a presidential election emphasizing this is a ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win\nUh-huh now it's funny in the Senate race record he broke was the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race\nThough Rick loggia wasn't a bad candidate was not a close race it was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear between Iran and fifty and almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five\nThat's a big she is um and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um\nWe haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days and knowing how we just\nYou know we have a going back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent\nOnly eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about\nThe Senate there's a little bit of there was a little bit of something there should be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're gonna see a fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of said oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas\nAre those who were in question of ... I I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more\nI think it'll be a double digit I think there's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah I think that's where he stands right now yeah or Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think you've got tossed up in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida in ... Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top ... yeah well I saw it's close but um they pretty much a toss up race but\nThose other I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do a rifle junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here I\nThink Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that as your brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nI don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you\nComplain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski Joe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them all of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all\nTime I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a craft or now communist again the socialist in communist yeah I mean the most\nPart you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that's the seat and Mick Sally is running for a\nWell he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah but you know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro trumped state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was czar they would go for I mean I mentioned got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know ... you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capable almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mentioned you've got his cabinet vote you\nHave a couple of but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a he's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading it\nSome smart and your smart speaker to Google played it could be or see on my heart radio I'm\nHonest black sorghum which perfected at

where they have to put a sign up where in the voting hall ... but he was still on the ballot buddies dad who's still on the ballot but he's dead but people are still don't\nKnow if he wins or who serves they will nominate a Republican to replace them I guess so this is your weight and this has happened in previous races well we're ... candidate passes away and then people still get them what's the Missouri whereas there he had nothing to really died and his wife yeah\nA served in his dad yeah yeah so\nI mean that's all they won't be one of his hookers though it will be someone else I don't know we don't know what do we do a business partner uh you know ... yeah of [laughter] can be\nI mean who knows it could be I mean we don't know how many Republican hookers he has it could be on a high percentage we don't know we don't know [laughter] I find out but I think that's got to be interesting you're voting for someone who's who's dead and and the NFL self described him [laughter]\nOh yeah that was just I mean it was that was the deal yeah Republican world 'cause he's ... he's a Republican big a big ... he ... he ran one other time in almost won the last time and they have is actually going to win it looks like well\nI'm I noticed that you are still talking about Glenn and his canoe trip but I look for the go pro video online and\nThen did you did you check the dark Web it's on the dark Web no yeah that's weird oh yeah oh uh it's interesting because\nWe I just got an email here it says uh this is is doing pat I may be your only listener who's actually staring at the Mediterranean\nSea as they listen [laughter]\nI can ... that Glenn is nowhere to be seen rowing near\nAnd mountain the oh well that was his departure pulled that's where he left from there so he'd be a long way from there now yeah yeah you're not gonna be able to hear\nFrom ocean good to be there at well yesterday or the day before probably yeah yeah they're yeah he'll be back on Monday though we think well he's he he he's already done the canoe thing across the Mediterranean and now he is uh he's climbing a cake too\nAs we speak and all that training is done is paying off man it's paying it\nSure is and you can tell when you look at him\nAlso by the way it was a lot of us that work out like that\nNow they are when you're you're ... you're put you guys in the same category [laughter]\n\nSo do the effort [laughter] good news good news coming I Know that ah you know everybody was concerned about a a carbon taxes but they're going to be here the Exxon Mobil is announced that they're going to give a million dollars to the Americans for carbon dividends and that means that uh the carbon carbon taxes out its way\nCan hang on Exxon Mobil is doing this that's why they're getting there but on the leaf [laughter] why are they why are they ... like\nThe ... now there's some belief that actually caving we're just giving ... million to pretend like they're four and they're not really so so that's very possible\nThat was the lead to get people off their back and get nobody off your back they know disbelief then you're ... you're just re ... just said they were faking it yes and so you never you don't get the credit for this and of course you know it is an interesting thing\nWhen it comes to a new government regulation all these companies that go through and and what free enterprise when they're coming up in the world right when they get to be the biggest boys they light and some of these new taxes and regulations because he'd wind up punishing upstart competitors\nYou know exercise can swallow a little bit of a stroke a regulation and not not deal with it and that's why Google writes things you know they're they're heavily involved in in a lot of the net neutrality theft and I got her Google ... like they can take a little bit of it they deal with it and if the you know if the guy down who's starting up something new that winds up getting punished\nBut listen we all I think we all can agree that something has to be done because uh now\nWhat what we can not all of the things that they're going to try it or not it will share the latest
