especially over in England but I think\nThat there is a misunderstanding sometimes with the press there are bad people who are you know racist and ... and everything else\nBut I think that they're

two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in ... red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Chevy Cruze going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou mean you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so yeah the point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point um uh uh several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see the ... news well I didn't say that they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happens and then you score after right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the results that in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point\nYesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is very tend to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a\nIs part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that poll wound up up a nine point in that one and he seemed to be honest when their eyes open up a lead there again and I'm not surprised by it either out a surprise that will get into all the details coming up [noise]\nHouston

economy I'm Still I on the stock market especially at these low low prices right\nNow so what happened yesterday what what what spooked it\nWas a good question where I'll scratch your head wondering what it was I mean Donald Trump seems to think it was the ... and there's no question that the fed interest rate hike a and their announcement that they're going to continue to raise interest rates certainly more people out of stocks and bonds because one interest rates rise and\nBonds are more attractive relatively than stocks I'm usually those effects of of ah\nFat changes are short term so\nI don't I don't think you're going to see how long term effect from that although I tend to\nAgree with Donald Trump that here we've got this blooming economy we dollar shave real science of inflation although energy prices are rising but the other commodities are are pretty stable or or actually falling price so I don't see a big inflation gain and ... I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to this is\nThe fed and and uh John John Powell why you take in a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring I tend to I tend to think\nThat he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just discuss the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to squash a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment as we see in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm a inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation ... watcher guy I was I was ...\nBe concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that is we have international trade\nWe have um you know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and trade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't that sort I Am a little concerned by the way out of ... about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like\nEquivalent of four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why has it gone up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\nTo a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\nYou know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf our tax that back on line bring Texans Becca brings Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick on the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again\nSo [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know this\nThe stock market is driven by fear and greed [laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife I let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last\nPresident that I heard really take on the bed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a a you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week I don't know why the\nPresident as his chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out I'm not look I don't want to see\nOf politicization of the fat correct type I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years\nThat these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes so you're going to mention I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage\nInterest rates that was all because of fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven an age of ... I keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars a and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think isn't even [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that the Arabs are good\nHere's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal or where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before the\nThe deal had to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this plan but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an electoral property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China let me\nChallenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about this like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't they were ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look\nWe're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to\nPlay by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time is blind who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company you have to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live with that in his right eye when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't or bank at\nThe same time I would feel better about it hey\nStephen quickly one quick question for you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs and these things going on allies are ... like Canada and ... as a way of negotiating to bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA two point oh type of situation\nWill happen but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy Larry Kudlow so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something\nLike a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but\nWe've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produced I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a ... you know\nBudweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and ... that's going on around the country our auto producers are a lot of us are more expensive because the steel towers so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this so\nWas were winning were winning\nCommonsense is winning it doesn't feel like it but that's just because the power structure that you're used to\nIs no more and when you look at what's happened and you look at the Democrats\nSaying the things that they're saying now that you know Eric\nEric Holder today the latest
