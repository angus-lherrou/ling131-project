Mexico professional organizers probably from the Democratic party in Jordan's arose came to see them and the same guy said well\nI'm going to America because we're faced much political oppression and our own land and fear for our safety uh-huh oh forces there are trying to kill us we're only trying to save ourselves that our children from certain death and political pressure and that's all about what happened all the jobs and all the cool\nWell one next place just as good as another as long as we're coming just\nMet with the organizers and I said that's not what we're supposed to say we're supposed to say this that's what we're dealing with here before we go I just\nHave to warn you once again about these kind of things when you're taking pictures to upload on the Internet like this woman who was selling some furniture\nCareful of reflection a woman recently tried selling some furniture online she didn't realize when she took the picture of the piece of furniture is a wardrobe they call it it had a little mirror on it\nAnd when she took the picture in the mirror look clean reflection of her naked boobs she was taking the picture topless\nSome bodies spotted it and now it's gone viral\nAnd we're just scum aren't we have people the stuff don't forget boys and girls to\nEat it every day you must be the greatest radio talk show host forever future generations will find cost saving\nFor future generations wolf Johnson\nReport is ... by ... south west Houston Hi I'm Jessie wasn't very general manager genuine ourselves but she used in each of pro surfer Creole January undergoes a one hundred and sixty five or inspections and safety check only then is it ready for its next adventure visit us in January southwest using dot com [noise]\nHow would you like a second source of income without having to work a second job does that sound just about too good to be true well my friends that online training academy can show you how other people are doing this every day you see expands\nThe search for answers and the resume and murder of a journalist I'm Dave Anthony Fox News secretary of state Pompeo has left her here where he held talks a day after meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised\n[noise] was I going to happen I mean [noise] it's a bigger picture first of all back I'm addicted to outrage like you are ...\nAddicted to\nOut a ... and I know\nThe bigger picture here is this the Democratic party\nIs confused now they don't know what to do right I'm Juanita Broderick claimed that Bill Clinton tried to rape depression never in a million years is going to give that allegation\nAny exposure at all non stop going to happen so you can talk about it I could talk about whatever\nShe had much more I mean she was credible she was okay but it's\nJust not gonna happen than not going to get back into it um and they didn't report it when it happened\nArgue why are they then getting into the Monica Lewinsky thing\nBecause they have to at least acknowledge that Hillary Clinton beyond all rationality is that is putting herself out there in these positions where she is the re litigate this stuff\nThe reason she's doing it is she wants to remain relevant\nSo she can run again for president [laughter] no I'm Serious come on come on back I'm I'm really you you know that I'm the most brilliant political analysts in the country now I don't I Am\nTelling you that she wants to run again for president and\nTo know I Know she wants to run do you really think she will\nIt depends depends\nA lot on Biden it depends a lot on um whether she feels that the field against terror is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton\nThey don't know what to do with that All right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on a road in there and and talk to their\nDevoted supporters this isn't an accident [noise] this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day that's what this is\nIt ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly but if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now\nExtremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that a non\nAmerican ... [laughter]\nNo that rushed her yeah horrible crushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we actually got a little bit a blood on an average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves came as a knock it off where she's not Cherokee\nUm this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off\nThe chair and ends themselves crazy\nOK and war and he used that ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the room\nTo advance their current and academia so\nAnd this is a woman who think she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts that may be at Oregon you know these days that she can get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate no way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist ... uh do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three\nThat she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um she was a chair or as a mother or you know was a source of all of\nThis but look I'm getting back to to Beck's a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed oh yeah\nAll right so she doesn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she doesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't really she lets them\nYeah she's a system a Paul would they call in New York ... Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes\nOr so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for a price on another democratic ticket\nAnd you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg is very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty but I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's the reverse\nYou know they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPraying near to the you know I'm not sure you need the uh the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I were to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really matter anymore\nDrop smash that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments\nAnd and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right it\nMight ... you know this was in her time the next time around you want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk to about I'm ... and what

they want the father's left politicians they can get and they have it\nSo now he had a guy wheeler the mayor the town Rosa police bureau that's what they call it there\nAre basically says I'm not going to force the law not going to do it and that poor woman uh is going to be assaulted verbally and not allowed to walk where she wants and that's okay with me\nMayor Ted Wheeler that's fine and I'm going to tell my officers don't help that women don't interfere there\nAnd also I'm going to lead antifa a surround the ice headquarters\nAnd I'm going to let them do pretty much whatever they want to do including fighting on the street using masks over their faces carrying weapons they can do what ever they want to do now\nIs this America you would think the people Portland, Oregon would rise up white\nThat they would go out in the rose city which signs condemning the mayor and antifa and mass tens of thousands of them\nThey gather by that while I'm at river with their size this is not the city we want to get anybody out there doing that\nNobody so this is the problem the problem is that when you lower the problem is that in ... the problem is the people in Portland, Oregon\nAnd that's why I wrote killing yes ask 'cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil and ... is evil\nSo I get my ... I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that\nThere isn't a an uprising or ... in Portland or they are the\nBlind to it for some reason or do they actually support it are they afraid to come out what is the what's the only real readership\nAnd they ended in Montgomery County so if I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out\nUh on the banks of the ... wherever I'm going to be there at a ten in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility it'll it'll be two um unfortunately\nBecause there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAll right they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe they're not like me\nAnd maybe people hit me or I'm not going to do it\nIt's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people we really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want dogs on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten the grave we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats a hundred percent got any politicians ... the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre and now now now they're saying that the ... he was alive and aware as they were dismembered bring him\nA it is just an amazing story I'd love to hear your take on it and also if you were the president or advising the president what would you do when we come back [noise]\nDon't miss the next ... or see on ... radio\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're in room ...\nBill the frustration is growing in America the press is excusing a antifa they are excusing everything that Democrats are saying uh than other Democrat up in ah Minnesota came out over the weekend and said\nIt's time to bring the guillotine out for the Republicans I'm I mean it's it's it's remarkable what is being said and dismissed when there is actual violence on the streets\nYou um you said in a minute ago you know rise up and and fight this how do you do that and not make things worse\nWell I Do a peacefully number one and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and um maybe we go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nOr with five hundred signatures are attached to it so the Oregonian for example a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group\nThis is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's homeless some possible but I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ss as really essentially about\nAnd and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage and um if we continue down this road with the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most and arts elements in our society the press sympathizes with all of them\nThey sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics they sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive\nCauses so ... that's a big\nDifference we didn't have that what was that a left wing press we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um\nUh I beg to differ with you on the and the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties or some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say as a you know some group with standing in the community\nUh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I um and they followed the king I'm a rules where you just never swing back\nAh that group most likely is going to be beaten up for doing it by anti ... but in the Nineteen sixties\nPress played that coverage I don't think the press plays that coverage this time you know somebody else\nWill take a cell phone video and throw it out there\nJust what happened is that an over the weekend is that in the group\nDoing that would have to hire security they'd have to hire people to protect them um you can do this\nIt just takes it takes leadership it takes organization but but on the press thing look let's let's segue into Saudi Arabia now because the press is actively trying\nTo go you saw it on sixty minutes solidly still\nTry to do with Trump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush\nThat nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad but Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran in the middle east\nIt's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt Iran is terrorism\nAnd destruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading that charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good\nBut the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence of that\nThey'll do it and it's free right now you can order through October thirtieth and you'll save

I think actually we should start a team of some sort and we should come up with a Native American name ourself really yeah yeah I'm a you know people seem to be going the other way\nThat they're all yeah I Do think it's about time that\nWe go the other way I think it's about ... I had enough of it so\nYou know\nYou have a if you have a name a for something you know that we started baseball team or you know something you don't just\nInside the blaze with that'd be cool you can send us the or the team name and the mascot and we'll get together and have a pow about it and see what we can do\nUsed with ... everywhere creepy or see on all your review\nFor four years here at the blaze ah people around the offices have been using relief factor and it's made a huge change for a lot of people\nAre Glenn it's been very transparent about suffering with pain as you may have heard for the last few years and most of it as my backside caused by stew [laughter]\nBecause out of the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water are becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health of these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS\nHounded um ... the ISIS people I've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true [noise]\nWe we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there\nUm and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and it it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no choice but to fight and die\nThey can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they look like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys had to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care it so yeah\nSo you went from that um to say and I I've got to do I've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes\nAnd now you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update forth yes absolutely so\nAh also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as ... or ... you were telling me that you were trying to organize a yes or people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly\nAnd I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border\nAnd they they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have been as their infants help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe 'em\nAnd they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's a really really good thing\nUm [noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes are done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have us because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the um civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the ... army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive\nSo why why are they doing this why are they doing this to these tribes [noise]\nIt's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lands they want to control the entire\nRegion and so if you're a different ethnicity you can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve the ... and also\nThe for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus they don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're there's ... there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me so I brought a brought with me several photos\nHave somebody um or as ... they're apologizing for getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf\nOf what I see all the time when I go to these places [noise] [noise]\n[noise] and these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you handy photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby\nThat's a baby intentionally and killed and that baby didn't die right away I Survived for about twenty four hours and then died\nAnd this just looks like it's in the woods\nYeah they're out in the jungle and these people have nothing and farm army still wants to attack them and take more from them\nAnd so every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the\nOr at least it's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nMy again like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting because you can be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean real flop here we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried to\nGet ahead of this or again it is a ... it's an important political story for somebody who's going to run for president yeah\nBut really with Saudi Arabia [noise] going on right now with\nThat and what that possibly means shouldn't we take a pause and look and some of the stock market anybody know why yeah and I anybody talking about that why is it now you mean\nDoing so good everywhere over to Google it could be or CD on August ... radio [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWell new program so glad that you are here um we're going on tour here soon and we would love to see you grab your tickets now to Glenn Beck dot com tour were coming to a theater near you it's Richmond Hershey Pittsburgh Cleveland Kansas City\nUh Tulsa Tampa Orlando and other cities around you make sure that you'd grab your tickets or you can do to Glenn Beck dot com slash tour or we're going to see\nIf you can spend as much as a democratic socialist [laughter] it's a game show that I don't think you can win no you don't want and we all lose in the end and you know we do is the sad part\nOf the sometimes do Democrats can be very positive for Republicans sometimes democratic candidates are big win for Republicans really and we're seeing a case of this here it appears in Texas where Beto O'Rourke or Robert Francis or if you know as his parents wanted him to be known 'em\nIs going by as he used to call themselves going right when it was cool when it when it's beneficial to be called Bobby called himself Bob yeah now he calls himself that's all right so Beto\nIs running here in Texas and if you don't have and you haven't seen this you haven't been watching\nA any national media as far as not just politics I'm playing outside of that Ellen and cold there and you have an hurry where CNN town hall coming up tonight just him um again it's bizarre the reason why it's helpful for a Republican is\nBeto O'Rourke has drained the Democratic donor base out of thirty\nEight million dollars and going to have gone to close races ... you know it all seems like\nCruz is a winning here and winning by significant margin though we don't we obviously we still have a few weeks ago we know this could change but\nThe well they could produce the pictures of his father actually pulling the trigger on JFK and that may need to be actually may need that yeah well they might have it and I never know they might\nUm they're talking now about a a fifty to forty three margin is the so seven point or sees me fifty two forty five is the\nIs the margin now with cruise leading by seven points this is from by the way the the same company that is hosting the town hall with Beto tonight CNN their poll thank you forty five\nI think he wins by twelve and maybe as high as a team\nI mean that would be a real surprise or no it would be but you know that one is what really what happened last time Ted Cruz ran I mean the polls are are hard in Texas I I don't necessarily believe believe the polls here in Texas\nYou know it'd be great if he won it would be one by three but I I just think that there is is something that ah you know when you get when you when you get right down to it Texans are going to say yeah I ... I\nTend to think he's gonna win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here and lack of this\nIs when you buy a much larger margin or ... I don't have the one in right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know there's money by so much heat up eight Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results in St Paul is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for\nA Greg habit that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact same base the\nOther thing that's interesting about it is the um ... you think of it break bread country right in Texas ... however are the poll shows the fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters words a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas\nIt this way try this on for size\nOr a Donald\nTrump is\nEverywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
