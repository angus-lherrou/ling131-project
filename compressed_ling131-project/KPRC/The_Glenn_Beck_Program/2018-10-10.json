O. doesn't do anything and yet he's the highest paying died in the building what's wrong with this picture\nThat are weird how we're just saying we notice things that's all they need another survey they're holding steady in the news game at Ninety two percent negative\nAnd study out they don't believe that by the way\nTV's coverage of Trump Ninety two percent negative even if it was fifty two percent negative that that would seem to be you know a lot\nThere they're doubling down on ignorance at low yeah Hillary all these\nLike Hillary talking about well you can't be civil war these people are they want to they they want to destroy everything you stand for\nYou know just like you want to destroy everything they stand yeah but they don't see that from the other side because they're hypocrites so they've ... they've adopted this oh I don't care how negative it is we're just gonna keep saying the dirty things about them and see if it starts working\nNothing about this Ninety two percent of the news that you get on television is a negative about Trump think about all the news that you don't get at all like for example Trump speaking in Iowa he mentions a Feinstein\nThey started chanting lock her up lock her up not in the news that's just one of the dozens of stories every day the media chooses not to report so that in itself is negative news about Trump isn't even getting counted in the study\nBecause it's not even out there\nBy leaving it out there doing him\nHarm because they have a use it as a focus for a while it was Russia everyday notice how they shut up about Russia and the cabin all thing suddenly became we've got to believe victims we have to believe survivors\nWe have to believe all women no matter what they say a woman that comes forward is believable and she must be treated with respect and dignity I met\nThis guy who's been a judge a federal judge for Thirty years and some of the highest courts in the lab we can't believe him but we can believe this woman nobody's heard of for thirty five years who by the way it goes to a psychiatrist every week and got her story from are hitting memory from the psychiatrist we got to believe her\nBecause she's a survivor now\nThat accused Bill Clinton and a dozen other Democrats in the last twenty or Thirty years those are just a bunch of lying horse ... the rest of the women that's a bimbo air rupture that's right the the the the Democrat women\nBelievable without question and you\nObviously stupid without question is what they believe because they keep telling you the\nCounting on it and will you just ... come November and prove them wrong\nAnd you said yourself but aren't they worry that I won't vote for them now because votes don't matter anymore we had an election they lost and now they're saying\nWell if we riot in the streets and we hit people with sticks and we attack their cars and we burn down their campuses and we riot all over the place and and dig our nails and our fingers into the doors at the Supreme Court scratching and clawing your way and to be heard the votes don't matter\nAnd you know they may be onto something I mean we encourage you to vote and and and make sure that you don't reward for Democrats for their deceitful and hateful ways but guess who owns the voting machine\nGeorge Soros yes if there was\nEver an opportunity [laughter] this is it all and\nGeorgia's company this was this beautiful Georgia's company who owns the voting machines not all of them by the way just quite a few of them has a new idea\nTo hold it together and be better than I was yesterday\nThis caller suggested\nTo me that it is time for people to rise up and fight back and it was clear to me\nHe wanted to strike out when are we going to be able to protect yourself well if you were in danger you have that right now if you or your family are under threat and field at your life is at stake you have that right\n\nThat's not what he was talking about\nI Want you to I Want you to really listen to me carefully fleas please with an open heart\nListen to me we can disagree and we can talk about it and I respect you if you disagree with police listen to my\nReasoning\nI have looked for an answer to this and I have most likely I was one of if not the first person in your life to tell you this was coming\n\nI believed that before I started to say it on the air and once I felt that way believe me it drove me to my knees to try to find an answer\n\nAnd nothing seems to work and I keep going back and saying that doesn't work\n\nAnd I keep getting the same answer and I keep looking at history\nDo not surrender\nDo not sit down do not comply\n\nWe need to go to the polls and we need to vote\nNow I Know people in this audience of rolling their eyes that doesn't change anything it has changed a lot\nAlready it has changed a lot\n\nIf you hadn't gone to the polls\nAnd frankly if you would have listened to me we wouldn't have had the two Supreme Court justices that we do you wouldn't have a president who stood up against the mob\nNow with that being said this president also with his tweets as you know throws gasoline on the fire sometimes and that's not helpful\n\nBut it feels good\nFeels good because people have been kicked to the curb for so long\nI cannot even watch CNN anymore I Can't I Can't I can barely watch any news anymore\n\nWe must stand for what our parents taught us was through what\nWe learned that was true\n\nAnd there's a lot of things unfortunately we have to start it sticks and stones can break my bones\nWhen I asked the guy how was your family under attack he told me well I you don't have to go to a grocery store if I were a flag on my shirt I get dirty looks dirty looks\n\nApart I Need you to hear I Need you to hear it very clearly first let me ask you this question is America good\nDo most Americans believe in fairness just being fair\n\nI think you ... I Hope you still answer yes but it seems to be getting smaller and I would agree with you on that but we have fought fire with fire and it's not changing any hearts\nIn fact it's doing the opposite is changing our heart\nWe are not getting stronger in our Judeo Christian values we are getting weaker we're getting more angry we are moving towards the edge of the best that others are wanting us\nTo walk off\nListen to this one explanation and you'll understand why I feel so desperate right now why did bon half or fail\nIf you don't know ... Dietrich von ... for is you should look him up he was a pacifist he had a lot in common with Gandhi except he believed in Jesus but that other than that I think that's the only real difference\nHe was a pacifist he was a pastor he was in Germany he walks\nThe street on crystal knock and went in to those stores with broken glass and bought things from those stores the very next day this guy did not sit down he was not quiet the day the fewer gave his inaugural address\nHis broadcast was shut off because while that was happening\nHe was giving a speech on radio called the ... principal he was speaking out to a nationwide audience this is wrong\n\nHe had influence he had power\nHe had position he was in the right place\nWhy was that voice not able\nTo convince his fellow Germans\nBecause they had already gone over the cliff\nBecause they had lost because of World War one and the Nineteen twenties they had lost their Judeo Christian values it was an empty shall there was nothing left other than the tradition of going\nNow I don't believe that that's where where are you yet but we're approaching that\nIf we lose our Judeo Christian hard our values our principles if we lose our art type as a nation that Jesus is who we should try to be\nWe're done\nAnd not only we done we become the darkest nation in the history of all mankind you think you were afraid of Google Now\nWait you think China is a mess wait if we go dark we could be responsible for\n\nOf Christ as our exemplar there I said it\n\nOf the the traditional view of\nHow we are to behave how are we how we are to act\nThere will be a time where fighting is [noise]\nThe only choice\nBut it's not now now is the time\nTo live the Judeo Christian values that made a marathon Mary I'm\nGoing to do was a big bucks or keep your see on ... radio\nAnd then ... ... ... [noise]\nYou're listening to Glenn Beck ... [noise]\nI Want you to I Want I Want you to understand that you are on a path to victory right now\nYou were on a path to victory\nIf you were angry this morning I understand I understand because you're watching TV or your reading things on social media and you're like I Can't believe these people are calling for for mobs or riots and there and the and the media is excusing them\nAnd it was a media winning\nLet me use only winning 'cause we're allowing them into our life when they're meaningless to me is not winning you are thinking of this\nYou got the most ... man in American history elected you got a guy that everyone said cannot do it the ultimate outsider doesn't play politics doesn't play game doesn't do anything that anyone would say you should do that\nYou got him elected\nThen what did he do\nUh started doing the things he said he would do\nWhat the hell is that I've never seen that from a politician\n\nYou're winning do you think the left has become unhinged because they think you're on the ropes\nDo you think the left has has just signed on to democratic socialism a radical on American idea\nDo you think that they're excusing add to far because they think we're about to win this is the last gasp in death throes\nBacked into a corner no place to go what do you do you're just starts throwing punches here a lot in the corner there in the corner where are you acting like you're in the corner\n\nThey are trying to get you to feel like you're in the corner here or not\nThey're not protesting because you're weak they're protesting because you're strong\nPeople will say I don't want to talk to the Democrats can't talk to the Democrats really really I'm not talking about the politicians I'm not talking about the crazy ... people on the edges I'm Talking about your neighbor\nNow a lot of people can't get that I Can't talk to a lot of people I get it I Do get it but let's not forget twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump motive for brown bomber\nWhere\nWhere are they coming from we don't want to talk to people who voted for Barack Obama really ... twenty\nPercent now you're not hearing that on\nTV because the Democrats and the media don't want you to know that fair twenty percent responsible for this more odd stir\n\nYour winning African American unemployment is the lowest\nIn history\nOur current unemployment rate overall is the lowest since the Nineteen sixties\nYou're winning\nYou have a conservative court and if things continue this way if we go out and vote a guess what you might have two other court appointments\n\nWhy do you think there'll be mad about that\nBecause you were saying\n\nLet's remember that and keep that into perspective when we call for violence now why why punch down we have a bigger vision for America and it's happening why punch down it's relevant\n[noise]\nIt's easy to get bad\nIt's easy to get mad especially in today's world it used to be that we had to be mad about something that was real now Americans are mad because oh my gosh did you hear they use the N word I actually had to click on the story 'cause I didn't know what the N. word\nWas the headline was a CNN hosts goes crazy because gas uses Edward what how is the N. word mob mob don't use that word now can't call and to fall or what's happening at the steps of the Supreme Court about no no no four hundred arrests that's not a mob\nShell who is probably the most\nTalented in the family she sent me oh we're working on our ginger bread you know house for contest ah you know again this year and they always you know when a ribbon and whatever and she's like a massive over ... so she said oh this year we're doing a wizard of Oz theme\nLike oh okay [noise]\nThe wizard of Oz she just showed me she just finished the witches house\nAnd she saw me and see it goes up here\nAnd she's making a gingerbread tornado and the house is sitting in the tornado it's raising it is like raising ... even begin to think about what that would look like a show it to yeah I mean I loved it posted I'll posted next to my volcano and you tell me which one sicker\nOkay I mean I miss my family is riddled with illness mental illness can't stop ... stop a but I'm healthy compared\nTo her this leads me to a bizarre question I Can't believe I'm asking an already but it's big gingerbread making a move here for an additional holiday have you noticed this lately\nI've noticed some Halloween gingerbread houses now gender bird houses are Chris ... right that you do the Christmas you may be Thanksgiving a high on them because we are yeah right\nYeah yeah yeah we have to Halloween gingerbread houses at our house I won't do it how did that START I won't do it what is being gingerbread trying to do yeah we're going to have this like July Fourth jammed her bread houses it they're red white and blue that damn\nRussian Austrians or whoever's behind that and you know that's a foreign influence definitely Russian Austin yeah there's there's so\nMany Russian Austria gingerbread saying that I write where I Am telling you literally where it's ... we we know about\nOn your right hand man that land and program\nI Want to thank and a denser he is he's a guy that we had books last hour and a kind of went in a different direction but I did it fits right in to what we had been talking about today I had a caller uh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back\nAnd\nWe should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth do not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we\nWere not at a place where I think he grabbed a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst heads stats are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books on outrage of a nice time and good talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nYou know it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime and rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded\nAnd mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges as Dan's response is I mean they just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of\nPeople feel right I Know you are a lot of\nBuilt up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center\nA well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nUh and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world like for you bringing that up to bring in that case up even today but it but I but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around\nThe world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because [laughter] and I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution\nUh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings\nThey're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation has faced their challenges\nBut this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats we observe new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated a outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path that I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed I think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is and the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables\nBut he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around to the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to get like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage\nIs to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know we don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight uh\nI find that time and the lights were on late at night last night at mercury one our mercury one partners are are are are ready to provide aid relief\nTo those who have are going to be affected it is now coming onshore alligator point Florida it is a monster a category for it I mean boy did this happen fast\nDangerous storm surge the when the flooding all in the north eastern Gulf Coast a and a lot of people didn't even get out to evacuate because it happened so fast we do have our hurricane relief fund up now we need your help donations\nOr will go directly where they are needed most if you donate directly to the disaster relief fund one hundred percent of the money raised goes to that effort so you can go to mercury one dot org slash hurricane relief\nMercury one slash hurricane relief that's mercury one dot org and please a help us so we can have everything that Florida might need there when it is time most likely later today [noise]\nAll right pat gray is a joining us from pat gray unleashed and a pat welcome thank you good to be here yeah it is and what is on your mind today\nDid you ever see the ... the TV show continuing did you watch the yeah I loved it yeah it was a great show yeah it was all about corporations running the world and the you're twenty Seventy\nOr something yeah and I you know what I thought it was kind of silly at the time I have mocked Blade Runner and everything yeah corporation ... come on all scared of corporations yeah the the that's the one thing the left had right\nThey might yeah they might have had it right in the right way right I mean that\nThey were not yeah ... voice bad right I think we are today is by the way I remember when they put the flag with all the corporate logos on it and everything else I always thought oh please give it a rest but it is I mean you could put Amazon Google Facebook on the flag and eh pretty accurate\nYeah we ... we ... we now have and those are some that you mentioned that we now have companies that are big enough to really fit fit that role I don't know that it that they do no not yet but uh Amazon in particular is just getting enormous and I'm In the book the for the hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google\nOr the author talks about just how massive Amazon is\nA for instance far fewer us households have a gun than Amazon Prime thirty percent of sixty four percent holding a more Americans have primed and voted in twenty sixteen only fifty five percent I'm more Americans have Amazon Prime then go to church\nA more have Amazon Prime than um than are in a monogamous relationship with a spouse\nShe'll have said that about more Americans had NBC and CBS and ABC I mean maybe\nBut they're into so many other things to which you know you've got to consider\nThat I'm a ... that they're they're into everything else like that I think it's fifty five percent of households now or sixty five percent of households have a Alexa ...\nAnd ... why do we invited that surveillance indoor home if they want to use it that way and I don't know that they are but they are they are recording they are recording\nThe gas yeah we're going to the newly yet because they they it needs to a listen but it's also learning it's trying to learn how to communicate\nYes and they're they're reporting on our moods our tastes all the things we like all the things we want the things we need and our fears and they just report all of that\nBack to a Amazon headquarters or they\nJust gobbled up whole foods right now and when they did kroger's stock went from thirty one dollars a share to twenty two\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty or they already sell more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and they're they're about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix\nOr they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] just so many things is it time to I mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capital is breaking up a company that's what they did that Microsoft is what they did to a or they try to to Microsoft that's what they did with mountain bell I'm\nMountain bill was in with the government", "year": "2018",
