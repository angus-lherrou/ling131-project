I suspect I ice strongly suspect\nUh George Soros or other sugar daddy with billions of dollars in their pockets to to burn\nThey said that over Twenty one thousand people have donated money to her several of written big checks including the basis for the Grateful Dead still lash who gave ten thousand himself a sucker\nAnyway [laughter] when when I hear she's got a deal for a book\nNow you know nobody's going to buy that book nobody cares about that book is not going to sell such Hillary Hillary comes out with these books and they gave her like millions of dollars in advance and then the book doesn't sell and the book a publisher eats all that yeah I don't think they eat it I think\nThey're getting funneled money from George Soros amount of money there aren't that book out there\nThey they'd be out of business by now if they've done this too many times\nBecause Hillary Clinton white for books they all lost money they're all losers and gas and and people like this woman here will come out with a book and nobody will buy it and it'll be on the bargain table within two weeks at one for the price it originally was and still they won't sell it\nWhen they originally set up these go fund me accounts [noise] it was to help pay her legal bills now her lawyers are representing her pro bono and the Democrat committee\nI like it when he says pro bono boating get bono the Democratic or you're just you're a\nCommittee there are paid for it but if she had no experience is we've got to get Trump yeah sick isn't this a messed\nUp world isn't it so so messed up and there's so little common sense but\nThe world of taking over for a left these their world doesn't have common sense and I mean because their world jai rates in around things like socialism which for over a hundred years has been tried in every country on the planet and doesn't have one single success story\nNot one that was a guy a try argued point with the college idiot the other day and one of these college appearances and they were talking about the fact that he said can you tell me what success story of communism and the guy was struggling\nOr Cuba got great education and they got\nRain healthcare and ... really you want to go there and you're talking about all the human rights violations and starving people in the whole nine yards and the and\nOne after another shooting down to the various examples and the millions of people that have been killed doing forests communism 'cause first thing you have to do when you install communism is kill all the people that dissent\nAnd believe me plenty will because it's not something you you do it willingly meant so all of us left or the people that are too scared to rock the boat\nAnd it's been that way throughout history and they cannot name a single but yeah and here we go Brazil and other fine example Brazil and what the opposite way of Venezuelans ... socialism by vote and they kept the voting that didn't turn dictatorship and then they had another vote said\nLet's go back to the other day and didn't work out like we'd been told it will deter you turned they've gone back\nTo the last couple of American style have free markets have companies that belong to the private sector have a gun ownership and freedom of speech yeah\nThe Trump on the tropics is now in charge of Brazil and what the other direction so you college kids are clear and present danger to everything we stand for with your your warped minds that you've cooked and what's really funny is those colleges billions of our\nTax dollars are gone on to the to subsidize these colleges that teach these kids that have struck this stuff to bring the nation down right they fun we have got to stop doing that I don't know who's going to stand up\nI think Trump standard so many directions now I Can't stand it anymore [laughter] he's like a spinning top but somebody's got to stand up to this stuff I don't know who's going to be you know\nOr maybe from an unlikely source good maybe from where you least expect it could be\nMaybe I'll be the guy who steps up and says stop sending your kids to college ain't doing them no dang good look at me and I'll be the the poster boy I'll be the superhero of uh of what can we college buster I'll tell you what I'll be at college buster\nI admire your enthusiasm why don't we discuss who's going to be that

You're welcome\n[laughter] All right\nThat's our homework assignment go home and talking about getting a T shirt with one and a little flat\nHats on it\nAnd I'm On draw circle around it will all on

kind of Indian that guy was sent those non bombs in the mail Filipino wasn't in Indian or some ... I don't remember\nDon't forget boys and girls this is our hero to eat it every day [noise]\nEight six six to eight seven to three eight eight eight six six to eight seven to three\nI'm Amy Aaron founder of Madison read here come the company I named after my daughter it's very meaningful to me when I hear customers talked about how to read them hair color has it changed their line here's one of our very first customers how during my own hair is easier than I ever imagined that part\nI no longer had to sit in front lawn and pay over a hundred dollars to hand darn now in ...\n\nHe had another suspicious package I'm Dave Anthony Fox News intercepted this morning in Atlanta address the CNN\nSo now they're complaining about the fact that their little movie got a a ... this this character removed from the show now they're complaining about it oh we just wanted him to be I mean basically what they're saying is no we don't want you to get rid of them we just wanted to write everything that he says\nWell I mean that's not something the Simpson signed on for yeah sorry\nTwice and I believe all raised and this is a great lesson for everyone who tries to please say making Kelly I think the same type of thing right you can't you can't no\nMatter what you say they're never going to be pleased the people who come after you for these in these nonsensical PC issues\nWill never be pleased no matter what you give them no matter what apologies say no matter how sincere it is no matter ... they're not asking you to remove up who they're not asking you to change they're asking for something that you can't possibly give them any earlier you realize that the better\n[noise]\nLet me change the subject to enough is enough\nWhen America will enough be enough\nNew polls Americans fed up crave for unity admitted violence now this one should terrify you\nBecause fifty seven percent now say they want a third party\nThey want unity that number is even higher\nBut I'm not sure people actually mean this\nI'm not sure what unity even means they say that we no longer really uh agree on the core values of our country which I think is actually true\nWe don't agree on core values but what are those core values\nAnybody know\nWhat are the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now\nWay things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied Thirteen percent are like a ... percentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen\nPercent Fifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our\nQuote the most important values politics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value race relations gap between rich and poor\nThe state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security with an exception\nOf a couple of those aren't values\nThose are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing see\nI I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted to outrage\nWe have a few things we have to decide we have to decide one so western world war it's saving\nIs freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want you just uh you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics\nWho can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are way sincerely which are we we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice as we're good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe've been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America and\nNot just in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important and\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for because if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on I I'm I\nWe cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our\nBasic essential values in line like climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth okay that's a value that's on climate change climate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem is there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion in ... in the scientific field\nYou gave me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled is shut up that's a violation of our values\n\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is co workers in this this collusion\nAnd that your your system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system and it doesn't work\n\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nAre the values we both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth\nAnd I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean up\nI'm sick of it don't tell me you care about the environment and then after a protest everything is not about litter\nYou either care about it or you don't words don't mean anything anymore only actions do don't tell me what you believe show me what you believe\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or\nPlaying golf for tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably the three week quick start from relief factor may be all you need the lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something\nYou need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick start\nNow only Nineteen Ninety five go on to order more [noise] let's see if we can get\nYou out of pain to go to release factor dot com [noise]\nSlang that [noise]\nBad country or a good country that's that's the question we have to ask now [noise] is the western\nWay of life we're saving is it good is it nothing but a bunch of ... gender males white males white Europeans that of oppressed people\nIs that is that all is that all it is\nCan I ask you do when do you think World War two officially started\nWhen did it really start start so not our involvement in it yeah not our involvement a God I mean the date I'm not going to get right I Know you just give me an event [noise]\nA [noise] a tough one\nUh would you say Germany invades Poland or you know breaks the treaty with you know I mean I'm sure you do to Chamberlain or ... I mean ...\nSo you're talking events that lead into other events send me that you could go in for a million different places and\nI'll give you I'll give you one how 'bout when Japan invaded China happened in thirty seven if you live on that side of the earth yeah you think World War two started then Japan invaded\nChina Manchuria they said the only problem was Manchuria is all the ... that sounds familiar a and so they invaded\nAnd they started up mass slaughter mass slaughter all of the you know the bad bombings of civilians that happened years before we were doing it or the Germans were doing it it had it started in thirty seven in China with the Japanese well where was the white man\nNow you know where the white man was you know how history reflects now America didn't say anything at the time America didn't step up to the plate and stop the slaughter in China\nSo wait a minute hold it just a second so are we supposed to get involved in everything or are we not supposed to be involved and everything when we get involved you blame us for getting involved in saying we're trying to jam our stuff down everybody's throat\nWhen we don't show up you you blame us for not showing up either way\nAccording to you we violated quote our values\nWhat our values\nWell our values used to be we our enemy of no one friend all\nNow that gets a little dicey gets really dicey didn't get dicey apparently when the Japanese invaded China\nYeah that's because they only care about Europe no actually no we couldn't fight on all of the friends we had to choose we didn't even want to go save Europe\nAmerican didn't even want to go into war\nWell how could you oh my gosh how could you ditch Europe [noise] wait a minute\nWe're supposed to go save the white patriarchy where ... wait a minute we are to blame for all of that because we didn't go in and save the white hierarchy I thought you just said that was bad and should be destroyed Mm\nIs America bad or good let's have that discussion I'm\nLot some smart in your smart speaker of looks like it'd be or see on our heart radio I'm\n\n\nA\nPlane like Glenn Beck man\nI Want to address the before we when we get off the air today there's so much to\nTalk about um we've got to talk about Twitter in what they're doing now 'cause it it brings it brings the point that I was just\nMaking home about what our values and what are the problems that we're trying to solve their different\nPeople are now saying that you know the problem is is that Americans don't agree on basic values and principles anymore well I agree with that but nobody even is talking about those when's the last time you heard anyone really talking about values or principles in the mainstream media\nTell me last time you heard that talked about on Fox for an CNN or MSNBC\nTell me\nDefending basic principles what are those principles well American principles we used to find self evident that all men are created equal\nSo you want to talk about the ah the the shooting\nIn I'm In er\nPittsburgh great\nThat guy has violated American principles all men are created equal an endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights one of those rights is religious their right to to pursue God the way\nThey pursue God\n\nNow how about the principal violated or by the bomber\nCrazy guy crazy guy wow\nAll men are created equal and end up by their creator with certain inalienable rights among these\nFreedom of speech freedom of expression\nFreedom of assembly freedom to petition your government well I don't like what those Democrats are saying I don't like what the media is saying but they have a right to say it\nSo do you target them for death no not if you want to talk about principles everything else\nIs about politics now we could talk about his mental health and that would be something else that would be a very valid target the topic we gotta talk about mental mental health in America Americans are feeling more and more alone more and more isolated communication is going through the roof\nBut none of those are principles\n\nDo we take care of one another well that's the golden\nRule isn't it that's the golden rule\nSee we we just assume that\nAnd we were awake for a while and I I'm not sure if we are as wake as we think we are now\nWe woke up and we we really um we really learned a I think under Barack Obama but now many of us have gone back to sleep because okay our aside is in charge and so they don't take care of it no no they won't that is the problem no they won't\nWe are the answer they are not the answer we are the answer\nAnd you're not going to learn this through osmosis\nFound an incredible thing happened to me my my son finally got into American history and I couldn't wait to get out okay he's got a full and there's going to be the easiest thing ever American history living in my house going into my speech is listening to me\nYou know helping me pack things up for a speech is

will get rid of it here and we'll keep working on it\nBecause people will finally see the light of day we don't want another war progressive don't you dare don't you dare condemn them when you won't

this week and can't wait to see what's going to be a an awful lot of fun as doing I where I'm working on the show on friday\nLet's just say I mean they could go one of two ways it could it it might spiral out of control and it just might spiral out of control or we go on\nA Thursday to Richmond, Virginia then on friday were up in Hershey, Pennsylvania a than a Saturday we're in Pittsburgh\nAnd there's some special things were going to be doing in Pittsburgh buy your ticket if you're anywhere in the area come to Pittsburgh uh I'm doing all of the proceeds uh to uh uh to\nThe Jewish community

sorry that is on a Sunday I don't usually do anything on a Sunday\nBut it was the only time a that we could uh that we could do it and put it in the schedule so Cleveland, Ohio on a Sunday\nBring your kids bring your friends [noise]\nBring a sense of humor\nAnd possibly a notebook there's also going to be some things that I think\nForce them to go early to get all the activists out and they can have them go and you know\nGo pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's an interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that is people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if the Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and six team\nSo two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nIn two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now uh we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states\nSo if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well ... three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate into two dozen sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve\nGot it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now there were Twenty one districts that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bottom on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nOr in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change so and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voting for Obama then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Obama\nWith Romney or the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these a district show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama been changed to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there was about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats and it was you know now that part of that it's it's a little bit different than what you would stay in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just they're popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think it's necessarily solely because of some switch like soldiers type of ... tell me what all this\nMeans from last week or the Democrats making is is the momentum started just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid and the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all of due to the shooting and the bombing\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you want real polling reaction that lethal today we have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the early okay I Will look for\nThe election by numbers on the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nThis weekend as you know a gunman opened fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh he shot and killed eleven people during Sabbath services injured six others for where police officers the guy was insane\nHated Donald Trump that doesn't make him a Democrat\nDoesn't mean that he was you know following I don't know Cory Booker whoever it just means there's just not political\nAnd should it be and we keep jumping to politics first\n\nI Can't imagine what these families are going through Pennsylvania has taught us before with the Amish how to deal with killers\n\n[noise] if you've been listening to me um for a long time you know what I Believe is coming and have said is coming for a while and I'm always wrong with timing\nBut I don't think there's any way to deny that what I've worn was coming is here now we're seeing the beginnings of it now\n\nAnd it's only going to get worse and it's going to get harder it's going to get harder for you to stand up\nHave they taken gab down yet I think the\n... the service provider for them has taken them down um I don't know if they're back up and it's not cabs fault gathered that it's a kind of a shorter\nCompetitor I guess I Would say that they found up are becoming a safe haven for anti Semite so I guess and and and you know I don't want that nobody wants that but\nWe either believe in freedom or we don't and yes I don't I don't like the poison that they put out\n\nBut I also don't like the silencing of voices this America man this is American principles you can't\nIt's like to eat it over the weekend\nI'm so sick of those who want to blame this president for everything he didn't express sympathy or expressed it fast enough to stop it there's a deep sickness taking root in this country and it's spread here Twitter has become the white van covered indispensable bumper stickers\nI'm listening to some of the responses the deep sickness stems from a man who mock sending flames hatred and bigotry is not the root cause but he's fanning the flames yeah caffeine\nOr you two are you doing that as well is CNN is is anybody else in the media doing that is Twitter fanning the flames\nUh watches rallies and tell me how he leads us into a unified a nation I tell you what Allison in Kentucky I'm going to take her in a minute she was just that one of his rallies uh let's see oh Glenn are you going to do an anti Semitic attack on George Soros and I\nKnow how many have you done over the years none probably too many of the couch it no none but oh yeah right Twitter is the problem will seem like it is because you don't have the facts\nAnd all you're doing is you are being a blowhard without any\nFacts I'm not anti Semitic ... how how\nHow center of Israel award for attention by the prime minister of heat\nOf George Soros was paying for a anti uh Glenn Beck protesters while I was doing a defensive Israel a program in Israel I mean I'm not anti Semitic I'm I point out the facts of what George Soros has used his money\nAh oh really really Glenn then now you're saying that he's paid for the caravan no I didn't say that he paid the pay some of the money\nFor the last caravan but I don't have anything on this caravan but let's just look at the facts\nDo most of the electorate or gave you are seeing on your radio\nLegendary raped me apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and\nIt's in computer game and New York times best selling author AJ Jay Gould about how we are all family like it or not to judge\nJudy effect I always hated her then I found out through DNA I'm her like fix says it actually made me switch my perspective I'm like oh cousin\n\nGlad that probably in the living or hear like you Allison in Kentucky thanks for holding you're on the Glenn Beck program [noise]\nGood morning Glenn it's so difficult to hear you struggling this morning going maybe I can give you an some of the long time listeners some advice\nOkay I'm not really well\n[laughter] I like I've been a subscriber to this networks ... TV we hearing voice when you're struggling a bit more than ... than usual okay yeah my my my advice is make it tangible because there's so many of us that tune in every day and and listening to this broadcast but then we don't make a tangible\nAnd even you were saying that you haven't been doing your shows you haven't been out of the road for a while I think it's going to be so good for you because you need to connect with the people you have to agree my friend and I\nGenerally of I had a a friend of mine that's a Vietnam veteran in his seventies and we went all the way we live in Ashland, Kentucky we got up at two AM stroke six hours to Illinois for it that the Trump rally this weekend on Saturday now\nAnd and then stood for eleven hours straight because we were told the first two thousand people in line would get into the hangar\nAnd we knew we were going to get that way and and as it got through security and looking at George saying oh I Can't wait to sit down and you get to the hanger and there were no states so there's a reality of we're going to be standing another six hours on concrete\nSo what we're saying is this president is a lawyer [laughter] I'm Sorry I just play that just playing the Brazilian go ahead tell us or\nI could say it as much as they want you know what we were standing in line making fun of the Carbondale a solidarity network which was a socialist group that was coming to protest they had to have their eleven AM pancake\nBreakfast before they came to protest and you know we we were joking well do you think there were a vegan and gluten free options to go along with that and right but there were over ten thousand people there for the rally and less than Seventy five people showed up to protest\nThere was not a piece of how would you say this about your ... function is when you've had the restoring functions there was no garbage we would never know when there was ten thousand people there you know one was complaining\nI was I I kind of had to warm up to Trump myself and I was a tendency to go to one of these things because I was afraid if I said one negative thing I was going to be completely shouted down no people were so open about talking and\nYou know someone had to go to the bathroom and into their child stayed with us I mean you're in a group of ten thousand people you trust strangers to watch your child while while you may run and do an errand a comeback real quick it was it was such a positive environment\nAnd you know it's like a president just happened to show up [laughter] it was I and I'm so glad he's actually going to be in Huntington on friday which has five miles away from where I live I'm so glad I went to Illinois\nBecause I remember standing in line and seeing the the headline break about the shooting mhm and wait we also went through the doubt whether the president was going to show up or not\nAnd this is after we got in the hangar standing there for two hours but we never gave up hope\nAnd we were we we all know we had jokes of you know conservatives the one thing liberals can do better than us is chant we can't can't as many classes or something\nI Know we saw it and I'm really glad we saw [laughter]\nBut you know it's it was such a positive environment and our legs were or just killing us by the time that he got there and George not drove back that night it was at twenty eight our\nRoad trip that we took for this experience and as exhausted as we were in as much as we were a gang George looks at me and says he's doing one in Missouri later this week is and how far is that well that was that what it was just six hours Missouri was going to be eight but we were going to\nGo until we found out that this one was going to happen right across the river on friday so fine like it tangible ... that's the best I can say it is go and meet these other people tend to Seventy five\n... ... were very quiet people but we do cut to this rally and there there was just an energy that was there that you realized we can be ... there's\nHope for society yeah granted I got up and went to Walmart the next morning and people are cutting you off to get to the best parking spot and you're like well yup on how\nAlison ain't got the second I Want to get your copy of my book I I signed it I'll send it up to you thank you so much for holding him thanks for I'm I'm sharing that it is that that is but maybe if I might struggling today\nDo feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to damn I'm a little frustrated at er at the new nation I Would say that and I will I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what you're saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nI'm being an anti Semite chief his daughter is Jewish\nThe you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any relatively few", "show_name": "The Glenn
