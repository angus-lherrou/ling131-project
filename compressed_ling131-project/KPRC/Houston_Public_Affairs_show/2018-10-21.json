Herrera and he was a lawyer here in town and I'm Thurgood Marshall ended up of course on the Supreme Court but before that\nHe was an N. double ACP lawyer and he fought a lot of civil rights law suits\n[laughter] John J. Herrera did the same thing uh but for Hispanic civil rights I'm he fought for better voting access he fought for employment issues he fought because a Mexican Americans were not being allowed to serve on juries\nAnd so John J. Herrera was doing that same kind of litigation and he's up there and it was people like him that solve the problem when he saw stories of cardio Garcia and and similar stories a and did something about it\nSo you can go see this mural is not only commemorative of this culture and our history but it's so new or reason to go to discover their heritage society once again there downtown which is really easy access but it's one of those places you can just walk around and take a look at it without spending a dime that we hope that you go see the museum obviously\nYeah it's the technical addresses eleven hundred back the um the museum is between Dallas and Lamar on bag we saw the very west edge of downtown it's in Sam Houston park all the houses are there and are these are the original houses most of them are still built with the original material they were wrapped in Louisiana\nAnd a in a city where we sometimes talk about the zoning and this kind of\nLook back on on the functional architecture of the time because a lot of these houses weren't built\nTo be very pretty they were built to withstand the weather and shelter families it was very or is it was a very functional and maybe poor way of building at\nA house where the houses they're run the gamut we have a one that's called forth war cottage that came out of frequents down there's actually two houses that were put together um one very much in a a French Louisiana that\nSouth Louisiana Cajun architecture and one is just a regular little square house they joined them together to create a house or that probably dates back to maybe the Eighteen forties\n... in the Eighteen fifties in the Eighteen forties Eighteen fifty this somehow lifted half of the house and and pushed it up against another one they put them on a law that rolled and are hooked up a mule 'em and\nDragged along and some of the houses and school houses in particular that I have studied\nRemoved a relatively long distance that way you would just move on from the back and put it under the front slow progress I think it works yeah it'll work\nYeah it works if you have the will and that's something else that I admire of being French I can tell you that the Texans infringe have something in common and that is the pride in their own history and there are stubborn confidence that there are right about just about everything about where it and that is true ... [laughter]\nI ... as one of the reasons why I Love being bicultural I feel like a French in Texas and not only are they history intertwined in a real way\nBut there's something similar in there and they're kinda stubborn ways of doing the work and building extraordinary things where they don't have any right to exist for instance the port of Houston I mean it's just it's extraordinary how far from the actual bay we are\nAnd how this has turned into the fourth largest port in in the country anyway so go see their heritage society there are online at heritage society dot org\nAnd they have a Gallic coming up on the twenty six is the ... gallery they're trying to bring back this festival this water festival hopefully eventually will there'll be a parade on buffalo by you\nAs supernatural creatures with much of our contemporary\nHalloween tradition seem to be reflected in this ancient\nCeltic holiday called silent [noise]\nThe truth is we know very little about ... but what we do know is that they're bonfires drew one familiar icon\n[noise] the bat\nAnd older times people have bonfires on Halloween whiskey has attracted to the bonfire and fact check to the mosquitoes and probably the al ... [noise] I'm safe you'd see them flying over the Halloween bonfire snake became associated with a holiday [noise] how did these\nAncient traditions survive into our modern era they were preserved by the Catholic Church\nBy the seventh century\nThe Catholic Church had spread throughout most of Europe missionaries including St Patrick who would become the patron saint of Ireland has successfully converted the pagan ...\nThe church it found that conversion was far more successful when attempts were made to offer clear alternatives to existing calendar celebrations\nThan simply stamping them out it was a tactic used under pope Gregory the first to convert more pagan\nSays if you should come across a group of people worshipping a trade to rather\nThan cut the tree down and tell them that they were ignorant and error to instead concentrated to Christ and tell them to keep meeting as they were accustomed to meeting at the same spot\nA key pagan festival destined to get a Catholic make over was little Maria a Roman festival of the dead on may thirteenth where they performed rights to exercise the malevolent and fearful ghosts from their graves ears Brown University professor of\nRoman history Nikola [noise]\nAll the different days that they have in the Roman calendar to celebrate the dead it was the spooky cell phone and then more yeah ... ... the departed would come up and\nChurch co opted Maria in six oh nine turning may thirteenth into what they called all saints day also known as all Hallows day\nThe word hello being equivalent to St\nAll Hallows day on are the most holy of debt Catholics those scenes to attain heaven\nAll Hallows day was such a success that church leaders made a decision to drain the life out of style and\nSo they moved all Hallows day from may thirteenth to November first\nBecause of this move people started calling Sal when all Hallows eve name because it was the evening before all Hallows day\nIn this quickly shortened into all Hallows eve and finally into Halloween [noise]\nAnd when we come back more on the story of how Halloween came to be this is our American story [noise]\nThis is Lee Habib with our American stories and
