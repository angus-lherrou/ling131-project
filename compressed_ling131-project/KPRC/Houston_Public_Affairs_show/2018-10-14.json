{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Who want to come in and participate in the program you we've talked about them coming in and teaching what other ways are there to serve the organization if you don't want to teach I mean not everybody is a public speaker of\nAbout once a month we have a prison event I'm On the inside and it might be like shark tank where the guys will stand up and deliver their business pitch and yeah volunteers will sit on a panel and just we have a lady that uh\nComes in and teachers are um produce Smith etiquette proper etiquette social dining situations as she is this dynamo this oh Ninety pound diminutive giant\nGuys not fear of women are often like dad likes to face it\nYou know she's been doing that for well over ten years going etiquette in prison and you know and so the guys get a chance to practice everything after they went through her book and went through the lessons with her and we'll bring volunteers who get to sit down and have lunch with them in prison with the\nProper plastic where an and holding out of the terrorists the ladies and passing the rolls the proper way using the proper plastic ... and just everything that they've just learn they get to practice\nYou know we're we've come back to teaching convicts something which my parents taught me and uh again I think that we live in a society which really overlooks the importance of parenting\nAnd uh when we can change that to uh the final thing that I Want to do on the show this was actually Brian suggestion or it's been very clear that Sam ... spent some time in prison a blind that too\nAnd uh it was your suggestion to to first have the audience listen to this well spoken and intelligent man and then dropping the news that you are a convicted felon because you actually kill somebody\nAt the ... yeah I'm not only the c._e._o. of TV I'm also a graduate ... I went through the program about four years ago and was released in two thousand fourteen so I've only been out of prison about four years having done nearly twenty two\nYou've done twenty two years in jail so he spent most of your life in jail isn't that about accurate\nI liked the math on that I'm actually fifty to it so it it was a significant a part of that\nUh you know everything that I learned in P. P. is empowered me to be where I'm at today I was a terrible employee a\nBoy you're a terrible person apparently you know we thought that was an addict I couldn't be trusted\nAnd I couldn't hold down a job I was living to party parted live I got caught up into the kind of\nCocaine cocaine night scene in Dallas and the late eighties and early nineties in my life just spun out of control to the point where I took a man's life and uh do deal that went horribly wrong\nI'm an ... you just put a a time span has basically I can say that I think that my American Life us spent all but three of my American Life in prison so that puts a perspective for me if I look back at my existence and I think my American Life if I imagine that have been spent in prison [noise]\nUm how how's your conscience that and maybe this is the question that how do you guys are you able to forgive yourself I don't know society is supposed to that's that's kind of a philosophical question but\nWe have a system where you get punished and it is supposedly impartial and then when you pay your debt theoretically you're supposed to be re entering society and do exactly what you two are doing but how is your conscience\nEarly on in my car Suresh and that was my biggest hurdle or I you know I felt like a piece of trash for what I'd done and I didn't really feel like I'm I even um earned the right to live a un I knew that prison or was the\nMinimal answer um so I I got over that by a fostering a relationship with a a but then I realize I had been part of the problem I no longer want to be a part of the problem I Want to be a part of the solution so I went back to school uh I\nEarned a degree I became a college tutor I became a para educator on the inside I'm In the fullness of time having just cleared the twenty year mark\nI met with a pro commissioner my thirteenth time up for rural I've been denied twelve times and and he um he basically told me that I was going to make ... going to give me another chance and\nI responded by asking him will you wait until next year\nReally and he said excuse me or you're asking me to stay in prison for another year and I said well I'm asking to go through the prison entrepreneurship program because I think that will empower me to really make a difference and and so I Would like to go through that so he gave me exactly what I asked for another year in prison and extreme ... and it goes through BP\nTo get an education is pretty brave\nYou know it wasn't the education with BP is phenomenal but you know that would want to get out of prison yeah for yeah I get that I understand that and I believe me I wanted to get out too but the network and the opportunity\nThat you get from BP is probably as good or better than the network that you get when you leave grad school and so you just don't get an opportunity like that and I recognize what that opportunity was and so uh it was by far the best chance for me to get out and make the biggest impact and that has played out perfectly\nThis gives you some street cred so to speak I mean Sam you're on the same position you can just say hey wait a minute I\nI I Walk the walk going through the program and everything I'm In my past I sold\nSold poison for profit I was a bad person you know I'm I've probably destroyed live so for me just being a quote unquote productive member of society just being me you know I got a great family a beautiful girl friend daughters um I couldn't I couldn't be better right now\nAnd you're paying taxes and your obeying the law yes taxes you're employing why shouldn't I Yes sir Yes sir see that and then it every time I can it's it's\nA it's kind of revolving door as in\nYou know whenever I first got out you know there was ... brothers that'll been out for a while they started their businesses and they needed help you know what I was there I needed the money you know and so I help them with their businesses and vice versa so I ... the guys that are just coming out all the time\nUm and put a little gas in their pocket and and you know it's just a revolving yeah\nWell I mean once again I think that these are important numbers the recidivism rate among the graduates of the prison entrepreneurship program is less than ten percent it's about seven percent\nOr if or a convict is released without going through the program the recidivism rate is expected to be at least fifty percent went out to lie they all most of the half of them are coming back\nNow because they've hurt somebody else or stolen from someone else it just seems to me that the evidence is that the program as absolute six up to be successful and if you can replicate it and grow it\nWill turn out prison into\nIs it is it acceptable to call them punishments slash educational what would be the the best way to consider prison because there is a there is a measure of punishment which is necessary for humans human nature to deal with the\nThe educational side of prison is so lacking and you guys are boats standing here as evidence that it's too bad because it would work\nIt seems like it would work on most of the ... some guys are in there for life and or they're locked away sure not everybody's ready right\nAnd you're not forcing people to get in either you know wrangling them it's entirely voluntary they're sending out postcards to gauge the interest that people like Sam who answer it just seems like the system is a ... it's an experiment in a way that is successful man so\nYou know it's amazing to see our our new participants come to the unit and um their first few days if they shake your hand they won't look and you are because they're so broken and spilled out and shame of who they are and that same guy nine months later at our business plan competition will give a\nTen minute business presentation\nThat will include his product or service offering his industry has competitors his differentiation a three year financial forecasts he will even include\nPhilanthropies around he'll probably use your name [laughter] while he's working the room and he just met you and seeing that confidence and confidence in that man in the course of nine months\nIs incredible his just went through nine months of college level many MBA\nSchool and it is empowered him to have a better vision for his future\nYou can participate by going to P. E. P. dot org that stands for prison entrepreneurship program P. E.
