I I started the show by saying that I was so impressed by the city of Houston which is not known as an artistic city\nAnywhere in the world I've ever been\nAnd it should be it really ought to be a I Wonder I think after Harvey and the ... and the tragedy and and the hope and beauty you actually saw come out of the community as\nDire as time uh I think that it kind of put the city on the map I've seen a lot of several articles about how good the food is in town and they are going to have a ton of food at the festival\nI'm going to say this again is a French guy who is not a snob I Love I Love a cheeseburger I Love a cheeseburger gonna be okay you can't make me happier than that but I also like above the book and you know it makes me just as happy you have that choice at the festival you can get your corn dog or you can get something more sophisticated\nTo your liking ... I Know that the idea I think that people have the idea you go to the by your city art festival\nDowntown to see art but uh you're going to eat and you're going to want to have a few drinks and actually my mom and I went for that reason knowing how big that part of the insulation would be in the art was almost a secondary we we knew we were going to love that right well we were kind of hoping for the food is it's\nOf the music too and and we've really gone um we've gone further and further in creating a family's home and a children's creative zone where kids could sit down and do different interactive art things than actually produce something that they can take with them\nAnd there are several options for them to do that and the U. of H. clear lake I'm a program that we talked about they actually put on one of the major\nThings there it's like art gallery from the University of Houston\nCorrect so we've we've got you know they put on one of the interactive events for kids so um and I think the Halloween costume contest is you know just adds a new a new thing for people to participate in the ground level and know this for summer doing that\nWhy why not it's kind of such an odd it you're just before I let me write that one yeah just to try it see what happens I I'm I'm actually surprised that it didn't exist before gotcha\nBut so you're going to try it out you're actually going to give a prize out to the most creative costume and the scariest thing\nOr most creative and best invest so you know a will will determine how that is we've got prizes for kids and adults and in both of those categories and that Sunday at two o'clock\nThere are also going to have the rock and roll mariachi is walking around and if that sounds awesome to you than you and I have a like mind [laughter] I Would go just to hear them honestly just to find out how cool that probably is\nAre we want to say again parking is not going to be a problem this is often a problem you have to go downtown or you go to a ball ball game and parking even though they have parking as I\nSaid they've fixed this up so that it is not a problem they've even thought of having a round up point for the car services you know if you're using an app to get to the show and if you're going to be having a few drinks that's a great idea a\nHigher car sure be responsible yet another option for hiking again park is going to be really easy that parking lot downtown to reopen since the flood mhm ah so I Know maybe some people remember last year we have a little more difficult right off the case right think the family right but\nThere's also a a we're part one of our one of our promotional partners issues to be cycle and for people that use that program there probably aware that right at city hall\nThere's a there's a huge a bank of the cycle points\nI don't know if he people everybody know that is these are these are banks radical share yeah yeah they're literally locked up\nTo an electronic bike rack you swipe your credit card you unlock the bike you pay for the time you use it you return it to another bank on the other side of town\nYeah so that's oh they're growing up but they have a huge bank and they're going to be their representatives from you should be cycle will be there I'm\nAlso they're showing their wares inning yeah sure just wearing is right you know so you're not going to be allowing people to ride bicycles on the ground so they wouldn't be policies not inside no no I Would ride my bike to the festival do that's easy enough\nFor anybody right it's actually a nice ride down a buffalo by you and we will have\nPlenty of places for people to a parking lots of bikes up if they make that choice I'm a bicyclist to yeah I ah I tend to do it we can mornings when there's less traffic but you know our um\nOur by you system the growing for bicycling is great so yes fan yeah I'm a huge fan yeah so people that want to bicycle we make it very easy for them to do that as well um and again he used to be cycle is a promotional partner with us on the ...\nAnd they're not sponsoring you but they are part of all every one of these events and I want to give a shout out to the Houston police department because this is another opportunity actually there's going to be police officers all over the ground there working\nBut they're generally in a good mood what an awesome opportunity to go talk I we we had a really long conversation with a police officer who was showing all his gear to to some of the kids they had I think I think it was completely\nYou know circumstantial the guy was just there and being nice and the kids and they became interested but uh you're you're doing this and association with the city and I guess the the the fire department is on notice to\nUh [laughter] I Hope we don't need that kind of wild out and I and I think all city\nDepartments are are aware of all major events are going on around town so\nYou know see how the cops is why I say it because you're a lot of times\nMan we know I often most of the time especially in the media they don't get a fair share and they deserve it because let's face it the vast majority of them do their job well the evidence is pretty clear on that\nAnd this is an opportunity but you know you're going to find a bunch of like minded people when you go to an arts festival like this and uh it's it's going to be open all day long\nOctober thirteenth fourteenth by your city arts festival downtown you're following that up with the ... city arts festival memorial park in March\nRight you're taken application from the artists who might want to participate\nYes that could go to our website and apply right now\nOr you can also donate to the organization\nA but keep in mind that when you go to the festival to support the festival itself is also to put some money back into the community and not just the arts community as we mentioned they picked six organization which you're going to be the main beneficiaries of this particular event in October\nThe calls to give us pause fresh arch recipe for success the arc of greater Houston museum of fine arts Houston and the University of Houston's clearly are galleries so uh it it it yeah I guess I Do a lot of talk on this show about how the arts or sometimes set\nAside and the thing that this community has been particularly good at bringing them back and ah if you're not all that into that you can still go to the festival we'll have a good time and an extra support other organizations um\nAnd ... said well just for about ... you can go next so we ran up the stairs washed his face and\nHe came back down and they were halfway down the block laughing and running away from him and he screamed out please I Want to go please I Want to go when they never came back\n\nHe actually got his first last night is known he was still hungry after dinner and told his mother that he'd light on the kind of more food and she said well you have said mission and he said I didn't even have any\nFamily everybody laugh but she known and Matt Baton Rouge lifted and he never forgot and kind of meant the recipe and fly and trying to get that good\nTried to figure out what a relief to try to figure out some way to\nFor the job go get a funny going to break up with you I Want to have you er [noise]\nI mean many times when he would get laughter from the audience was the closest one feeling you could compare to my [noise]\nAt the age of Fifteen Rodney Dangerfield began writing jokes when
