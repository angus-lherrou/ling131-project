reports that has been turning people's\nNumber to all sorts of strange colors which is also what happened with a burger with a black on a few years ago will nightmare king join in on that legacy of making your prove all sorts of scary [laughter] well we'll all know soon enough green poop green booth is something people just love talking about on social media for some weird reason\nDo from different studies in the past we know that foods can affect dreams and sleep quality and now we're going to be looking at specific makes use of proteins that can actually disruptive person's weight and possibly induced a nightmare\nSo basically what we're doing tonight at the office I'm not good for you we're going to be put in a couple of electrodes on your head and we're going to check for electrical brain activity and we're going to determine if you have nightmares or not [noise]\nWe drink [noise]\nSo right here you can see this subjects brain activity is picking up and did so is their heart rate which made its way to nightmare [noise] I remember hearing\nVoices and people walking around talking when I Would wake up I think I didn't hear the voices someone\nIn my dream turned into the burger the burger then transformed into the Europeans snake\nBesides waking up train route was once at all because of the cables they didn't bother me in the world swimming and uh I remember I saw\nA ... coming up a little water and those are trying to attack this little ... a clinical study\nProves that the nightmare king increases or changes of having nightmares by three points by tight [noise]\nKing nightmare king or in time for Halloween can not only affect the color of your number two but also affect the quality of your dreams making it three more times as likely be have nightmares I Can't imagine\nI Would ever sign up for nightmares\nI don't know if I make myself a guinea pig and that just because it gets sleep it's so hard to come by nightmares or to not the fun kind of scary [noise]\nActually to be honest with you though I haven't had a nightmare and a very long time trying to remember the last one I had oh man [noise] so [noise]\nThey don't qualify as a nightmare but\nThere was a ... do you um are you are you on to like those self hypnosis apps stuff like that [noise]\nI don't know if they ever you know actually do the stuff that they're going to say that they help you do I wouldn't count too heavily on 'em but just me you know the whole you know this hypnosis I can make you a better person or make you quit smoking or whatever but um one thing I found was\nThere was a couple of them that really helped me knock out on planes doesn't matter how hard I Try and relax on a plane I Can't sleep but I found that with a couple of hypnosis apps\nThat basically just go hey you're getting sleepy count backwards from whatever the hell numbered as a as I could wake up on the other end which was actually kind of cool when I was flying a lot\nIt was really really helpful I was flying a lot not getting a chance to sleep regularly because of work and things of that nature so the fact that it helped me get a little bit of rest on planes these hypnosis apps I really liked and there was this one company called uh she was mind defy mind if maybe that was a company that\nI haven't used them in a while but this was a company that I I got 'em all from and they're all completely reliable but then I noticed when the company came out with a couple of the new ones there was a twist at the end of a I guess it was meant to be healthy thing but they said hey and you know tonight\nTonight after you go to bed early in the morning after you've gotten all this really great sleep that you're going to get because you're going to sleep better as a person in general you're going to have venting dreams and\nDarned if they didn't change the quality of my dreams these hypnosis apps and I I stopped listening to him because a vending dream I guess there's maybe where you let go of a lot of stuff I don't know if this is a term that exist maybe you're a medical practitioner you know something about it maybe it was just something that the people at the hypnosis\nThe app company came up with but I Will start going like oh my God [laughter] every single time I listen to one of these things is that I Would have vending dreams and I don't know it wasn't really something that I Would sign up for voluntarily so I might give the nightmare inducing Burger King sandwich\nAnd a big old ... you try to get back to me [noise] let me know how that works out for you [noise]\n[noise]\nA great way to get over break up according to doctors is to have sex with your ex yeah apparently the best way to get over someone after a breakup is to get back on top of them and then perhaps underneath them and then side by side with them and maybe on top of him again for good measure because believe it or not according to a new study\nOut of Wayne State University in Detroit the doctors they're determined that one of the best way to get over your access by getting a town with him one last\nThe researchers say that people who did that with ... after a break up were less likely to be depressed and felt better overall on a day to day basis why will they say that having that final her on one more time actually gives you a real sense of closure which can help you start to move on and and now you know\nMcCotter's did okay and the ratings account or is it okay and the ratings on Tuesday night at average ten point six million viewers\nAlthough that number might climb a bit wants TV aren't delayed viewing are factored in there a couple of ways to look at that on one hand it was exactly where Roseanne left off this past spring when ten point six million people watch the season finale on may twenty second but it was down from last season's premier\nWhich attracted sixteen point six Eighteen point four million viewers now so it might say that it's down because Roseanne Barr and on the show any more\nBut it's hard to make the direct correlation because last season it was coming back after having been off the air for twenty Twenty one years and there is tremendous anticipation rabbit and this season it was coming back after being off the air for five months of the big question is now that the hype and curiosity factor has gone will the ratings settle in\nAnd whatever that number is it'll be hard to say whether or not it would have been better with or without resent speaking of watching things and onto than viewing and all of the above your here's a story I promised we'd get two for whatever reason people are tweeting\nAbout all the things today's kids are missing out on by growing up in the Netflix they're here some of the

you guys to call us up if you want a pair of them\nBut you have to say something interesting about voter fraud or anything you want and it doesn't have to be about voter fraud I mean this is this is a pretty laid back radio show what's a what's let's jump through some of these phone calls right now oh by the way here's the headliners puddle of mud distracts dirty hajj\nShip vow a grape and I've always I've ... loves develop forever oh that's fantastic wind up on that forever they've only been together since the two thousand but I've been a fan for a while point is this Dave in Rosenberg what up broke hey what are you doing\nDoing really well man I Love that it's friday and a man it's always fun to have standard Peterson and you guys calling in here with me while I Do the show\nOr a kitty I Want to know you think about the guy who was caught pulling up crews sign from somebody yard\nOkay I have a lot to say about this and some of it I Can't say on the air so have I have I told you this Sandra now I Know who the guy is oh I but I Can't I Can't out um here's why first of all the shouldn't we tried to find out what I ... I tried to contact crime stoppers about that mhm here's here's the whole story so here's what ... Davis talking about\nEarlier this week this video surfaced on line from the ... from the Montrose museum district area\nAnd the video essentially is this guy with yellow denim jeans and a black leather jacket and a creepy porn moustache long scraggly greasy hair\nAnd he was walking around ripping off Ted Cruz yard signs and during that happens you have the audio handy ... can you fired off real quick this\nBut I don't play that just hang on I I just want that one drop or he sounds like me go let me see if I have it yeah I had it right here it's okay I got to turn my computer on here's the soundbite it sounds like\nThat [noise]\n\nProbably to the point is this is like so many antifa oppose or want to be I mean not oppose reads legitimately trying to keep a and I think that I think most people listening understand what they asking about this is the guy who is wrapping up for his yard signs for somebody\nAnd they sent me this guy's social media account information about um what are you living um information about his uh his background of his education where he's been where he's grown up I Know everything about the guy I've got photos of him so I contact the police of the information that I have ... as a journalist and a reporter here KPMG I Can't go public\nI cannot it it it's kind of reckless just posted online I yeah I had a conversation with management about it\nAnd so I contacted the police about it and I'm not sure that there's a police report\nThat was filed against this guy I think it's just a video that went viral and somebody who made the video was like wow they ripped up my yard signs I don't know what to do about that um but I don't know there could be more to this ... ... it's in the HPD's hands now hopefully they do the right thing but hey since you asked what do you think about that\nWell you know the thing is for me it's like I uh I've got some friends on Facebook we're talking about this in surge in the state of the science and they're just the invader signed everywhere and they're not seen a lot of Ted Cruz sign\nWhy and why do you think that is that it will be [laughter] if it was not a threat I don't want to if I\nPulled out of the yard or or worse I mean during the Trump campaign there were people actually driving your ... yard\nRun by the over you know\nThat's exactly right David Neal that people don't want someone to smear feces on their front door or to follow their daughter to school\nPeople don't this is what they do I have a whole file here this is the first amendment friday so I haven't been playing a lot of sound bites the show\nBut I have a whole folder here of soundbites this week of high ranking liberal thought leaders either encouraging violence against a conservatives are actually doing it one of them was comedian George Lopez attacking a Trump supporter at a at a at a Hooters\nNancy Pelosi calling for collateral damage against conservatives I'm Tim Kaine telling people to fight in the streets we all remember what Maxine\nWaters said and don't forget Louis Farrakhan comparing Jews to termites like this is par for the course for leftist right now so Dave is absolutely right about that this is the reason why you don't see more of a people don't want to somebody to smear duty all over their front door or ... or or violently assault their wife or she's unloading groceries\nAnd we don't even want to be bothered when we were walking around her own neighborhood\nI that's what I call give you a kudos for for knowing that guy was a much not ... not because I've seen a couple of months\nYou know a lot of stories that lady of going a nine year old girl with the actual game with a guy again for your people may or may not disagree with the media to walk a good name and information out there by the time they get all that stuff you know they need to be a little more responsible\nOn how they relate information and I heard you on a radio that you weren't going to put it on the rise of the marriage but he said that\nThanks Jon I appreciate you saying that you know it's it's this is something that people on the left do a lot in the southern social justice warriors do and I figure there's other ways to retaliate so the first thing I did is I went to look up if there was a police report already filed about it and there wasn't\nAnd then I thought well this kind of puts a sort of situation here we can't we can't we can't tip off crime stoppers about a police report so then I reached out to the guy and I asked him if you'd like to be a guest on my radio show and believe it or not he hasn't gotten back to me you mentioned John what do you do over there man you you live over here work over here in the gallery of\nArt work over there and got a ... a man on the radio or my girlfriend and I but I'm working at a cage do you go to their new film studio ... workers work in the studio\nYou know what we should do do you know what to do you know what the Chinese

discussion between ... effects that developed in a negative way and led to a fight and coral the brawl aggravated to lead to his death and their attempt to conceal uncover what happened\nWhen I was in my twenties or my teens it was empty my teenage years to it I went to too many funerals for people who die from that I won't get into the specifics but I Know that a lot of you have to\nIt's weird when you're a young person to stand in a funeral home and look at somebody who a year or two earlier you were hanging out with at a party or school it's a strange thing to do\nSo this opioid crisis certainly affects people young and old but what really is is alarming people right now is how much it's affecting people better in the ... middle aged middle aged people are dying at a rapid rate of opioid abuse\nSo there's this effort now to combat the opioid crisis in America Congress is calling for a whole bunch of big government interventions\nThey've tried and tested in all shown did not work back in June the U.S house of representatives\nPast fifty bills fifty bills and and there's more on the way and these bills\nThrow around billions of dollars it already very wealthy universities and they place responsibility to determine addiction treatment procedures to the federal government\nI don't like it\nA lot of this new legislation is based on the over prescription hypothesis blames the current unprecedented rates of overdoses on an expansion in the number of opioid prescriptions that began in the Nineteen nineties\nThe consensus around this theory has prompted Congress to further restrict opioid prescription access so by responding this way Congress has pretty much ignoring years and years and years and decades of data our own data\nThat shows that what they should have known long ago when government restricts access to something people want it drives the demand in the black market and just the opposite happens you're trying to restrict access to opioids you're just going to get more people to turn to heroin\nOpioids are an increasingly difficult thing to obtain legally over the past few years here in Texas as a matter of fact if I'm not mistaken there was a news story that said that some health insurance providers we're going to stop providing coverage to opioid pain prescriptions so what does this do for somebody in the later years of their life who really suffers from chronic pain\nIt makes life pretty hard for that person\nIt's people might start turning towards a turning towards a stolen prescription medications or elicit alternatives like heroin sentinel\nIn the same way that prohibition push bootlegger to switch from beard a bathtub gin back in the Nineteen thirties drug traffickers are starting to uh to turn the narcotics with potent synthetic opioids\nOne of them is called superintendent all and I guess it's a substance that can be up to five hundred times stronger than morphine\nAnd our fears some junkie out on the street somewhere and somebody tells you hey I got an architect it's five hundred times stronger than morphine what are you going to do\nProbably going to buy it probably going to use it and you're definitely gonna get addicted to it\nPrescription drug monitoring programs are are known as P. D. MPs is right to state level limit on the number of pills a patient can receive\nThe DEA orders\nTo reduce opioid manufacturing and prescription rates are now at their lowest it's two thousand six but the overdose death toll over the last eight years is historically high why is that we have more intervention to make this stuff harder to get in just the opposite is happening more people are using it recklessly and getting her\nI'm not a betting man but I think I see the how and why pretty clearly here\n\nI mean it's clear that the black markets have claimed to the economy or has claimed the economy seeded by restrictions on the legal market\nWe've got data from the national survey on drug use in health and that shows that pain relief abuse rates have actually been flat since two thousand two but heroin abuse rates are increasing at a ... ... are are increasing only after prescription right started to decline\nSo we didn't really have a problem we had a minor problem and we made it worse with government intervention did you see what I'm saying here\nIt's it's bothersome and it seems so obvious and yet we keep doing exactly the opposite of what we should be doing so question is is Congress need to intervene yeah\nMaybe but instead of learning instead of learning nothing from our\nPast experiences maybe we do the opposite of what we did before maybe lawmakers want to spend billions of dollars in pile on even more red tape to paper over this k'naan from the government itself has created America's not alone in grappling with an overdose crisis\nBut a lot of our peers in

have wasted a lot of votes on the Libertarian Party and I don't mean to start the inter the interview off by suggesting that voting for you as a way but you know we we all know what happens when you're a libertarian you're very used to disappointment\nUm I I I checked out your old at the\nSame thing\nWhat them today where exactly\nDo we hit them today with a response and I'm a last night with a response and the response was real simple yet Ted Cruz was able to ignore that does call for a debate for Ninety Days despite that polling better than any Democrat in three decades and the U.S sent\nTed Cruz basically boom off for Ninety Days didn't care that the Democrat was demanding debates you literally ignored him however as soon as I on July twenty third brought the single open letter to the to to um I don't want to debate him once separately and alone at U. T. A. and M. or sell raw state and\nTed Cruz the second time together if you wanted to show up the Amarillo pioneer tiny publication in in ... Texas ran it within hours after that on the twenty third the campaign put it up on federal protects US DOT com for an audience of one Ted Cruz on a page that you couldn't find on the main page\nCERN within hours after that Ted Cruz and Jeff Roe his campaign manager at the table negotiating and agreeing you have to come to the debates\nNeal forty eight hour we could not ignore libertarian for forty eight hours me on the stage with the war was literally the nightmare scenario\n[laughter] ... you know we got to me I Love that we knew we got to take a quick break a cause you hang with us do another one real quick close if you're just tuning in I'm Talking to Neal died many years libertarian politician protects us She's going to war right now with CNN or whether even if you're a staunch Republican and you'll be interested in what he has to say stick around quick break right after this\nYou are listening to pursuit of happiness radio [noise]\nAnd we got a ride with oh too sickening feeling that all of humanity is a cesspool of your seat millions of the Rio Texas Rio talk used and sounds good everywhere ... Google played it could be your city on a hard radio\nHello Ken what's your junior you're listening to proceed happiness radio always love when you tune in so much for being here with us smokes all the small government liberty loving advice\nIt's out in southeast Texas that have been downloading the palm task\nHitting us up on the blog calling into the live show in the afternoon Conan in the morning we love having you here so they so much for supporting the show wouldn't be a show without all you guys and it wouldn't be a show without a somewhat controversial figures calling in to the show we've got one right now libertarian US Senate candidate Neal Dikeman use challenging Ted Cruz\nAnd he's challenging beta will run\nTo the seat for Senate as junior senator of Texas now if you're just tuning in what Neal Dikeman has been doing is going to war with CNN weather Neal wins this race for senator not I mean we know that it's a long shot for any libertarian in any race anywhere that doesn't really matter this is bigger than all of that\nNeal has done something very interesting with his campaign\nHis campaign has gone from being a rather on notice third party candidate to somebody that is going to war right now with what is probably the biggest cable news network in America not short of Fox News I think we all know that CNN CNN pretty much dominates uh for getting attention they're supposed to be they're supposed to be the middle of the road\nThe standard cable news network and they're not they're basically MSNBC light\nThey they'd be come to the network of the resistance movement they they really have stumped hard for me to work and they ... they violated possibly violated the equal time role which essentially specifies minute radio station or a TV station\nHas to provide an equivalent of opportunity to any opposing political candidate who requested if they give it out to another one so\nClearly broken the rule they responded to Neal's calling them out and and they really just missed him they reply to just said hey you know really matter what happens next meal I mean this war is over with CNN for you is it\nSo yeah a couple of Philly right and a couple of things to comment on there yet number one\nThis is not a lawsuit this is very simply a complaint filed at the FCC to do their job to make the elected officials like O'Rourke\nWho are in Congress and passed these laws live by the same laws they want everybody else to an ass CNN yeah one of the major and all ... organizations in the country to live by the same laws that you guys do\nAnd the Dallas Morning news and everyone else right if that's what it's about money not yet to get money out of politics and corporations ... funding yet not funding politicians do but here's what's going to happen we we actually put out an open letter yesterday saying look\nYou see is probably going to do nothing we're aware of that because the ... sea is supposed to be sex commissioners they're supposed to be no more than three from each party\nAnd in order to be non partisan if they have to have at least four yes votes in order to move forward with any problem you know the whole issue with advice and consent of the Senate and the executive branch not getting enough domination of and the\nSenate not confirming um all all the FCC's part and parcel of that problem there are only\nFour commissioners right now which means that would literally taking you must vote including the Democrat on the commission against the marquee yeah for a Democrat in the race the top fundraiser in this cycle\nThree weeks for two weeks before the election in order to move the needle forward and usually they take months to come to a conclusion anyway so most likely what happens as well yeah a a a a non progression or dismissal someone's down after the road after the election and then\nMy campaign and the libertarian National Committee has a as a a a a decision to make there is an appeals process that appeal process\nIs to the federal district court in Washington DC and it's been done before the libertarian festival they use this law in the last couple of ears to bring yet debate host to the table and included libertarians we weren't not demanding to be included\nIn this debate we were demanding CNN cease and desist what we think is an illegal campaign contribution by either bringing crews and canceling debate or simply adjusting their format so they fit within the typical coverage that they did\nYeah but Neal if they if they could have had you on the stage to counterpoint things the NATO was saying I Would have the courage to everybody in my that follows or listen to the show to tune in for that would have been brilliant TV I mean just to have you there just a fellow check\nIn on that and not to walk out of the race\nIt would've been awesome [laughter] that would have been so cool Neal I think that you have actually kind of maybe I mean this is an I ... I don't want to call an unintentional but you really surprisingly found a way to prove to me that the Libertarian Party can still be useful for things I've often criticized I've often criticized the Libertarian Party\nFor for doing one or two things first of all not working harder with liberty Republicans I feel like if if liberty Republicans and libertarians we'd have more ... with each other to talk about okay if you missed district in this region we have a candidate that that could that could maybe push for some libertarian oriented policies\nLibertarians are five percent of the boat they're not irrelevant but they're not relevant enough to win an adult I don't\nKnow how people think ideologically how you self identified about as many\nPeople in Texas said twenty percent range identify as libertarian as identify as either a liberal or conservative conservative little head\nYeah liberal and then to libertarianism we are right there but the party in my view has not done enough at our candidates have not done enough\nOr raised enough money to be able to punch through but this is not a three percent or five percent issues that we are a Fifteen Percent issues that if you stack rank and you notice you stack rank yeah I'm a liberty policies liberty principle the libertarian values against without\nWithout policy party label against the Republican and democratic values\nYou guys as voters more voters have more in common with my views than they do with either walk or crews\nAre and we got a few minutes left hearing the segment and since I got you on the line look ... give us the bottom line you know like why why should people vote for your why should people vote for a libertarian in his state where it's almost always Republicans or the other guy\nGo two reasons the first thing is exactly what I just and you and I have more in common together then you do with either the other candidates and you ought to be voting for not against you want to be voting for the person you want whether it's eight ten or ... and on against the third person so you can vote for the second\nRight it's your vote it's your call you want to be telling me who you're voting for you not to tell a pollster afterwards who you're voting for its your business yet so that's that's number one that's what we call for stack rank our policies strip the label out vote for the person not the party\nAnd good things will happen but let me let me challenge with this one question if you believe the two party system is functioning\nAs an all standing right there I don't think I don't believe in it for going on okay fair enough\nBut I'm going to give you some evidence to validate yeah you're brilliant brilliant believe yeah why\nTwenty Eighteen this one out of four races in Texas was one out of four on a post if it weren't for the libertarians that would be one out of three [noise] [noise] yeah why\nAll this money flowing in a hundred million bucks before it's done is probably football in this tax a set price because there was only about three to five percent of all the races that aren't safe that are actually competitive\nAnd so if we actually quite real you on campaign finance reform if we force every race to be competitive and if we start costing either the Republican or Democrat or race but they think they can win from the middle not in the primaries they will stop being worried about their own primary voters\nAnd they'll start worrying about you and I and the general election again and even if I lose you weren't going to win\nOkay I I think you put that very well and I said you you ... I think you make a great argument here\nIn the meantime writes a convincing people of all the things that you just said is is going to be a lengthy operative passed it could potentially take years\nTo inject that idea into enough average person's mind in the meantime while you're doing right now with CNN is I think it's\nI think that this is a very useful maneuver\nFor the Libertarian Party to help take down mainstream media outlets who are clear cutting of a liberal or leftist bias so that being said I feel like there might be other examples of other times when libertarian politicians could have done what you're doing with CNN why haven't we ever heard of anyone doing this before February why doesn't it happen more often", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
