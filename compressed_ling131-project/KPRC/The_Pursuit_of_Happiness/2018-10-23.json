any opposing political candidate who requested if they give it out to another one so\nClearly broken the rule they've responded to Neal's calling them out and and they really just missed him they reply to just said hey you know really matter what happens next Neal I mean this war is over with CNN for you is it\nSo that a couple of things you're absolutely right and a couple of things to comment on there yet number one\nThis is not a lawsuit this is very simply a complaint filed at the FCC to do their job to make the elected officials like O'Rourke\nWho are in Congress and passed these laws live by the same laws they want everybody else to an ass CNN one of the major and all these organizations in the country to live by the same laws that you guys do\nAnd the Dallas Morning news and everyone else right that's what the money not yeah getting money out of politics and corporations ... funding yet not funding politicians do but here's what's going to happen we we actually put out an open letter yesterday saying look\nYou see is probably going to do nothing we're aware of that because the FCC is supposed to be six commissioners they're supposed to be no more than three from each party\nAnd in order to be non partisan if they have to have at least for it yes votes in order to move forward with any problem you know the whole issue with advice and consent of the Senate and the executive branch not getting enough domination of and the Senate not\nConfirming them all all the way he sees part and parcel of that problem there are only\nFour commissioners right now which means that would literally taking unanimous vote yeah including the Democrat on the commission against the marquee ... yeah for a Democrat in the race the top fundraiser in this cycle\nThree weeks for two weeks before the election in order to move the needle forward and usually they take months to come to a conclusion anyway so most likely what happens as well get a a a a non progression or dismissal someone's down after the road after the election and then\nMy campaign and the libertarian National Committee has eight as a a a a decision to make their ears and appeals process that appeals process is to the federal district court in Washington DC and it's been done before the libertarians have been able to successfully use this law\nIn the last couple of years to bring yet debate host to the table and included libertarians we weren't not demanding to be included\nIn this debate we were demanding CNN cease and desist what we think of an illegal campaign contribution by either bringing crews and canceling debate or simply adjusting their format so they fit within the typical coverage that they did\nYeah but Neal if they if they could have had you on the stage to counterpoint things the NATO was saying I Would have the courage to everybody in my that follows or listen to the show to tune in for that would have been brilliant TV I mean just to have you there just felt like I\nSaid and done that I have to walk out of the race\nIt would have been awesome [laughter] that would have been so cool meal I think that you have actually kind of maybe I mean this is an ... I don't want to call an unintentional but you really surprisingly found a way to prove to me that the Libertarian Party can still be useful for things I've often criticized I've often criticized for the Libertarian Party\nFor for doing one or two things first of all not working harder with liberty Republicans I feel like if if liberty Republicans and libertarians we'd have more cockatoos with each other to talk about okay in this district in this region we have a candidate that could that could maybe push for some libertarian oriented policies\nLibertarians are five percent of the boat they're not irrelevant but they're not relevant enough to win in the lead don't\nKnow how people think ideologically how you self identified about as\nMany people in Texas said to twenty percent range identify as a libertarian as identify as either a liberal or conservative conservative little hand\nYeah liberal and ... and we are right there but the party in my view has not done enough at our candidates have not done enough\nOr raised enough money to be able to punch through but this is not a three percent or five percent issues that we are if if the person issues that if you stack rank and you notice you stack rank yeah I'm a liberty policies liberty principle the libertarian values against without without policy party label against the Republican and democratic values\nYou guys as voters more voters have more in common with my views than they do with either ... or crews\nAre and we got a few minutes left here in the segment and since I got you on the line look Neal I give us the bottom line you know like why why should people vote for your why should people vote for a libertarian in his state where it's almost always Republicans or the other guy\nGo two reasons the first thing is exactly what I just you and I have more in common together then you do with either the other candidates and you ought to be voting for not against you want to be voting for the person you want whether it's eight ten or Beto and non against the third person so you can vote for the second\nRight at your vote it's your call you ought not to be telling me who you're voting for you not to tell a pollster afterwards who you're voting for its your business yet so that's that's number one that's what we call for stock rank our policies strip political out vote for the person\n[noise]

at seven one three two one two five nine five oh now I I for one enjoyed watching the uh the rally I\nThink it was a I think it was really good for people on the right you know if you are a fan of deregulation and lower taxes\nThese are good times for us now before we get to any of that I and and I do have a lot to say about that and it's not all cheerful news but uh fortunately and unfortunately there's a lot to be said about that a couple of quick announcements on her break protocol here for just one minute\nI just want to throw a few things out there to all of our listeners I'm so yesterday we uh well over the weekend we got some news about Steve Johnson's father Steven Johnson the co host while these the host of theirs to host of the Walton in Johnson's ... heard all over the Gulf Coast\nEighty eight years young passed away friday night's rest in peace to him a woman Johnson not going to be with us tomorrow it will be best up episode and I put some really good content together for them for tomorrow morning to check that out but police say prayers for Steve Johnson stab today I'm\nHis mother Barbara is a is a widow now for the first time in her life and they've been together for a long time you know there\nSeem Johnson is a you know they've always been together for as long as he's known you know life is short as this is happening another interesting thing happened today John James ... name that probably doesn't mean much you know to many of you I I bet there's a few people listening to know who this guy is he's Ninety nine years old\nHe's a World War two vet he is served in the air force\nAt Ninety nine years old and he's alive today's his birthday so happy birthday to John James P announced Ninety nine years old world war two this guy kicked ass and took names during what could potentially been the most important World War\nIn history it's certainly for us here in the west I mean I think we all agree on that right if you're from whether you're from America England Canada you know the west anywhere over in this half of the world World War two was was instrumental to to paving the way for our role as the United states to become a leader on the global stage now\nJohn James be announced he played a little rolling himself he is a using\nAn American hero he's truly part of the greatest generation and I'm told that he's listening right now and I'm flattered and honored by that 'cause I thought you know I got some smart listeners but a lot of us are you know just beer spoiling punk rockers who grow up to become a libertarian and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but it's really cool to think that there's somebody listening to the show right now\nWho served in World War two unbelievable so John James ask you the show today is dedicated to you and Steve Johnson his dad and also\nMy sister in law Jordan Peterson she serves in the national guard she's a nurse she's an American hero is while she spent some time overseas you spent some time here at home she works as a military veteran whoopee TST my sister in law\nJordan Jordan boy or my little sister Jordan boy or die say what did I say I'm and I said joining boy right did I say I say joining Peterson how embarrassing sorry too much multitasking Jordan Peterson is not my little sister he's a professor at the University of Toronto no yeah it would've been\nReally interesting point that would be ... well maybe he identifies as a woman we do now know Jordan boy you're his ... birthday happy birthday to my sister in law she is she's an American hero\nJustice John James ... an American hero to very very different generations\nOne of them all millennial and one of them from the greatest generation\nAnd of course you have the baby boomers and Gen x or is that the genetics there's yeah there between them so hey make sure everybody for listening today let's talk a little bit about the aftermath\nFrom the cruise Trump rally we all know how it went we all watched it a minimal amount of people outside protesting I bet you do you know who was joining the herd of protesters this is so disappointing to me I I don't I don't get why he has to do this our ... our mayor\nIs a Democrat we all know that we all know what are we all know what's Sylvester Turner is like but the thing that really disappoints me is that\nOur police chief has to join in on the chorus line of pulling the Republicans art Acevedo hops on Twitter yesterday as a notable Democrat NFO social justice warrior came to us from Austin makes a lot of Austin and he really seems to hate Republicans I mean\nHe can't help himself he's there yesterday\nAnd it looks like there's maybe a dozen protesters I missed these people I went out there in the middle of the day before this broadcast yesterday\nAnd I was looking for protesters with my roaming microphone found none zero apps\nDoes I found I saw thousands of people out there are lined up to see Trump a live band people tailgating capitalism it's fine if folks on display on every corner people selling hats T shirts bumper stickers you name it cashing in on the love of making America great again well that's fine I got no problem with that I'm a staunch capitalist myself I think that's fantastic\nLater on in the day is people are starting to move into the venue at the Toyota Center to see Trump and cruise speak and was Eric there as well the ... the the people lined up outside you suddenly start to see a few dozen protesters maybe a couple of dozen\nAnd out there amongst the crowd is that blow up Trump blimp you guys know what I'm Talking about\nIn the photos you see on line they make this thing look humongous\nBut if you actually see it in person you see that it's roughly the high to like maybe two people earlier today I said it was as tall as three people but it's not it's shorter than that anyway it's interesting it's funny\nAs that is happening there was a plane flying around overhead and the plane has a ... to pay those name with a line through it and then it says socialism socks anyway so art Acevedo jumps on the Twittersphere and he says we're about Thirteen thousand inside with room for five or six thousand more inside\nHe got what he's saying he's saying oh it's not that many people at this rally All right well even if it's Thirteen thousand people that Trump's pun intended any ... or work rally by I don't know twelve thousand people what's the biggest ... work rally I guess there was that thing with Willie Nelson but\nBut you know those people are coming out to sea willy willy Nelson concert that's not a political rally she gets on Twitter\nStarts starts laying in the Trump protesters making it very clear who side he's on I got some more to say about this and I want to hear from you guys I Want to know what you thought of the Trump rally last night on TV seven when three two one five nine five zero more pursuit of happiness radio right after this\n[laughter] I was just it was more than just a talk show\n[noise]\nHalloween song is this ... Chris ... is a fantastic producer but I wanted to get in the theme of how we are we got from Halloween [noise] it's okay you don't have to change it is right there is a good song I like this\nReally this is great bumper music for us but I wanted something spooky it's scary not only to remind people Halloween Iranian people\nOf what happens if the Democrats take over in November\nSee it's not a scary with the southern rock in the background you know what I mean that doesn't have\nQuite the same effect if I if I break into my ... all the Democrats we walk off anyway so [laughter] ah once again happy birthday to a John James ... Ninety nine years old today\nAnd happy birthday to Jordan boy or my sister in law getting old kind of weird right I was in the bathroom a few minutes ago I'm Sorry to even tell you guys a story on the air and um\nYou know I'm just kind of getting fresh end up getting ready to get on the air and it occurs to me I have a very hairy back I don't know when that happened that I I I didn't used to have a lot of hair on my back this is it didn't even occur to me it was kind of go on like this and I was like what the heck and then and then I started thinking to myself\nMan getting old is one of those things where you know you don't\nDon't want to get old but you don't want to die young either it's like a lose lose there's no there's no real great way to get around that we all got to get up we all got to grow old and as you get older you're supposed to get smarter ideologically you're supposed to start to understand how the world works\nThat's why you would find so many college age socialist you very rarely find in eighty five year old socialist unless you're talking about Bernie Sanders right name another elderly senior citizen socialist I Know a few of you right now are saying Elizabeth Warren okay that's fine she's not that old but you know she's not young right okay well\nWe've got one here in Houston a guy who was too old to do stupid things like this it's our police chief nobody defense the cops as much as we do over here on K. P. R. C. or our sister station and Katie our age when there is a controversial new story\nAbout somebody in the police force nine times out of ten\nYou know we'll we'll give the costs the benefit of the doubt and start to look at the details of the case before we make accusations and that's why so many of these new stories which is something that most people don't do people on the left people down the middle the lame stream media they don't do that they don't look at the facts before they decide to rush to judgment they loved it\nThe people on our side versus their side we look at facts we look at history we look at we look at reasoning and that's how we form argument that's how we've\nPicked apart what our ideology is they're just using a motion and emotion is is nice but emotion is not going to help you are running army we're a nation or a governor city or a business for that matter it just doesn't\nKnow it doesn't it doesn't work and that\nThat's all they have their field by motion and it it's sad when when when you go to argue with them or have a have a good they they can't they simply can't and then it turns into an ugly situation\nTricia great call I really appreciate your Tricia from Lake City good call her call anytime you want um you know this is this is the thing this is just par for the course these days\nAre people on our side try to fight fair and we all know what happens and what and when we do fighting get aggressive and and argue back with them ah that's when they'll say Brett Kavanaugh doesn't belong on the Supreme Court he blew his temper imagine having somebody accused you of one of the worst possible crimes you could commit moments before\nYour wife's goal your achievement in life is about to happen [laughter] and they throw that to you I\nI never liked Brett Kavanaugh as much as I did when he blew is temporary and that was kind of how I felt last night when I was watching Ted Cruz getting excited up on stage but I don't want to know what you people think about it including the people that don't like um I also want to know how do you guys feel about the relationship with Ted Cruz and Trump right now\nVersus what was going on with them during twenty sixteen they did not get along well during Tony sixteen lions had has now turned into beautiful time Texas ten give me a call tell me what you think about that ... three two one two\nFive nine five zero more pursuit of happiness radio right after that you've got pursuit of happiness radio\n\nMS R.

I'll get a few bruised but they weren't getting stupid drunk they were it was we spend the whole drunk you know there's there's happy drunk angry drunk respectful drunk and then like Saturn depressed drunk and I you know two of those work well for me I said the gambling or what what did you think man any takeaway what were the highs and lows any reaction to it\nSo I I Would say the highs and lows where you literally is law and micro ... Houston salt so I saw young I'm I'm a I'm saying like teenage black kids out there\nI saw Asian families out there are so proud burger Ricans I stop in a more Spanish than the left wing ... ever admit to\nOh you're not you're not kidding Gavin there was there were lots of black people lots of Hispanic people there was a whole group they're called Latinos for Trump there was there was Muslims for Trump did you see that I did\nDid not expect to see that algae Beatty for Trump we've seen that before I mean Peter the deal in my last novel as we know those guys are out there but but you know you can't look at someone to know that they're gay so it's interesting when they put the shirt on and then it's like oh okay\nOh there were some different ones there's new or you know death on them that if there's something\nWrong with it but if they're required it feels like hey hey hey man joined the party yeah there's ...\nThere's nothing wrong with that hey you know what part of the ... the reason why you see that now Gavin is there's probably gay people who have been Democrats their whole life and then as soon as that Supreme Court ruling came out a few years back they thought\nWell that's it I was a one issue guy it's time for me to reevaluate this political party and after they did it they thought after the gay marriage thing I don't really know what else I got going for me over here I'm I guess I'm not a Democrat after all\nRight let me just say one quick thing I'm the only thing I had an issue with Trump's speech he didn't do any respect for the cage and uh I you know I don't I don't care for Kevin Brady otherwise she needed to give props to the people\nYou know just the normal civilians who cared enough to come from out of town to help out those who work in\n... great great observation and get out and you know part of the reason why that is true is and you'd you'd think even remember Hurricane Harvey they came here after Hurricane Harvey they praise the Cajun Navy at the state of the union address earlier this year so certainly he's aware of it\nBut I think some people ... especially on the upper or in the middle east coast over there or Washington DC they probably think of the Cajun Navy as a New Orleans thing they're forgetting that\nThere's a lot of cages and he used to manage it just drive around the city it's not how you can find a crawfish ma'am\nOh you are you Cajun molesting seven oh oh\nI should have figured that out I mean of course it's a French name again and I got a question for you man this is this is something that's weighed heavily on my mind I mean this is something that's really I've been I've been I've stayed up late at night wondering this\nWhy is it\nThat when you're eating crawfish in Houston you get that orange stuff on your fingers but when you go to New Orleans that doesn't happen\n[noise] you know it's well for one if you're going to a crawfish ... well ... chances are they're not actually patient people who made is probably the wrong with the red line but yeah that's how you're supposed to do it where I'm from\nRight okay well so if you don't mind me asking what part of Louisiana are you from\nActually I'm born and raised here that is from a town a north of Latvia my mom was from up allusions yeah earlier as much as possible but I was I'm a born and raised ... so I you know I still appreciate Cajun food but I Know barbecue too\nYeah hey dude I mean we got some good barbecue in Texas I I've been to I like Memphis ribs the Kansas City stuff's okay you go to South Carolina they got that yellow barbecue but Texas barbecue's good without sauce\nIt's exactly it's job right 'cause it's all about the wood that's what she said I\nGather ladies [laughter] any other thoughts on the rally Gavin\nI did not see any protesters I Wish I had you know I was kinda looking forward to it but um [noise]\nI Would have to say you've never seen a group of people so happy to just stand in line and ...
