I'm trying to speed commonsense to some of the most ridiculous people in America they claim to be anti fascist\nBut there are about as\nClose to fascism and the twenty first century as a ... and not show anyway so considering what Kelly Paul said the other day about going to bed with a gun under her pillow maybe you can kinda understand why Nikki Haley wants to take a break from being in charge of the UN but before we say goodbye to Nikki Haley and she'll still be here for a couple more months\nLet's not forget some of the awesome stuff that she did All right let's start with Palestine what Nikki Haley did to move the embassy\nFrom America from the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem that took steel ... days I\nThis is something that George W. Bush promised to do\nSomething that Bill Clinton promised he would do it's even something Obama claimed he was going to do and yet as soon as they all got elected guess how many of them did it none 'cause it 'cause it takes real courage takes real bravery to do something like that\nSteel ... figuratively speaking and I mean [laughter] you know it's funny that it's funny that it was a woman ambassador who had bigger holidays than any of these men who came before her none of them were bold enough to do it well what were they so scared of\nI think part of it as they were worried about upsetting the progressive political leader buddies over there in Europe remember what happened right after they move the embassy or when they just announced that they were going to move the embassy rioting in the streets\nHamas and Hezbollah coming out with all their little crony buddies only not cronies are terrorists cronies would be better I currently is just a corrupt politician these people are literally terrorists they use children as human shields the stuff that Hamas does is pretty sickening\nI mean it it's weird to me when I hear American progressive bragging about a boasting about how they're all about Palestinian rights oh yeah yeah is that right you're suddenly get this straight you're pro algae beauty but you actively support\nAnd defend the rights of the nation where women and gay people ... and an ethnic and religious minorities are\nAre harassed and intimidated in terrorized on a regular basis anyway we're just getting warmed up why do you think Nikki Haley step down I'm I'm baffled by the students is very surprising News I'm trying to make sense of it I Can't quite wrap my head around it maybe something you can help me zero in on the answer seven when three two one two five\nNine five zero why to Nikki Haley step down as ambassador there are no wrong answers creative funny answers win a prize called a show now pursuit of happiness radio will be right back [noise]\nPursuit of happiness radio\nHow's it going folks Institute in chemistry\nJunior here on Cape Fear see nine fifty I like to remind people were doing to radio show simultaneously well we're doing two shows\nWere doing a radio show which is what you're hearing right now if you tuned in on nine fifty in Houston you can also tuned into KP RC news talk radio on her radio people listening all over the country right now I think you so much similarly we're also on Facebook Live right now I Try to do this every day whenever I'm On the radio from two to three PM in the afternoon\nI Do on Facebook Live video as well so I have a little tablet here and I connect the audio stream to the tablets people can hear what's going on you know there's always new\nYeah who knows him I'm\nAbout as bad as you can\nLive in New York not far from nine and think\nWell\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider the loan that is right for\nCall today and let me get started\nReservations are required to call eight hundred and eight to two sixty four thirty four\nThat's eight hundred and eighty two two sixty four thirty four listen to ... to introduce president Troy Charlotte share how to find more safety income and security in your retirement years seeding is limited so call now eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four\nYear old car missed investments ... registered investment advisory from Troy sharp as an investment advisor represent investing in both risk including possible lost\nBadly hurt by thirty two percent over the last six years I'm Mark ... review the consumer affairs daily brave at Amazon dot com today\nMy\nTo your life with stuff you do like station happening\nSays like this conversation\n... radio dot com\nV. are so you know fifty Rio Texas real talk [noise]\nYes we're from commercial\nSee they weren't that many commercials it's not it's not painful you get\nYou get a little bit of me and then you get a little bit of the commercials and then you get a little more show it's no big deal\nHi Ken Webster junior its pursuit of happiness radio which not my show with your show that's what pursuit of happiness radio is\nIt's your show to call in and talk and then in between your phone calls I play really horrible comedy but it's just the worst and talk radio well maybe you'll like him I don't know anyway we've been talking about Nikki Haley and why she may or may not have stepped down and my last caller raised a great point um there was a disagreement between Trump\nAnd Nikki Haley in the past it was shortly after the summit in Helsinki in which Trump said he wanted to try to be friends with ...\nWhen this happened eternal McMaster Donald Trump's former White House national security advisor reportedly told colleagues during his tenure as president thinks he can be friends with ... I don't know why or why he would want to be well Nikki Haley kind of tend to agree with that statement\nA Nikki Haley the well now soon to be former U.S ambassador to the United nations didn't see the president's comments\nWere simply didn't care because at the time Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations said Russia is never going to be our friend and she did at the time downplay concerns over Trump's meeting and press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin she said we don't trust Russia we don't trust ... put and we never will they're never going to be our friend that's just a fact\nNikki Haley might have a valid point here ... ... is when he's a dictator I mean there's there's no other way to put it ... does in his country with his own citizens is pretty on wholesome and it's a pretty violent disgusting things that happen that regardless of what you think of America possibly making friends with him now I'm\nI'm a big fan of a ... of diplomacy I'm a big fan of making friends with your enemy court Abraham Lincoln and might not bank washing my enemies want to make friends with him of course that being said we may never be able to make friends with ...\nAt the same time we'll probably never be able to make friends with communist dictator Kim Jong moon but that doesn't mean we don't want to try to denuclearize or possibly prevent a third world war [noise]\nAll that being said it is possible\nThat Nikki Haley is just sick I have in the job I see your calls coming in a feeling Katie why don't you hang on I'll be with you shortly if anybody wants to get in on this why do you think Nikki Haley stepping down seven one three two one two five nine five zero John and the Galleria that's where I'm at right now same area do you uh do you enjoy the traffic in this part of the city John\nAh we're on the war is the one that I'm doing their work it out or do you go to war\nBut oh you're at the TV news station\nOn a ... construction there that we know why pastor charges took part in the weather\nYeah yeah when you when you see those TV guys walking around with their noses up in the air like they're fired stone staying don't you just don't you just want to have you done with all your guts\nAre mad whenever my boss told me that I was like the owner you know\nWhat about what about cute whether girls or John nothing wrong with that right oh\nMan it's it's pretty good down here but now\nDo you ever notice how and when they're when there's not any extreme weather a lot of these Weather Channel a lot of these weather girls very attractive especially when they're standing in profile position but then when some real weather happens like a hurricane that's that's when they bring out the middle aged balding dude who's actually a meteorologist\nSo he could give us her real explanation of what's going on\nYeah yeah so what do you think about Nikki Haley why she stepping down a mob\nAnd the things they break up with a lot of getting it all over the mainstream media\nBut also what am I\nDrove down south Carolina and you want to get in the south Carolina right and it was showing no reason I think in ... when John break you know miss work job but that was a you know that oh you know I think he's got to take a break and then try to get back in ... and you know what some something like that\nSo you think she'll go for Trey Gowdy said is that what you're saying\nYeah I'm On it now but I mean yeah I mean I mean I worked for her\nRight well you know that for those congressional seats in the house there's an election every two years now um she's very popular in in South Carolina and outside\nYou know another person from South Carolina I Would suggest she run against Lindsey Graham but boy he became very popular recently on the national stage like nobody saw that come and talk about growing a Paris steel ...

I don't know the point is he's a he's a journalist he's a reporter and\nThey want to launch a diplomatic probe a probe into\nWhat happened to this writer and journalist apparently he was killed inside the building that's what they theorize Saudi Arabia probably not going to allow foreigners to enter a consulate in search it and that shows a growing international pressure the kingdom is facing over the disappearance of this journalist who happens to be a writer for the Washington Post\nOkay um\nSaudis have called the allegations of any involvement in his disappearance baseless they're very offended by this\nHave any immediate comment on Turkey's announcement of whether or not they're going to allow to somebody to go and search their entered the New York times the New York times is very vocal about their outrage over this\nHow vocal are they when they're kind of vocal\nAbout it I mean they say they're upset but they're still selling trips to Saudi Arabia [laughter] I Know what I just said probably sounds very ... let me just go ahead and walk you through the details here the New York times is not canceling its vacation packages to Saudi Arabia despite reports that a journalist who recently went murdered\nA recently went missing was murdered in the Saudi consulate kind of a big deal probably something they should care about the ... the the newspaper the New York times has something called the journeys program oh the journey program it's some\nIt's diverse international it's all it's very nice us us New York's liberals just like it I don't know why my New York liberal talks like he's from the south and he's gay but I just go with it folks anyway so the New York times they they they want participants to join journalists and\nThe editorial board members for a two week Journey Through Saudi Arabia which I'm sure it's just a lot of fun unless you're a woman who wants to drive a car and I tend to live concert and then you can't do any of that stuff while you can technically but they'll stone you if you do it I mean they recently legalized bad in the country that's how progressive Saudi Arabia is but\nMy understanding of businesses if there's a woman that goes there and tries to drive or attend a soccer game or which they call football can you believe that but [laughter] not very friendly they're not very nice gosh\n[laughter] so what does it cost to take a trip to Saudi or we will be ... with the editors of the New York times eleven thousand dollars\nI live in the dollars good lord that's a lot of money that is a lot of money\nTo travel due in a press nation where you're not allowed to touch anything or speak out to turn or you could be thrown in jail cell or possibly murdered it's turkey consulate alright so for eleven thousand dollars what do you get you get airfare you get food you get five star combinations and A Guided itinerary through the middle eastern nation will ... will\nGee whiz golly gee gee whiz jokers that's that's awfully nice of you in New York Times here's eleven thousand dollars I'm\nI don't see this is a waste of money at all [noise]\nApparently [laughter] if you travel there with them you're you're going to have a gosh darn great time so the trip comes in the midst of the Turkish government concluding that Washington Post contributor and the U.S resident the guys from America\nSo what if he writes for the Washington Post but doesn't mean it is there is to get killed by Saudi Arabians and I and I as I said his name is ... he was killed in late September at the Saudi consulate and it's in a stable in Turkey the U.S however\nIs not officially confirmed if he's alive or not we don't know the latest on there so I'm just trying to give you guys the latest details here we don't officially no if he's alive or not but if you're if you're in Vegas Vegas odds on is\nProbably not alive I mean if somebody would take a bet on that and I do not encourage you to gamble but if somebody's taking a bet on whether or not this guy's living or dead I Would definitely go towards the latter not the prior All right so the New York times even published an editorial Monday entitled Saudi Arabia must answer for ...\nTickets available right now to travel to Saudi Arabia with the New York times editorial board but we're just getting by what they did a juvenile but will take you to their country right now for the lower prism just eleven thousand dollars it's a beautiful nation but we're sticking to the fact that they did this to an American journalists it's an attack on the press\nBut if you want to pay us to take you to their country and we'll show you wrote a truly great talking All right so they editorial goes on you're not going to believe that this editorial that's that's upsetting Saudi Arabia upper possibly allowing somebody to get murdered in their consulate\nYou're not going to believe this folks you're not gonna believe this\nBig took time you met new story\nTo to attack Donald Trump [laughter] you can't even rapists stuff as if Donald Trump is in charge of the nation of Saudi Arabia or had anything to do with it well they're saying that he has a close and coddled relationship with Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed\nHave you people never heard of President Obama have you already have you've never seen the photos of\nHim bowing down to Saudi Arabian royalty you're not remember when that happened oh yeah Donald Trump went there in dance did he do this or dance or something that's oh yeah dancing that's not getting what we have a proper balance down to Saudi Royal Dutch part and that's just showing respect but dancing saying\nBy the way for the low low price of just eleven thousand dollars you can travel all the way to Saudi Arabia with the editors of the New York times and if you're if you're lucky you might even take a selfie with you that's how great it is you know which it's really super you know you got for just\nFor sure they murdered and one of our journal is one of our friends in American but hey\nForget about that that doesn't matter what I always find Donald trumps the problem here in for eleven thousand dollars you could travel with us to

played some because when you do\nYou'll be unstoppable American series from your right after this is talk\n[noise]\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version of\nBombs\nAnd he loved him back to last segments do on the radio show today we've been talking about why people fail to become financially free fail to become financially successful live lives a quiet desperation um you know mediocre lives\nAnd one of the reasons you know we we talk about two reasons in this last segment so one of them was the lack mentality or the other one was the belief that the job is the only way to earn money those are two strong beliefs in our society\nUm but there's one other one and this is the ability to to to all your life away\nUm I don't have a name for it I got to come up with a name for structurally so that I can use it more more commonly but it's the ability to get up every day and go do life and ended up with nothing to just piddle life away one beer at a time sort of as his next article will cover\nUm but it's just like why is it that you wake up today and you know better off than you were a year ago you ever come in the end of the year two thousand sixteen what's different your life or you've heard people on tell del say well I bought it six houses is your next Germany by two apartment complex\nAnd you see people change their lives radically year after year after year when their members lifestyle but there is something different about what they're doing and everybody else because everybody else is out there working and everybody else is out there believing that they're investing because they believe that savings and saving is investing\nBut putting money in a four one K. are putting money and I are re or putting in his savings account\nIs not investing in your future is not building income stream it is not building businesses it's not helping society at all it's not helping you at All right and when you get done to shove your money in your pocket the end of the day the only amount of money of love your box what you don't spend\nBut not spending money does it make you more money you have to invest so I'm going to share this rather comical little spiel with you or somebody said\nTo me because I think it actually identified that situation [noise]\nThis is a conversation between a husband and her wife\nAnd the husband and wife and the wife has been do you drink beer and the husband said yes women says how many beers a day man says usually about three\nWomen says how much do you pay per beer man says about five bucks which includes a tip the woman says and how long have you been drinking man says about Twenty years I suppose\nWoman says so a beer costs five bucks and you have three a day which put your spending each month that four hundred and fifty dollars in one year would be approximately five thousand four hundred dollars correct and the map the man does some math and says okay correct\nAnd the woman says if a one year you\nI'm fifty four hundred dollars not accounting for inflation the past Twenty years would put your spending it one\nHundred thousand dollars correct\nAnswers after some calculations correct\nThe woman who says do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer that money could have been putting stepped up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the Twenty years you were there but you could have had a new\nAirplane and the man looks at the woman and says do you drink beer\nNewman goes no it looked through their face and says where's your airplane\n[laughter] you're gonna have to think about that with that what is going to go is so easy because it's not about a husband or wife arguing it's about the logic that living without actually makes your life better\nBut it doesn't\nAnd if you really look at it shows you could have an airplane that's even dumber\nCause your play would cause even more money so the entire conversation which was put together I Believe originally be considered a husband and wife type joke about a men's the money and how women see money\nIt really defined society you believe out there in your world that if you say five bucks\nIf you save a hundred bucks a thousand bucks a month it's going to add up to something and then you're going to be able to buy crap with it what is crap anything in life you don't meet but what you really need is not the ability to buy a piece of crap all a plane car jet ski boat\nYou need to have a regular reoccurring stream of income that you can retire on\nThat you can grow into the future so you can afford to buy is Mitch is many toys or as much crap use my vernacular as many toys as you want to buy and still not have to get up and go to work but nowhere did the lady she if you had all that money you could take a month off\nOr you might be able to have an investment in an apartment where did you could retire for the rest of your life you see the jokes can't even get that close to the reality of what it takes to become successful here's a wife or husband out\nAbout being wasteful and not having financial success\nBecause he drinks beer and those ... hey America all you guys out there talking about how great it is to save money and your four one K. and your IRA and your savings and little ... bill is college fund all that money out there and all those accounts is it making you financially free\nIs making you happy are you being able to retire and the answer to all the above questions is no\nNo no no you my friends have nothing\nJust like the lady who doesn't drink beer where's your plane my friends or in other words where's your investments that will retire you\nWear has your wealth gone that you should have had because of all the working and sacrificing you've done in your entire life my proposition is it was never there in the first place\nBecause working for a living is not the secret to becoming financially free it's not the secret to becoming wealthy and it's not going to be the secrets is going to allow you to retire\nIn any year in the near future my friends I beg you\nPlease change the way you see the world because as how you see the world is you a real problem as Einstein said and if you keep doing the same crazy stuff you're doing you're going to keep getting the same results and

year ago the anti circumcision activists were out there and I've heard that they have another protests coming up in October so I Will probably be there my producer Chris little is rolling his eyes right now like what is Kenny talking about these people travel around the country protesting against the concept of circumcision\nSometimes are a bit hypocritical when it comes to things like\nUm overspending by the Pentagon they don't really care when the department of defense over spend our money the way they care when side of the department of education over spend our money\nI Am not conservative and the traditional sense where I'm okay with that I have a problem with\nWhen you see these reports like I think there was one out from a year ago it's a hundred billion dollars of misspelling at the Pentagon\nWell that seemed like something we should all be pretty mad about but that's something that really only bothers conservatives and conservatives are the only ones that care about us spending money and since they don't care that much about the Pentagon spending money as they do about say uh the health care you know the department of health miss spending money it doesn't become a big news story even though it probably should\nAnyway I'm giving you a real long answer here on all this but my point is I agree with you and I and I could see room on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the fence on that the welfare a spending which is roughly forty eight percent of the money that we spend out there and the military spending which is the other forty eight percent and then that\nThat that that group in the middle there that two three four percent I don't have a problem with that it's like when people say\nI I I'm not I I Know I'm jumping around right now for topic to topic here but I just want to make something understood when I say taxation is that I don't really care if I pay you know one percent of my salary to taxes I don't care about that that's okay I get it burst society some people\nSome people out there it's it's supposed to be a democratically elected republic where we're not a democracy and the traditional sense but surely a cost something to keep the government going\nSo what how much of that would I be okay with foot frankly tax reform was nice what we got over the past year was great but we haven't really made any progress until we stop all the spending I said this on the show yesterday Richard I would put on that Trump pat tomorrow\nThat make America great again hat or what are they have a new green ... now that they're wearing I Would wear tomorrow and I would wear everywhere I go if Trump or just curb spending he spends like a Democrat and that's what bothers me so much about this Richard I got to take a quick break and you hang

people that work for you\nWhat ends up happening is\nAt a certain point it starts to look like the dollar is a negative amount of money right correct I don't disagree with you I mainly 'cause I'm not

tuning in I I Walk through some of the things that in terms of percentage is where your money goes and how much money actually just goes to the bare minimum when you ... you know Richard when they talk about a government shutdown it's something that you hear about every now and again and they'll say that roughly\nSeventy five percent of the only Seventy five percent of the government is going

guys listen to this radio right now which part of the reason why I keep saying he's a genius because I Know he's listening but he is now my my my uncle's a brilliant guy\nAnd he's been affected before by government shutdowns and I asked him so like tell me the truth Steve is this\nIs this going to be a problem for you and he said no what ends up happening is\nYou get a little time off from work\nAnd then when the government shutdown ends you get back pay such kind of like getting paid sometimes it's like getting paid for not working and you just get paid at a later date and you still get those days off isn't that remarkable I mean doesn't that either the crap out of you\nKnow my brother and he actually works for the federal or wherever I'm at the same way when it was shut down
