syndication 's real estate's indications and now the world is now saturated with people out there on the Internet just doing anything they can do as far as content to get you to connect with them so they can get you to invest in syndication blindly\nAnd that's what's happening is that your investing blindly to people that are blindly investing and the deals because why\nWhy does syndicator want to tell you to get into deals because they're making fees they don't care if the property profits or not that's not to their biggest advantage when they tell you you're earning three or four percent five percent return\nThat's not what they're earning earning millions of dollars to hear things crazier when you listen to these guys they will tell you that you were a pansy\nFor buying small deals I'm telling you the small deals are the ones we made the absolute most massive profits on two hundred three hundred four hundred percent returns I've made on small apartment complex it's anywhere from twenty to a couple of hundred units\nThese guys who want to use a glut of by thirty forty fifty a hundred million two hundred million dollar deals\nBecause they're getting a fee based on the price of the property the larger the property the larger the be the faster they get rich the more these big deals they can push through them more fees they make the rich or they get they don't care if the deal making any money or not\nYour money's locked away for Ken maybe even Twenty years at three to four percent return\nDo you really want that when you could have it investing yourself\nOr if you're not they do that at least if you invest with the members of lifestyles remember lifestyles doesn't do deals were an education and mentor but one of our members out there you could get with one of those\nAnd by the way one of the benefits of coming to watch tells is you don't have to go with the blowhard guy on the Internet\nWe have hundreds of indicators that you get to meet and no personally before you ever in touch with them really nice smart educated successful syndicator\nYou get to go look at the properties to lure them get to know them look at their financial statements\nYou get to

heart\nYou can go with the people that are all about success and profit you could look at the profitability\nIt back to I thought it was interesting I saw on the Internet an interview between as solicitor\nAnd another solicitor from lifestyles are what are the solicitors from less I said I Want to show you that I'm very proud that I Want all these national park association award for best product best price\nI Won the award for best place to work and I won best citizen civic citizen of the city for putting out a product that really changed the neighborhood and really gave back I've also got charities and so on and stuff I work\nAnd the other syndicate it goes I don't give a crap about any of that it means nothing all I care about is how much you can syndicate the more you can indicate the more money you can make and that's all I care about there's no need to worry about quality it's all quantity\nDo you really want to invest with that kind of a personality\nThat's what you are running into out there they're all over the Internet you just buy one after another after just go look up people on the Internet talking\nOut there speaking about the stuff I'm the loan guy who tells you I don't want you to put your money in my deal I'm not soliciting you I'm teaching you to be the solicitor I'm teaching you to be the educated passive investor\nRight I'm not out for your money they are I'm here to protect you I made my wife's\nTo protect you why do I not do it because I don't need other people's money to buy real estate I can buy ... deals ... own money why well because I've been very successful\nFor twenty eight years actually Thirty years of investing it because Everytime I make a major giant large gain that throws up a ton of money I busted back yet again\nI like owning my own deals no I've done syndication don't get me wrong I've done it for multiple reasons one because when the market crash in two thousand I wanted to buy everything we can get it right on well\nWe get what every one of the people in those deals or post ... percent returns or just a couple of years unbelievable deal because the market was down\nYeah when I can offer those kinds of hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred percent returns to the people that all of the ship is my own money\nBecause I don't want to say I'm going to give you a deal that earn six\nThere by the way most of our deals are in between six to ten percent return on the cash flow at this time right now which is a two thousand Eighteen October two thousand Eighteen marketplace is high prices are high so were earning six to ... percent\nBut the differences wording six to ... percent after\nThe ... is bite these indicators out there on the Internet or do you bring three to four percent and then they're taking a bite\nSo guys you're getting much red but the differences were setting it up where you can also get some of the tax benefits they're taking all the tax benefits that almost all these deals you're getting almost no tax benefits at all\nWe're able to refinance all to give you cash back a hundred percent tax free they're not refinance you got the cash and give it back to you there cross collateralized in their deals the equity that deals giving them the equity to go to another deal\nThey are re leveraging your own deal that you're in you not understand that

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders talking moments ago about the Pittsburgh synagogue massacres atrocity was a Chilean active mass murder it was an act of hatred\nAnd above all it was an act of evil author chastising the media for suggesting the president's rhetoric is to blame for Saturday deadly attack in the recent string a mailbox so only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts\nThere are a lot of people are just in the Democratic party um the fact that he's become a symbol is not an accident the fact that\nUh they're propagating this false with that has funding the caravan a is an effort to to give birth to this uh this blood libel that that the Jews are bringing in purity of the country they bring other people to\nDilute the purity of the country it's an ancient hatred and it's no accident that they've made a George Soros the symbol of this\nAll right so what representative shepherds essentially saying here is that it's Donald Trump's fault but a synagogue was attacked because Donald Trump is critical George Soros George Soros happens to have a Jewish background however here's something that George Soros is not\nJewish no it's true ... George Soros is basically an atheist agnostic a simple Google Search for George Soros and a little on his religious background will show this to you know he's he's not a practicing\nJew he's not an outspoken Joe I'm not even sure if he has a synagogue or not if he does I I couldn't figure out what it was from a simple Google Search and you would think of a billionaire deeply involved in a you know uh in\nAmerican politics would perhaps of some information about a religious organization that he's connected to posted up on the Internet somewhere he has not now has all this is going on and I are George Soros not a Jewish guy ah they suddenly it's become clear to people on the left that we can't criticize anyone who's vaguely Jewish without having\nOur without having our movement associated with anti Semitism is a funny thing about that\nFor years we've been defending the only Jewish country on earth the only Jewish state happens to be a place called Israel and for years we pointed out to people that Everytime you break down the anti Zionist rhetoric Everytime you breakdown\nCriticism of Israel it all goes back to anti Semitism it all goes back to guys like Louis Farrakhan or Linda SARS sour or I'm pro Palestinian people generally always tend to be anti Israel and when you really pick a part of what they're saying underneath it all what they're saying is they don't like these powerful Jewish people in America asking American politicians to\nSupport Israel it's it's pretty cut and dry here folks now over the weekend George Soros was not the only billionaire that uh that Donald Trump was criticizing there's another guy named Tom Steyer you guys remember Tom Steyer I bet you don't Tom Steyer is as much of a problem uh for people on the right as ...\nSoros says if you're concerned about people funding politicians that are against what you believe in he's a multi billionaire\nHe's a global list because the climate change alarmist and guess what he made a lot of money off of fossil fuels are going to talk a little bit more about him coming up in the next segment plus the legs in the legs and coming up one of our listeners was ad\nThat Donald Trump rally on friday I Want to talk about that at the White House for young black conservatives and a whole lot more don't change the channel seven on three two one two five nine five oh if you want to get in on this open phone lines and I'd love to hear from you don't change the channel we'll be right back oh\nPursuit of happiness radio\nIn Sri Pete envoys list\nPrice dealer probably still be happier if your car shop and you've probably heard these terms on black do they mean it's so confusing well and was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from two car it's a price it actually\nMeans something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true crime shows you what other people are paying for the\n[noise] we are back sucking back to the show can lift your junior here um so if you're just joining us one of the things we've been talking about is what happened in Pittsburgh on Saturday it's hard to ignore such a disgusting\nBlemish on our nation and what was going on in America this weekend seems kinda weird getting fired up about baseball or the world series or results when you know something like that just happened and this is something that we're all going to remember for a long time for good reason we've been talking about this growing movement of anti Semitism for quite a while on the radio but we all know about the all right\nI mean it's not a ton of surprised anybody what surprises people sometimes is the anti Semitism that comes out of groups like antifa were well a bit less surprising the black moslems Louis Farrakhan\nDemocrats here in our own city you haven't brace Louis Farrakhan literally embraced him there's a photo a video online of\nA Texas area\nOr a good congressional representative Al Green given him a big sweet hug and footage of Obama Al Green and Maxine Waters from way back before two thousand eight I think it was two thousand six fifty thousand seven with the three of them meeting Louis Farrakhan are members of the liberal media held onto this footage for years\nBecause they didn't want it to hurt Obama's chances of getting elected I think they knew what that footage amounted to and it's it's strange to think that they would hold on to something like that knowing what it was\nUm coming up by the way that reminds me there is a news story today\nAbout some information NBC had that pretty much made Michael ... claim\nAgainst Kavanaugh during the Kavanaugh hearings with that third accuser Julie ... all of his claims completely irrelevant NBC basically sat on evidence\nThat that probably would have dismissed a lot of Kevin ... biggest biggest critics if they just come forward with it isn't it interesting that they did anyway we have been talking about the thing in Pittsburgh and this guy in Pittsburgh or an a notable critic of Donald Trump\nA huge anti Semite hated Donald Trump hated Israel hated Donald Trump because he has a Jewish family members and supports Israel we have a caller he lives in Pennsylvania and I am told that he is located near Pittsburgh hey Dan you've called the show before right\nHe he kind of hung up before I got finished uh really talking to him we had to go to a break and then he wasn't there anymore\nRay Ray is a twenty year old black conservative that was at the White House over the weekend\nFor the young black leaders are ... a cock is that they had there I think that's incredible to what a statement to think\nI mean both they both examples Jew and re how this audience this radio show as as modest as it may be was able to reach out to people in both of these major news stories from over the weekend and happy personal connection with both of them you know what I mean\nYeah yeah and man I'm Sorry that happened and I hope I hope you'll reach out you know I Know you've got to find a new dentist now and that's probably the least of your concerns but I I Hope you reach out to people at the old office and see if you could do anything for him\nI mean [laughter] I mean\nIt really is man hey I'll tell you what we gotta we gotta ... coming up here and just one short minute we've got to pay some bills but folks were just getting warmed up on this I'd love to take some calls from everybody give us a ring seven when three\nTwo one two five nine fifty we haven't even gotten into black as they got in fact the the guy I just mentioned re if you're out there listening I'd love to have re call back if he's out there listening right now we had a listener\nThat was at that caucus on friday and since then this is just one of the news stories that's\nPretty much dominated the news cycle over the past forty eight hours I'm Ken Webster junior coming up Kanye West the caravan what's going on with life in a whole lot more in of course\nOur prayers myself in a color Danny was just on a list a producer Chris all going out to our friends in Pittsburgh right now we wish the best everyone out there don't change the channel quick break we'll be right back\nPursuit of happiness radio continues [noise]\nDon't worry folks some people in the comments section on my Facebook Live video particularly you David not a big fan of the commercials we got to pay the bills you can't be mad at us for paying bills it's okay we're ... we're back for breaking out though one of the questions people were throwing around here during break is a\nWire their political ads for Democrats running on that station\nShort answer is because I mean it's the law I don't think we can reject their money on the sea laws are about or you know equal equal time for opposing candidate but on the other hand there's a better question is why would they want to advertise on this station God only knows there's nobody listening to my voice right now\nSort of maybe a few of you I bet it's one percent of our listening audience that's going to vote for those candidates\nAnd and voting for those candidates will have nothing to do with hearing those ads on the station if you're thinking of voting for those candidates you're probably only listening to the station because you hate us\nThere is no way there's no way you're tuning into this station\nThere's no way you are tuning into the station because you don't want a 'cause you don't know how you feel about the Democrats for the most part I think most of you probably already have an opinion and your tuning into the station to get caught up on things and that's okay I Want to take calls from you guys I Want to know how you feel about what we've been discussing and also I Want to talk about blacks coming up at first\nA Christian or on the computer oh quick if you don't mind let's take a quick\nTrip it's that time of year I Love Halloween and all these horrible things happening in America suck the fun out of Halloween but here's the good news I found one haunted house it's not in Houston it's on the east coast that I really want to attend and apparently they have an advertisement you can hear [noise]\nAll the time\nThis don't go to one of those on the daily haunted houses\nInstead pick your children to the Nancy Pelosi haunted house of congressional alive [noise]\nFeaturing the Joe Biden\nGun control chamber but that double barrel shot con and fire to Blass he wants\nTo be some night man down the hill ways tired\nHe's still alive sprint through the Sheila Jackson Lee infirmary mentally of\nThe absurd that becomes more ... than the more you hear it and that's absolutely absurd\nTo us two thousand four presidential candidate how we're\nGoing to watch [noise]\nI don't take your kids to a boring do daily haunted house due to the Nancy Pelosi haunted house of congressional allies\nJust east of highway between the waffle house or the Firestone Tires [noise]\nSo we had a caller was Dan or re on friday I'm so embarrassed that I Can't remember this we had a caller I thought it was right it's re right we have a listener named right he's a young\nLaw student ... and ... in Massachusetts and he was at the White House on friday\nFor the young black conservative summit with Donald Trump and Don junior and a bunch of other people that were there and\nI for one uh actually want to apologize to him 'cause he called and I only talked to him for a second and then I put 'em on was Sandy and then we went to a break and then he was gone well here's the thing he's actually at school he's working are you studying and I just want to put it out there that if that was huge dude\nI salute you I think that's so awesome that he did that and part of the reason why I'm bringing in this up now if it wasn't for him calling into the show\nI mean we wouldn't have even known about that because the coverage on it was pretty minimal it wasn't until Kanye West a little earlier today attach themselves to this news story or got a got acquainted\nWith with the whole ... thing\nAnd and said that he's going to actually put out clothes on Qantas always website you guys know Kennesaw and says she's a young black conservative she's affiliated with turning point USA I think is the name of the group and um who's the other one in that group I guess it doesn't matter Charlie car cuts that and they're you know they're just young conservatives are\nThey they're not a new identity politics one of them happens to be a black lady the other is a white guy and they see eye to eye politically their friends they frequently get attacked when they're in public for their political views you know if they're out getting coffee or whatever it is they're doing so\nI really I really commend are young listener for calling in to the show first of all and letting us know that he was there but also just for being there in the first place because the press coverage on that was minimal at best\nAnd it it it really was a fantastic moment for America happening at a time when all these other terrible things were happening around the country I mean that one little moment I don't mean that arresting a pipe bomb guy or a synagogue getting shut up shut up was good it was it was terrible\nBut in a weekend full of horrible new stories isn't and nice to know that one good thing happened\nI think so we're getting calls about it right now it's called black it's called black exit ... plugs that is what it's called not unlike ... which is British the British are Great Britain leaving the European Union will blacks that he's African Americans leaving the Democratic party we're getting a call on it Kevin let me ask you a question your brother right\nIs or does it bother white people are black people and white people say or your brother\nNo uh and ... and if it did then they must have some strange shame thing you know going on or maybe it's jealousy I don't know\nI'm I'm trying to think of the coolest way to ask that question on the radio and like I'm a nerdy white guy there's no cool way for me to ask that question you know what I mean I I own it I'm a white guy it's OK I I I'm the first in line for a star wars movie and you know there's nothing wrong with that is again when you're a black guy what do you think about ... do you think\nOr is this something that the African American community is needed for a while do you think that this will be dismissed by the media any predictions about it\nFor one it'll definitely be dismissed media too I think it's something that should have been going on Twenty years ago uh I feel bad for anybody and she lived ... district after you know what a couple of decades for being there you're still voting for nothing happens\nAnd you know in the end would ruin black people to other people and we have to get that through our skills because we just", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "29"}
