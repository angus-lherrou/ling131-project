the people who keep us on the radio and pay our bills thank you all of our sponsors and not so rude after all\nWe were talking about taxation Richard called and Richard's on hold right now Richard so one of my listeners and part part of the community here the pursuit of happiness radio community so I\nI Love people like Richard 'cause that's this is not supposed to be just me talking to people I like when you guys call and Richard you made an interesting point you said that if you break down the dollar you have an El Al seat for your business\nAnd you pay your ... and after each time you get taxed on that and then you pay the people that work for you\nWhat ends up happening is at a certain point it starts to look like the dollar is a negative amount of money right\nCook I don't disagree with you I mainly 'cause I'm not a Democrat in my eyes are open Republican Republicans generally will agree with you when their guy is not in power but when their guy is in power they don't and what the Republican this particular administration\nHas made some great progress on tax reform I have no disrespect to them there but\nYou but you're right about that Richard it's frustrating and then it's upsetting 'em and you know that those are just tuning in I walked through some of the things that in terms of percentages where your money goes and how much money actually just goes to the bare minimum when you ... you know Richard when they talk about a government shutdown it's something that you hear about every now and again and they'll say that roughly\nSeventy five percent of the only Seventy five percent of the government is going to stay\nIn operation have you ever heard someone say that before during a government shutdown Richard\nYeah buddy ... downing\nStreet my my uncle Steve I hate to out him right now my uncle Steve is a genius\nHe's a he's a he's an aircraft engineering designs aircraft were both military and commercial use so he's worked in the private sector but he's also worked in the public sector he's a brilliant guys listen to this radio right now which part of the reason why I keep saying that you're genius because I Know he's listening but he is now my my my uncle's a brilliant guy\nAnd he's been affected before by government shutdowns and I asked him so like tell me the truth Steve is this\nIs this going to be a problem for you and he said no what ends up happening is\nYou get a little time off from work\nAnd then when the government shutdown ends you get back pay such kind of like getting paid sometimes it's like getting paid for not working\nAnd you just get paid at a later date and you still get those days off isn't that remarkable I mean it doesn't matter whether the crap out of you\nKnow my brother and he actually works for the federal or wherever I'm at the same way when it shut down\nDo you offer a couple of weeks with those that go on and then get the right it doesn't last that\nLong and it only right doesn't bother them at all so when it when you're hearing Democrats will talk about this call is another government shutdown looming you remember in twenty Thirteen they blamed it on Ted Cruz\nAnd said oh yeah we've had a couple of brief government shutdowns which is remarkable for two reasons number one it's remarkable because Ted Cruz is a senator and the budget is a vote that starts off with the with the president and then it goes to the house\nSo for there to be a government shutdown Ted Cruz is not the one that pits the budget and he certainly wasn't the twenty Thirteen but I don't want to and I wanted to get to our subject here but the thing the thing that really bugs me the most about taxation is not the fact that they take our money but what the crap out of way\nHave you ever heard of this study Richard about um [noise]\nUh the the amount of money at something like two hundred three hundred thousand dollars it's a six figure number but it's way too much money still to give cocaine cocaine to ... have you ever heard about this\nI Know that some like\nRight it's ... if you like your ... what the inside of me you know Rand Paul talks about this a lot when he's talking about reckless examples of government spending some for some reason every year there's this annual study\nA it's a federal grant but give money to researchers at colleges at some universities somewhere and they give cocaine to birds quails they want to see what's going to happen Rand Paul ... manages the genius point here he said you know I think\nThat the the the net result the sum total of all these studies which they've done a study multiple times is that you probably shouldn't give cocaine to ... why do we need to keep having to study right in Houston we have our own problem very similar to this it's as ridiculous in as silly but it looks like progress on the ...\nWhere we were small station but at that point ... thirty eight hundred dollars a day is what they're taking it seven days a week one station a recording you got for gas stations on the corner\nRight yeah where's that going it sure ain't going to a row\nIt goes right to it goes to Jackson Costco and Sheila Jackson Lee because they I mean somebody has to pay all the Democrats Greg who who I got to pay their salaries that's what we have\nTo work hard for start with Sheila Jackson Lee in her gerrymandered district\nYeah it is okay ... oh you're right have you guys ever had people listening right now if you want to understand what ... talking about Democrats are always complaining about gerrymandering has anybody ever seen a drawing of Sheila Jackson Lee didn't drink it looks like a hurricane coming up out of the city of Houston\nThere's this big empty hole in the middle of it Chicago's just as bad Chicago has a district that starts off on the north side\nGoes downtown cuts out to the west side turns into just a little hair of apparently a crosswalk shoots down to the south side and then becomes like a big cancerous tumor and it's all places where the have nots lip and they're just there because they want to take our money and that's all it is due to the welfare state it's why it exists\nOr the other thing it gives them the Democratic voting bloc like doing it\nOh they love it you know in Illinois in Texas all just as bad though man I mean we've had Democrats in the past to allow that to happen\nWell and it's going to continue to happen but the real truth is now somebody actually making little and you can buy\nYour hearing manager district didn't stay I Want one can you can actually\nGet one or the sheer accurately gerrymandered district and the state of Texas\nOh that is funny we should get tee shirts we ... we should have T shirts made we're coming golden\nOh it's genius of course well triple crown we got to have that too right\nAs your guest or in Illinois even oh I Believe it out of there and they they even say you got one we didn't won't make it for a\nGenius Greg it's genius I\nWish I'd thought of that idea first but I'll steal it hey here's a thought grudges called up to talk about a great called right I really appreciate the call Greg made a lot of good points there and he was talking about the hidden taxes\nHere's attacks we've all forgotten about take that smartphone out of your pocket right now you see that phone you got there maybe it's an Android maybe it's an iPhone whatever every time you pay your phone bill you're paying\nThe Obama phone taxes to pay as you go thing just like the drainage the tax in Houston but that doesn't mean it's a good thing or who who was it that ran that that Obama phone program wasn't it I read somewhere once that it was Carlos Slim was making all these cheap cell phones I don't know if that's true or not but\nUm it it it it certainly seems like it could be true especially if you consider the impact Obama had on the Obama phones which the funniest thing about that is the Obama phone program wasn't even started under Obama\nIt just got the name in fact it had been around since George W. Bush anyway I uh before we run out of time here in the segment there is something big and it's coming soon to Texas and I don't want to run out of time for this before the show ends\nI Am really excited about this because if there's one thing I Love it's a political circus I like to get out there with a microphone and shove it in the face of people on the left and ask them questions they don't know the answers to and make them look stupid in front of thousands of people because exposing ignorance is basically my\nIt's a hobby at a job in her career for me but anyway coming soon to or coming soon to uh to Houston, Texas\nSugar land to be more exact but everywhere else in the country to for those you're listening to us on line on Facebook or I heart radio this is coming everywhere in the country were there were people with money so it's definitely coming to Houston more specifically sugar land very soon for only seven hundred dollars you're going to be able to buy a concert tickets to this\nLooks Oxford venue when your city fits in Hillary Clinton why\nI Am I'm into ... and that's what I intend to do\nFor the price of just seven hundred dollars you can put up front row seats to divide speaking of every year featuring the biggest political theater\nLet me just say perfectly clear about this ah am hiding from Hillary for the\nFirst time ever find out what Hillary really fits about sharing with\nHe was literally breathing down my nephew my skin\nCrawl find out what is the best part of being married is\nVisible what many of the word is\n... arrived early and find out what former president for Rocco farm I had a great time with Hillary and bill was Hillary Clinton in the house last night so why not sort of every year Hillary Clinton onstage what'd you cram for my ticket master\nDot com or wherever Saudi Arabian royalty are donating money to democratic fundraisers I really regret doing for\nEarlier this week Fox News claimed people are applying for medical marijuana dispensary licenses in Oklahoma at a rapid pace currently the ratio of legal we dispensary licenses to consumers in Oklahoma is twelve to one that means there's twelve consumers\nFor every one dispensary and it doesn't even mean that they're going to buy the pot that's how many people are trying to stop illegal we'd in Oklahoma it's a lot of legal we'd folks meanwhile legal we'd popping up all over Louisiana a new medical marijuana clinic is opening a boost your city Shreveport area this week and it's not alone\nThere is a doctor there his name is Dr Chad ... of internal medicine doctor from the ... area\nAnd he's going to be drawn out marijuana prescription left and right to anybody who needs wanting wants one\nBut Louisiana in Oklahoma they are not alone don't forget about Arkansas and New Mexico both of these places now destinations for medical marijuana consumers legal marijuana in one form or another so with all this legal we'd popping up around the middle south region of these fifty United States one has to wonder\nWhy tax that come on people are we not liberty minded enough state to legalize a plant it's a plant grows out of the earth\nIt doesn't hurt anybody they're exactly zero overdoses on marijuana ... not just this year this decade but in the lifetime in the entire existence of marijuana existing right\nThe answer to this should be obvious right why aren't we legalizing a plant in Texas will legal wheat and tax it's become the casinos of the last twenty or Thirty years\nWe never really got casinos and taxes either did we only recently did we get legal poker in Houston and they are fighting against that tooth and nail tuned into Parker lab radio Saturday nights on sports talk seven Ninety ... eleven PM unless there's an Astros game and then you can listen on the on line scream that reminds me\nWhy is everybody\nSo uptight about this marijuana thing [laughter] why do taxes lawmakers insist I'm living in the dark ages I must issue unfortunately we don't have a good answer to these questions I Wish I did I don't I don't know I don't know why we don't have it\n... says I'm living in the dark ages on this one issue where so where so advanced everybody else when it comes to business regulation taxation this is a state that really understands how to get the economy moving but for some reason there's this one plant\nYou can use it for cancer patients and AIDS patients can hold down their food and people with glaucoma arthritis\nConsistently people people with legal access to CBD Oil have a lower rate of opioid addiction in their region than people taking off the lights I mean it's it's so obvious I ran out of time I am kind of left her junior I must now walk\nNot run to my house because I kept running on the radio station people get mad when I Do that things are listening twice a day listen to proceed happiness radio early in the morning before ...

against black burning and likes fell imagined that Phil Bredesen having a little having a little me to go to air out there\nMaybe to a strip just doesn't know you know it's possible she's just a little ignorant everybody doesn't know everything about politics and people are encouraged to wax\nIntellectual on these things when they have no idea what they're talking about it just occurred to me this is the second time this week that I opened up a morning show with information about Taylor Swift and county so I Apologize German time when what was it did she she won a Grammy and county west storm to the stage who would've thought\nThat all these years later what what Conyers was mocked at the time especially by conservatives and people on the political right for his disrespect Taylor Swift but now looking back on it that\nMaybe it was a crowning achievement for the early ... movement you know shutting down Democrat Taylor swept with a black Republican bow yeah go down you can you I guess I don't know like I care [laughter] it's funny to think about right\nI mean we forgot about that we forgot all about it anyway in the meantime Taylor Swift is encouraging people to get out and vote and an interesting thing happened in Tennessee first of all fills polling numbers have not gone up\nSince Taylor Swift made the announcement quite the opposite actually Marsha Blackburn appears to becoming more popular in Tennessee\nAccording to the latest polls you know trust those like a grain of salt as far as you could throw 'em all those polls always lean harder the laughter than reality should be dictating remember all the polls that said that Hillary would win by a landslide\nThink we know how that ended anyway so [laughter] didn't end well for her did it to oh gosh golly gee ... in the end after Taylor Swift got political and started coming out against a Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn just the opposite happened that you might have expected her polling numbers went up and in fact\nTaylor Swift may have enraged for the Republican voting base because instead of\nHurting Marsha Blackburn she got a lot of people to go out to register to vote and then the evidence I mean we don't know for sure who they're all going to vote for there's really no way to know until election day but since Marsha Blackburn polling numbers went up and the number of people registered to vote went up one could probably assume\nThat you know that part of Tennessee that's not Nashville well that part of Tennessee really doesn't like and agree with what Taylor Swift set\nPeople in Nashville forget that sometimes but it's a lot of people living in Tennessee I mean it's not a small state by any means there's millions of people like how many how many people live in Tennessee how many would you guess well roughly six point seven million so it's it's about the population of the greater Houston area right well how many people live in Nashville\nHow many of those people are in Nashville natural population about six hundred thousand to millions of people in Tennessee\nAnd maybe ten percent of them live in Nashville\nThere's your democratic voter base there's your Taylor Swift fan so I guess who re for Hollywood I got a funny feeling [laughter] Taylor Swift left wing advocacy not gonna not going to help the Democrats the Tennessee just as much as it's not going to help ten it's not going to hell Taylor Swift felony records but had gotten time will tell them we'll see soon [noise]\nPlease use these people are offended by anything you heard take out a

when it was incredible and they got to get back and get on with\nThere was talk of including the Supreme Court justice if Democrats take control of housing\nBut will you support would you support an impeachment effort if your party controls\nThe house and say this and then move for Democrats politically ... ethically morally to pursue potentially an investigation that could lead to play\nThey have and painting not private but\nKavanaugh now that he has Supreme Court justice riding on this idea that Democrats are are if that happens hands and they said ... it's a way to keep the enthusiasm about this nomination and plan isn't realistic to expect an investigation that potentially and with impeachment\nProceeding cabinet off they get control of the house possibly looking at impeachment uh what do you make of those pledges that they will be an attempt to impeach adjusted capital [noise]\nI think that it said they would you support the house investigation at the start for an impeachment

vote for their voters to is something like and it's like\nA whole lot of these when we've only had one about ... ... they are afraid of everything it's like oh we can't have Hillary Clinton talk

with soundbites of media personalities those were not Democrats while they're Democrats or they're not elected officials are not politicians\nFor all the different news outlets in America I'm mostly NBC ABC CBS CNN headline news local news outlets encouraging Democrats politicians during interviews\nTo try to impeach Kavanaugh now that he's on the Supreme Court\nThe guy finally gets confirmed he finally gets where he is and the left just doesn't get it the left thinks that they're going to win an election by impeaching people who the general public just voted to elect\nLooking at Trump didn't win the election that long ago that was still less than two years ago what's getting close to two years but isn't it weird Trump's been president for almost two years but in the meantime\nTimes flown by and all there were all the Democrats\nHave done since then has tried to convince us that this election with Trump is not legitimate it's an illegitimate election and therefore Kavanaugh's illegitimate that's their new thing now and Trump needs to get impeached Kavanaugh needs to get impeached too and that's all they can talk about\nSimilar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and ... and others today\nWell there's a very significant difference and that is really intense long lasting part of an investigation that was conducted in the nineties\nBy Canada ironically that the other Republicans starting with President Trump on down a want a comparison nation welcome such investigation themselves\nSo what she's saying is there's a difference there's a

phone more with me anyway there's two separate black lives matter protests going on around the country right now a massive massive protests in big cities you probably heard a lot about the one in Chicago\nUm where you know that that we've we've talked about that at length in the past and I'm not going to talk about it much right now police officer charged and was convicted of murder I think he was right pretty pretty incredible what happened up their police officer found guilty of murder\nJason Van Dyke was his name and uh yeah I mean the people to Chicago I guess they got what they want and shot a guy sixteen times\nAnd people are furious about well that that trials coming to an end now so if you're upset about it there's no need to keep ... ...\nWhat are you going to protest so that you want and found guilty of murder you got it how many how many dozens of murders of taking place on the south side then they'd go completely ignored in Chicago Chicago's south side is a third world ...\nIt's a failed state it's a civil war\nWell somebody else is happening out on the west coast right now more than a hundred people march through downtown Portland over the weekend and since then to protest the death of Patrick ... Patrick Caymans was fatally shot by police officers last Sunday\nA week ago Sunday go\nCop shot at him and he's a black guy oh man that probably drives people nuts\nWhy did they shoot it and what was he doing well he just shot to other people he just shot to other people I remember that because that little bit of information is very important for what's coming up here on the show what's about to happen\nSo this protest is taking place big group of people and includes members of Kevin's family they gather near memorials that supporters it set up over there and Harvey Milk screen it's a parking lot where the shooting occurred there's a lot of homeless people over there I'll talk about that some more than a minute\nIt's not a nice area Portland most parts of Portland are nice this area's a little rough so that the activists the antifa and black lives matter and everyone else marching through the downtown Justice Center were speakers including relatives of the of the so called victim demanded police accountability\nSo it's a news report on this today in Oregon why they don't even mention the fact that this guy was shot\nAround three thirty in the morning on September thirtieth after he shot to other people police officers are gunshots from inside their vehicles that\nThere was a fight in a shooting two men were wounded and police saw this guy coming towards them holding a gun officers yelled commands told him to drop the gun he didn't do it so they shot at I'm struck them in the upper torso in the leg so now we're waiting for\nForensic analysis from a state crime lab over there in Oregon on the revolver sound found near came in and for other guns recovered at the scene\nFor Kevin shot the two other men at the scene that's uh\nThat's where it starts as you're saying that's what the report claims that's a witness this thing police officials have said little publicly about this I guess you could see why it's a tense place in in Portland and a lot of people are coming out for these protests a lot\nDozens of people out there protesting I played some audio earlier this week of MTV activists shutting down an intersection so they could protest\n\nThat's how angry they are so angry so much anger from these people on the left they get angry they get violent\nAnd they don't even bother to take the time to actually investigate what's taking place why was why wasn't there are shooting what are the details of the case they just know a black man was shot and that's all it matters\nFormal it makes it something that you become comfortable with and then it like riding a bike and then you have the fear again because you'd have to get out of your comfort zone and do something else but you already have the foundation for it with the education that you've taken to that point so it can propose to the next up\nAnd you know I think that the biggest misconception that I hear is people think that we're telling\nIndividuals to scrap everything you know liquidated everything cash out of all of the things that you've been saving for and you've been taught at the Safeway and investing your entire life and that's just not true real estate is not one size fits all\nYou can move as quickly or is slowly as you want to ironically I Am one of those individuals that want it to move very slowly I Am a I'm going to put my ... in the water to check out the temperature I Am not the I'm going to cannon ball into the deep end right off the bat but as a result I put my chip you tell in the water temperature was good\nTook the first ... seconds before you knew it I was swimming in the deep end and I didn't even realize how I got there so I made that fear of change are being uncomfortable a success pattern so that's kind of where it goes from there the other thing that I Can't stress enough it's never be afraid to ask questions\nSo I'm One of the church here with lifestyles unlimited and I will not lie to you and tell you that I Know every single thing there is to know about the economy and real estate and everything that you could ever possibly know and anybody that tells you they can is full of it so you want somebody that is just as nervous\nAbout the situation that they don't know the answer to\nHelping you because the person that's nervous or the person that is a little afraid of change or a little has a little bit of fear of the unknown as well that's the person that you want on your bike 'cause that's the person that's going to research it and go down that rabbit hole of gloom and doom and find the answer that you need so\nI get off the numbers all the time because they don't want to disclose to me when something is going wrong and I'm saying no\nTell me you're not going to change anything in your situation if you don't take the option of asking for help we're here to throw life vests and gets you out of situations that help you were given advice and tell you hey you need to take a left you need to take a write in a way going back to your point about driving home and\nThe road being blocked because it's overcome with water\nLifestyles unlimited is your GPS system we are the ones that say hey whoa whoa whoa turn around don't drown we need you to take a left right now we're going to get your home safely um it's going to be a different route but it's going to be much better so that helped people need to start looking at it\nUm I also encourage people to take their time and make sure that this is what they want to do you know there's nothing worse than an impulsive individual that just changes everything in their life and\nThen it was ... later on so you have to know yourself and know what you're capable of taking on and like I said the biggest tool that we offer is a strong education a tried and true it's hard but it's been tested time and time again\nOver the course of the twenty eight years at this company has been in existence\nI always recommend emulating people that are successful that you want to be like you don't want to be like the person that\nYou know lost all their money when they were doing flips or that guy's neighbors friends rather than we had talked about earlier that how 'bout rental one time Twenty years ago and had a bad experience with it don't account for advice that guy's going to give you all the wrong at ...\n... people that are successful and what they do ask people that are confident in their abilities to know the answers and if they don't know the answer is that they will find the answers\nSo it's a it's a continuing education process and that's where it's fantastic because I always want to grow I Want to expand my thought processes I Want to be able to know what it is going to happen in the future and be prepared for it\nThough it's a continuing education but is a lifelong education and that's the exciting part about real estate because things do change and we're prepared for them based on our experiences and our ability to have dealt with change initially\nAnd I think that goes for way is because for anything that we do in life right uh you know being able to um to get educated\nSurround yourself with success ask questions to be transparent find a mentor who successfully done what you want to do the way you want to do it and then take action walk through that fear Jillian today shows coming to an end\nBut
