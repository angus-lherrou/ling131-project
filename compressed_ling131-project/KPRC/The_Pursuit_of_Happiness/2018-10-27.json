I could wake up on the other end which was actually kind of cool when I was flying a lot\nIt was really really helpful I was flying a lot not getting a chance to sleep regularly because of work and things of that nature so the fact that it helped me get a little bit of rest on planes these hypnosis apps I really liked and there's this one company on calling us who was mined by mind to maybe that was a company that\nI haven't used them in a while but this was a company that I I got 'em all from and they were all completely reliable but then I noticed when the company came out with a couple of new ones there was a twist at the end of a I guess it was meant to be healthy thing but they said hey and you know tonight\nOr tonight after you go to bed early in the morning after you've gotten all this really great sleep that you're going to get because you're going to sleep better as a person in general you're going to have venting dreams and\nDarned if they didn't change the quality of my dreams these hypnosis apps and I stopped listening to him because a vending dream I guess there's maybe where you let go of a lot of stuff I don't know if there's a term that exists maybe you're a medical practitioner you know something about it maybe it was just something that the people at the hypnosis app company came up with\nBut I Will start going like oh my God [laughter]\nEvery single time I listen to one of these things is that I Would have vending dreams and I don't know it wasn't really something that I Would sign up for voluntarily so I might give the nightmare inducing Burger King sandwich\nAnd the big all ... you try get back to me [noise] let me know how that works out for you [noise]\n[noise]\nA great way to get over break up according to doctors is to have sex with your ex yeah apparently the best way to get over someone after ... is to get back on top of them and then perhaps underneath them and then side by side with them and maybe on top of him again for good measure because believe it or not according to a new study\nOut of Wayne State University in Detroit the doctors they're determined that one of the best way to get over your access by getting it on with him one last\nThe researchers say that people who did that with their acts after a break up were less likely to be depressed and felt better overall on a day to day basis why well they say that having that final her on one more time actually gives you a real sense of closure which can help you start to move on and and now you know\nMcCotter's did okay and the ratings that counters you'd okay and the ratings on Tuesday night it average ten point six million viewers\nAlthough that number might climb a bit wants TV aren't delayed viewing are factored in there a couple of ways to look at that on one hand it was exactly where Roseanne left off this past spring when ten point six million people watched the season finale on may twenty second but it was down from last season's premier\nWhich attracted sixteen points to die Eighteen point four million viewers now so it might say that it's down because Roseanne Barr isn't on the show any more\nBut it's hard to make the direct correlation because last season it was coming back after having been off the air for twenty Twenty one years and there is tremendous anticipation rabbit and this season it was coming back after being off the air five months of the big question is now that the hype and curiosity factor has gone will the ratings settle in\nAnd whatever that number is it'll be hard to say whether or not it would have been better with\nOr without Roseanne speaking of watching things an on demand viewing and all the above your here's a story I promise we get to [noise] for whatever reason people are tweeting about all the things today's kids are missing out on by growing up in the Netflix they're here some of the highlights little trip down memory lane back when you were a kid [noise]\nApparently kids will never know the high stakes adrenalin of running to the bathroom the fridge or the bedroom and a single ad break without a sibling screaming it's on descent you hurtling over the furniture to get back in time next year we did that [noise]\nSomeone mentioned how you'd wait to go to the little boy or girl ...\nDuring the commercial and then have someone steal your seat or take the remote while you're gone and others said they learned it eight five minute shower so you'd miss the show or the high stakes game of finding a blank tape two minutes before you realize it's on and it needs to be recorded oh that was a big one in our\nHouse all the teams are recorded on I'm just going to record over your show don't do that data I buy the video because as in this house [laughter]\nOr having friends on a three way cause you get all watch the episode together as it aired can you think of any maybe now at ADS act these where you can find me on Twitter and Instagram or you can email me a D.

Chris of the ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSome smart and your smart speaker elect so sleepy or see on all your great if\nWe are back our experience of telephone issues I Apologize folks right now we were going to have my buddy brand and more song from red state but live radio doesn't always go the way that you want it to go so are you guys are calling in a I Apologize it sounds like our telephone system is running through a distortion pedal for a guitar\nSome of you a percentage of you will know exactly what I mean and the rest of Europe probably thinking well what's wrong with that guitar sound cool All right well not when you're trying to run a vocal process or through um it doesn't sound cool now there's something\nSomething very wrong with it right now hey you know other news though not to worry though there are other things there are other things happen in that you're going to want to know about and uh yeah let me let me pull something up here right now\nUh so I think we all remember when this happened right this is the most self on aware person in politics or maybe she knows exactly what she's doing a Maxine Waters when I say the name Maxine Waters what do you immediately think of for representative Maxine Waters she doesn't live in her district\nAnd she's a lawmaker that's amazing right I mean I get it if you live right down the street or if you used to live there she doesn't live there at all if you've ever been in Maxine Waters district in in Los Angeles\nIt's kinda like you're driving through Skid Row it's nothing but syringes hanging out of people's arms uh junkies throwing feces at each other it's just the disgusting the worst place in LA that's where Maxine Waters is the lawmaker the congressional representative of that is what Maxine Waters represents right\nSo she seems to think and get ready for those folks\nShe seems to think that Donald Trump is encouraging violence\nLet me rephrase that in different words after calling for violence Maxine Waters is accusing Trump of calling for violence irony level palpable I mean are you serious right now and he gave me a break earlier this year we factor was back in June twenty eighth team representative Maxine Waters which famous for saying this right here\nOf course the lives of president says that\nAll of this constituent I'll do\nThat and his constituents support as I\nAll the time but I didn't do at that time okay so it actually\nWas not the ... that was her talking about how she didn't threaten anybody that says she didn't threaten anyone All right so there she is saying that she didn't encourage violence right well I I think that I think that she actually did encourage violence um she she's she's done it more than once if I'm not mistaken but here's the soundbite I think I was actually looking\nFor that we\nHad to show your\nAdded yeah Filene's station\nTelling their not wind them\nIf you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant you talking about Republicans ... conservatives at a department store at a gas station in a public place you get out you create a crowd a crowd which is another word for a crowd anybody\n... mob mob would\nBe a word for word I Would use right\nYou get out and you create a mob you push back on and what do you think what does push back on I mean somebody's trying to eat dinner\nWith their wife pushback on him what does that mean well I think it literally means use force folks I'm not trying to draw lines here where they don't exist this is representative Maxine Waters this is our rhetoric great I hate that word rhetoric wow that's what it is\nAh the crowd cheered everybody wanted\nTo Republicans were going to be made public and their wives and their kids in your\nGrandma's you were just trying to eat ice cream or whatever it is they're doing at the time right everybody liked it it was a short time later that aggressive progressive\nMob started to form around the country intimidating lawmakers in public places not just lawmakers you know\nAll kinds of people what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders and\nWe we all know what happened in ... before that it was even worse remember when Steve so we've got shot remember when Rand Paul got tackled than they broke six of his ribs there have been other incidents this has these aren't isolated things that's happened a lot it happened to Lindsey Graham it happened you Jeff Flake although he's not necessarily on our side the mob certainly came for Jeff Flake right now\nBoy this lady I don't think anybody has a cell phone aware as Maxine Waters is after encouraging violence against Republicans Maxine Waters is now suggesting that Donald Trump is the one who's encouraging violence or we haven't power issues which has happened did all the electricity gardener that was so weird right\nNo everybody my headphones that doesn't matter anyway here's Maxine Waters saying that Trump is encouraging violence\nI think the president of the United states\nShould take responsibility for the kind of violence than we're saying oh for the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states has been dog whistling to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there\nI think that the president on there and I had been dog with some folks at Maxine Waters this dog was selling a Donald Trump is dog whistling than what is Maxine Waters doing Maxine Waters is on a megaphone\nTelling people literally on a megaphone standing on a stage telling the crowd to be violent now Donald Trump's doing Donald Trump\nWith all these these these bomb reports today and part of the reason why I didn't start my show today with that is because you're hearing about that everywhere it's I I have Fox News on behind me they're talking about it right now that's all people are talking about today you don't need to hear me tell you that right well there's one sick psychopath out there who\nWhat did you want to prove that he was more a Native American and\nThen uh [laughter] I was with Warren or was that Lindsey Graham I don't know yet a funny line to anyway Chuck Grassley on Thursday referred Julie sweat Nick\nAnd her lawyer Michael ... to the department of ...\nIt's just for a possible criminal investigation over allegations that they made false statements to Congress about Brett\nKavanaugh lady this that's the thing is I don't get to make up the facts I Wish I could I Wish I could make up the facts for you if I could make up the facts this would be a show like everybody in the country has got to get a\nFree ticket today in the mail for tacos no that's not what's happening lady this is this is awfully specific right like do you think she think I even\nHave a horse in this race I'm not a Republican I don't care Brett Kavanaugh as the moderates if Kavanaugh didn't get on to the Supreme Court we would have got Amy Cohen beret and she would have been better no really there is a part of me in the back of my head it bothers the crap outta me it bothers the hell out of me the Democrats\nLeveled these false allegations of ... gets Brett Kavanaugh and that's the only reason why I defended him I'm not a Brett Kavanaugh Republican I don't care about defending Brett Kavanaugh lady oh bless your sweetheart oh Mickey I could count there are ... there are more letters in your first name\n[laughter] than there are I. Q. points for your brain because you're not a smart person Grassley is saying here's what Chuck Grassley said Chuck Grassley and I don't I've never been crazy about Chuck Grassley but he loses his doing if you don't like it lady move to the state where he's from where's he from South Dakota is that we're Chuck Grassley is Romney's from one of the Dakotas\nHe's really into corn and stuff like that um and and [laughter]\nHe has done a fantastic job of trying to get the truth out about what's going on right now uh excuse me Iowa that's what I meant to say not the Dakotas I'm Sorry about that I Want to give the wrong information on the air but I was wrong about he's from Iowa that's what I meant to say not the Dakota so\nAnyway Chuck Grassley saying when a well meaning citizen comes for information relevant to the committee's work I take it seriously\nIt takes courage to come forward it does I agree with him he continues especially with allegations of sexual misconduct or personal trauma here here Chuck Grassley is right about that I'm grateful for those you find that courage Grassley\nContinued but in the heat of partisan moments some do try to knowingly mislead the committee\nYeah like I don't like CPR for example ... yeah I think he did [laughter] I think he did Chuck Grassley continues that's unfair to my colleagues the nominees and others providing information or seeking the truth yeah ... is a potential twenty twenty democratic for gradual connect candidate\nTold CNN the place where I'm reading the story it's not a right wing news outlet it's CNN\nThe communist news network oh Mickey Mickey as going nuts right now and the kind of cheese so angry defending herself\nWhat what what yeah we'll get Chris part my Facebook Live video and look at the comments section it's pure comedy like she thinks I'm making up stories on the air that's not how this works lady I go I get we don't we don't make up facts we find out what\nThe major news outlets are reporting on we tell you that information and then I respond to it and I try to piece together facts and information\nSo I could for my conclusion oh Mickey you're the best part of the show today I really thought when the phone\nJust went down and they're fixed by the way the Folger backup if anybody wants to get it on this seven won three two one two five nine five zero seven when three two one two five nine five zero of anybody wants to get it on this the phones are back up now gradually should still defined folks in the engineering department ... it was a quick\nIt was a quick problem we got real quick now my producer crisis in the comments section this is my Facebook Live videos have turned into nothing short of a of a three ring circus today because I'm starting to attract the kind of people\nI wanted to get I wanted to get people into the show who are libertarians mission accomplished\nAll the libertarians in Houston have been listening to pursuit of happiness radio since it went on the air it's one of the only shows in in Houston that's focused on what libertarians are doing man I wanted to get like the ... the Republicans in America guys we have a lot in common with those guys I Want to I Want to bridge the gap between them I Want to shorten the divide I\nI think we could work with those guys and a lot of ways we have you guys have seen what Rand Paul has done with Donald Trump over the last couple of years it's been fantastic and I want to do the same thing with this radio show but last but not least certainly not least I Want to get the really really cringe worthy laughable progressive trolls to check out my show\nAnd they're doing it [laughter] I [laughter] I had a whole\nNother segment prepared right now but this is infinitely more interesting than that [laughter] oh\nIt's a it's it's too much Ron alright here's what I wanted to talk about what I wanted to talk about was the migrant caravan hey Mickey if you thought I was lying about that news story that I just read from CNN dot com to you where do you hear\nThis Fox News sends a reporter out to the Caribbean now how big is the Caribbean now we know it's at least seven thousand people oh Mickey you're going to have as we know it's at least seven thousand people\nAnd we know that uh the the numbers could maybe be as high as ten people are reporting so big numbers\nI always try to go with the lower side of it is to just say it's at least seven thousand so for the purpose of reporting honestly so people like Mickey out there\nUh you know don't stay up all night are biting their nails over what I've said on the radio today we just like to address things will be truthful and honest with you because that's me I'm a nice guy I'm I like honesty and I like the truth well Fox News sends a guy out today\nI think it was actually yesterday they send a reporter out Chris sent me this new story my producer this happened yesterday right they send a guy out to walk amongst people in the Caribbean and\nAsk them look here's what people are really worried about in America we don't dislike foreigners we want the world's entrepreneur and scientists and doctors and dentists and hardworking law abiding citizens to come to America\nCome here absolutely there's room in America for every one that's not what this is about I'm not like Tom Cotton in Arkansas I don't think that we should seal off the border I don't think we should do that at all um there are places along the border where there's legitimately a human rights crisis happening\nAnd we need to do something about that because people are getting raped and kidnapped tortured and all and worse out there were the cartels and the coyotes control things murder local journalists and pay off police officers look the other way that's a problem right but but similarly this caravan what we're worried about here is the same thing is there's somebody in this caravan\nThat's that's not coming to get asylum that's not a refugee there's there's somebody in the Caribbean\nWho maybe is friendly I must Thirteen or Los Zetas or the Gulf Cartel and they're trying to escape persecution in Central America because they broke the law down there and they figure out we'll go to one of the sanctuary cities in America and will hide out so the Fox news reporter is walking around\nAnd he finds that guy and he asked them what what's the truth either criminals here in this crowd and the guy is a very honest answer those everywhere [noise]\nIs claiming they'll say here I mean it is [noise]\nGuy in the Caribbean is even admitting it they're criminals everywhere they're criminals here there are and that's what he's saying right now for those you that are curious\nAbout that what does it go on to say he goes on to make the point that the five second soundbite what happens after that is always a great question what happens after that as he goes on to make the point but there's also women and children and families there but hidden amongst them are criminals who need to be about it I'm kinda went through junior thanks so much for watching everybody don't pick on Mickey anymore make you

Chris of the\nTV or sees you aren't going\nThe gallery furniture made it American\n\nCivil clue bigger risk jak Callahan Fox News is the director Christopher Wray says a fingerprint or one of the suspicious packages mailed a problem with the Democrats this week ... fifty six year old ...\nAnd then and then the following day said you know what not for me I'm going to go back to whatever I normally do whatever you normally does is apparently a catering here's a catering company called Native American catering and he's part of the seminal tribe which is a group of people\nFrom Florida Native Americans in Florida right anyway so yeah his cousin says he's a lost soul he's the one time stripper in his brain might be melted melted from what steroids he claims steroids ... dream of becoming a professional wrestler according to his cousin\nInstead he found work as a professional stripper well you know hey everyone needs a job no judgment here about the strip or anything\nBut probably mailing fake bombs to people wasn't the brightest idea and that's where our respect for you goes downhill sir I so back in the Nineteen nineties according to an event promoter named Tony Balanchine\nSack was running around the country taking jobs as a stripper well that would imply that he wasn't at one time ... to multiple stripper okay they just mean chronologically in his life he didn't go back to write\nValentine hired him for some stripping jobs in Ohio why oh why oh why oh did he ever leave Ohio I guess to become the mega bomber apparently I don't know anyway so he did a little work in Minnesota I spent some time the Carolinas obviously spent some time in Florida\nI'm his cousin says he couldn't find his niche in life and I guess he found it now back in the nineties he was running around from Minnesota under the Carolinas Florida as he was like a gypsy well I don't know if he's like a gypsy at this point in his life but certainly mailing things around me some might\nHis bombs were gypsy like I guess is the word I'm looking for I he told the examiner Valentine the promoter that is\nHe couldn't remember ... ever abusing drugs but she has been arrested for steroid profession steroid possession anabolic steroids you know the stuff the guys use when their body builders are weightlifters or whatever I uh I wouldn't know I\nMight to me doing exercise it's just kind of jogging around the park by my house in and playing with my phone until I get back\nTo my couch where I can eat potato chips and watch television but I'm the cousin asked not to be identified which kind of makes you wonder like\nThese anonymous sources to the press are are so unreliable but it does appear as though he was a steroid user according to his legal records and also that he was a stripper recording released one person who went on the record and appears as though his cousin\nHas validated some of this information so ah the cousins had that steroids might've affected his brain yeah I think that's probably pretty likely I tell people this all the time\nYou want to drinks a BJ hookers vodka you want to drink a little a Texas giant bourbon is fantastic for you\nYou drink you go to sleep later on you wake up maybe with a little hangover but probably you'll be fine as long as you don't over indulge hey look you fly to what part of the country where it's legal you want to smoke a little weed no judgment here folks but anything involving your nose or your arm you know don't break the law certainly right came we we hear a case here see I\nHave a very strict no needle drug policy that's just one of our policies ... were were were nothing if not against needle drugs and and that's yeah that's definitely one of her she was there any way the cousin said that he's something of a loose cannon he's always been a last saw\nToo many steroids in his day that stuff will melt your brain I tend to agree so what's his political affiliation well unfortunately for people in us on our side you're appears to be a Republican\nHis family was involved in fighting the Communist Party of the Philippines that's interesting right but he is a seminal in Native American Indian as well so I don't know\nMaybe part Philippine or part Native American uh we haven't had a chance to get the DNA results back yet on him but according online records he's registered with a GOP he registered with a GOP in Florida in March twenty sixteen which means he hasn't necessarily\nBeen on the record as a Republican for a very long time at least not necessarily in Florida he's kind of a\nKind of a Johnny come lately appears to have gotten joined up with the flock right before the twenty sixteen election right\nI'm sad goes by Cesar ... on Facebook\nIn case you want to look him up over there it looks like his page has already been taken down yet drawn in there and it's the the Facebook in the federal government are usually pretty quick on these things ah and yeah a lot more information I haven't even gotten to yet he attended a Trump rally in October twenty sixteen\nA Trump bumper sticker CNN bumper stickers all over his car there's so much more

have something to Tom and nobody these are very unexpected October surprises nobody expected the I\nI don't even want to call him the mega bomber but that's what people in the media are calling him and I ... it's certainly going to have at least some effect on the mid term elections just like this caravan is neither of these things were preconceived\nBy anybody in the Democrat or Republican Party at least not as far as we know and yet here we are just less than two weeks away from election day and yeah the the people in this caravan do appear to be pretty dangerous don't they\nWell a lot

Report and everywhere else right now I'm I I certainly did not coined that term that's what they're saying today in the media okay well\nIt's it's new to me that the the bomber situation it is okay if I Want to do something like that I Would do it to number one you're my only two people who will not open their own my own directly\nNumber two you're having\nBombs that don't work hey can you hold that thought we're up against the stop watching or I got to take a quick right don't hang up I'm Ken what's your junior we got\nFull phone lines right now more proceed happiness radio coming up right

RCs\nKnowing that the\n\nOnly state in the nation that can do so\nYour real Texas\nElement we with you\nUsed an sounds good everywhere to Google played it could be or see on my heart radio\n[noise] wow wow well that music tells me were coming back to the break we'll come back\nTo the zoo to happiness radio if you're just tuning in that's where you're at I'm Ken Webster junior and apparently they captured this guy the media calls\nHim the ... bomber but let's call him by his real name Cesar ... his name and I I'm not going to use that name a lot I I I don't feel like this is real different from news coverage\nMass shooting except for a couple of differences um nobody got hurt first of all but the sensationalism and and the constant coverage of this new story is strikingly similar to when there's a mass\nShooting and whenever there's a mass shooting this is one of the few things I agree with people on the left about if you say the suspects name too much\nYou'll start to make some crazy person out there and terrestrial broadcast world saying hey this is how you get famous so I don't want people to think that ah I also don't want to call them the ... so we need to come up with a new name for this guy I don't know Jack leg or ... or something I don't know we need to come up with a name for him\nSo that so that people will know who I'm Talking about um and yeah by the way the guy apparently has a Twitter account up online I'm looking at it right now and uh yeah I'd say it's a lot of stuff on Florida politics or he's not a big fan Andrew Gillum\nOr not surprisingly very surprised me is a steroid user or act steroid use or I don't know what his current drug situation is like spent some time as a stripper catering company his family spent time in the Philippines involved in a fighting militants over there which should have been which\nIs a bit odd right before we went to a break time I wanted you to finish up your point so go ahead why don't you finish your statement sir\nYeah while I was on the thing with the you know the bomber now man these stories are playing out extremely scripted a random in his hand on your speaking about all we do we are less than three hours to capture\nAt all this out on this dude already right exactly and it it the canal personal information you know almost like it's scripted reminds me very much of Timothy McVeigh after the Oklahoma City\nThere were about the first five hours incident that proposal a it was two fellows in a brown camino driving away mhm and then all the\nCaptain was or anti um government here in in support of David ... down in Waco and he went to a gun show all of a sudden boom we are are um you know\nAnd then and then they knew a lot of information about him very quickly and in a good call Tom and\nI and another question that brings up to me is\nHow did this is something one of our listeners just setting the Facebook Live stream or live on Facebook Live right now if anybody feels a little voyeuristic and you want to watch us one of our listeners name Austin in the comments section here just pointed out\nIsn't it weird how this guy was a steroid use a stripper and he was able to get the addresses the personal home addresses of all these high ranking members of the government it's a it's a bit suspicious I mean I\nI I'm Still not sure how I feel about it I Can't wrap my head around the time you want to go see Los Lobos a Muslim the boys\nOh what a week is hey what day of the week is that I don't know yeah we're not really sure yeah I\nDid see a man of\nYeah tell you what I'm gonna put you on hold we'll see if we can keep up with something and they they just so much for the call Tom I'm much jump over here who's been on hold the longest range in DC what's on your mind sir [noise]\nIn a kennel 'em back they're not air coming in\nHey man they said the appreciation of how you doing sir\nI just got back from them you know the president so that\nOh how did it go you met the president that's very interesting\nYeah it was it one way or how I like that way right the first one that you know about the situation with that bomber I don't know anything about it because I never really had to have to look at it you know I was kind of in the White House\nWow how interesting yeah so I just there was a lot of chaos going on over there I\nThought the rope that that would wear but again\nWe're the protesters blaming Trump for the for the bomb scares\nPretty much of core and also the ... and also the fact that it was a young black leaders summit go at the White House why we're so why were you there though I'm ... some kind of what you say\nWait a second rate you called before you're a brother I didn't know that\nYeah oh right on man that's going to just check and I'm just curious right on so so you're there you're for those that are curious how I Know anything about ray rice called before she's a college aged pre law students from taxes and moved up to Massachusetts\nGood for you or a man my hat goes off to your brother that's very cool so so so how much longer you going to be out there for\nA phone call right on man hey while you're in town a\nBand I don't know what the heck did you uh DC I bet I know somebody who doesn't know hang on a second let's jump over here to line five city what would somebody do in DC this time of year it's too late for the cherry blossoms right right\nThey're always so much stuff today that there you can you can never go wrong spending time with the Smithsonian or wandering around the air and Space Museum or the national portrait gallery or something like that but what you really need to do is to tell you to call his mother um I Know his mother\nI Know ray you know where's mom was physically so we're really I never\nHave I Know I Know right uh I never had a couple of Katy or a town hall\nDo you want to go away and I've I met Ray's mom I don't think I don't think you know re but you may have met his law\nYou know what I wanted to re here's what you should do dude here's what you should do rare you still there ray you should go up to the Newseum it's it's like the word museum but\nWith news in it as in like journalism news museum and there is a big controversy there earlier this year they didn't want people to\nUm sell magazine had similar gift shop and they were doing it which is weird because I guess the museum is is ran by a liberal or a Democrat or something but they refused to take their hats down because they set out people are buying I'm we're trying to run a business here you know what I'm saying\nYeah I I remember that but that basically somebody said how can you can eat ban those hats when when we were supposed to support increased speech\nYeah but that's right that's part of yeah that's all free speech it's all it all goes together man the whole ... right I uh I I for one am a ... and\nPretty uh pretty surprised at how crazy today's news cycle has been Sandra there's been no shortage of chaos today a lot that ... took a backseat pretty quick to this new thing with arresting the seminal Native American steroid using stripper fake bomb suspect any reaction to that well\nI'm I think we can call in stripping cater [laughter]\nI think that's great alright milk for for for now I don't know if those are the way having their caterer center just came up with a great idea we're not going to call them the ... bomber on the show for now and he's the stripping cater yeah that's it if you want to call the show and talk about the the so called mad bomber\nI won't pretend like I don't even know what you're talking about this guy's name is the stripping caterer that's it that's you nailed it Sandy there it is right there so so do you think there's any there's more to this than meets the eye or do you think there is another suspect you think there's more bombs out there we don't know about yet well", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018",
