the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com at lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n[noise]\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one version and\nBombs and plug it back\nTo do on the radio show today we've been talking about um\nDifferent aspects of why your life is so mediocre and you know you think about it go like Dell man lay off me\nAnd in my point of view is look if you wanted me to lay off of you you wouldn't listen to the park yeah she really listening 'cause it's caught your attention I Know when I listen to guys that are bombastic and um when I listen to guys that really are way ahead of me financially and\nIt's like they they look back where you're at and they talk about\nYou know I really didn't get it back then I had really figured it out yet I feel that same way at every level at every level of come through\nBeing more and more successful from the very beginning when I quit my job and was able to survive on my single family houses to when I bought my small apartment complexes uh and started learning more and more money than I bought medium size apartments and larger apartment support at every level that I pass through I Want you to understand\nThat every level was an additional learning curve every level created fear\nYou know I I was just scared to buy a single family house was when I started with them\nBut I was just excited the returns that I was getting from those single family houses if you're out there and you're a beginner and you're listening to this big numbers I'd throw around the you know get a religious Thirty years of doing this so it's really not I'm not even proud to throw that out I probably should have ten times more money than what I have I just wasn't that aggressive\nUm but if you're back they're starting where I started out where most people start at is that you and you've got to get out there and you've got to just change your mind you need to self educate yourself that's the most important thing\nAnd then you need to start thinking about your family's wealth as a business and not think about your family's money as little bill is college fund for get little Billy if you're a millionaire by the time Billy goes to college don't you think you can afford to send Billy to college\nDon't save for college by in a bar with complex and make enough money in that apartment complex can not only make you rich for pay his way through college\nWhen he's done with college you'll still have the apartment complex you still have the income and it'd be worth even more so get rid of the little Billy college fund\nGet rid of the um the ... retirement but you don't need a retirement fund you don't need a pile of money sitting there doing nothing for you to die with\nOr to rather live off before you die you need investments what you need to do is replaced short earned income with past week I'll get that money out of the four one K. get it out of the IRA\nDopey uh Dave Ramsey fool and pay off your home get the money out of your personal house that money could earn you enough money to retire on what is the house do anyway sheet rock carpet and paid it's nothing you can live anywhere\nBut what you can't do is replace your income if you don't have any\nMoney to invest you need to get out there and get the money that you have invested you need to think about your family as a business what is your business your family's business producing is it producing anything yes or no if it's not producing why\nWhy are you letting it you're the c._e._o. of your company will sit down at dinner tonight and go okay family\nI had a paycheck this month maybe mother had a paycheck this month I'm and we're in twelve cents on our savings go but dead why do we have any other passive income I listen to this crazy do once in the radio and many other people why is that we don't have any passive income well son\nI'm scared I'm stupid I'm lazy\nIt's got to be one of the three easier too scared to try you're too stupid to figure it out even with all the education that's out there or you're too lazy to even get up and dry it's\nGotta be one of the three so tell your kids shut down tonight at the dinner table and tell your kids kids I'm either too stupid too lazy\nOr to do do stupid too lazy what was the other one that I'm not going to get this thing done period\nThat's all there is to I'm not going to do it for us I'm going to let you guys grow up and be just like me work for the rest of your life from age twenty four age Seventy eight eighty years old now\nI'm not going to help you I'm not going to teach you how to make money I'm not going to build the families well do you think about\nGeneration after generation what are the things I wanted to bring up with something you don't even see that's mortgage reduction\nThat's another way we make money I remember getting excited about it that when I had a lot of property so I don't remember exactly how many properties ahead but I was looking at a situation where I was making a hundred thousand dollars a year in mortgage reduction five hundred thousand your mortgage reduction at the peak when I was a lot of problems I think maybe had like a hundred or a a\nI'm Sorry a million dollars with a mortgage production principle direction and you don't see that million bucks or that five hundred thousand or even that ten or twenty whatever you're earning whatever you're paying down you don't see it but it's\nTo get out your balance sheet each month ago while the mortgages down the value is up my equity is up do you look at do you have financial statements do you have a balance sheet do you ever resume\nDo you have a list of old your investments you look at I look at them three or four times a month\nAs different payments come in each time a paper that comes to like go back to my calculations I keep track of how much are burning at all my passive income investments to the to the penny each month I compare them I could eat them I tried to make them better every month\nI keep track of all my earned income that or I Try to make that better all of my business income I Try to track all but I Do track all my business\nThen I put them all together in one giant spreadsheet where I have\nAll of my businesses all of my or to start with or to go the business income that interest income than a rental income\nAdam altogether and that's my total income for the bulk slash total income if you're a tracking your results like that every month\nNot

definitely going to be getting to the bomb stuff and the care of and stuff coming up\nDon't worry we're covering all of it there's no doubt about that we have to discuss it but first\nHave to discuss this Houston's chief of police\nAt me [laughter] I Know it's not it's not what you expected to hear who can Webster junior producer catty when he's such a nice guy have you met his wife she's so pretty how could how could he have upset the chief of police well it's what happened on the show yesterday and\nAn op ed that I wrote that was part of it I wrote something that was critical of the chief of police and he's not used to being criticized by conservatives are members of the political right the conservative news media you know I'm vaguely a conservative I'm really a libertarian that's what this is so when I see the chief of police getting political\nAt a you know what well out doing his job bugs me a little bit so what's the story that's probably what you're wondering right now you are probably wondering that and I'm gonna tell you the whole story yesterday I read a brief op ed on the air I talk just a little bit about some of the chief of police that I described art Acevedo as a notable Democrat\nNFO social justice warrior and Houston police but in fact how I started a very short ... just to highlight the fact that he did something silly on Twitter\nNotable Democrat info social justice warrior Houston police chief art Acevedo\nReally seems to dislike Republicans I mean he just it's kind of obvious that he doesn't like conservatives this is the same guy who after the Santa Fe shooting came out and said hey\nMaybe we need more gun control dude you're a cop do you really think that the answer to America's problems right now is more gun control when troubles at your door even the best police officers out there twenty minutes away I got nothing but love and respect for for the boys in blue if you're a beat cop if you're out right now on the street looking for bad guys trying to stop crimes\nPerhaps to you producer Kenny salute you Ken Webster junior producer Chris all of us here nothing but love for those guys seriously I Know what it feels like to be a victim of a of a violent crime I Know what it feels like to get punched it a political rally I Know what it feels like to get surrounded by an angry mob I'm no stranger to that I get it\nI understand better than anybody as well as anybody I shouldn't say better than it so that better than anyone in the world no no I'm not going to exaggerate I'm a politician no but realistically here I I certainly know what it feels like to be in that situation sucks it's very a very unfortunate thing well earlier this week on Twitter art Acevedo posted some photos\nOf a small crowd of anti Trump protesters at the Trump rally\nVery small crowd and its him posing for pictures of them multiple photos of the Trump ... do you don't know what the Trump balloon is it's a big orange would how would you what did you call it a blimp like the kind of thing you see on the Macy's day parade except a little smaller I don't know if this is big enough for a parade ...\nIt's a parade balloon right that's how my producer Chris describes it it's a\nIt's not exactly a it's not exactly I mean it's not a floats I Know you guys get it you know what I'm Talking about right we've all seen this thing it was in England and then they brought it overseas to here I guess he was following Trump around when he was in London a while back\nThat balloon it's him in a diaper it's the president in a diaper meant to look like a chubby baby with blonde Chester I get it from a cartoon standpoint it's very funny it's clever\nBut our chief of police as posing for photos with it not just posing for photos posting them on Twitter posting them on Twitter dude you posted the photos on\nTwitter and that was all you post it was that hey down here at the rally in any and then he gave a little remark with a tweet here here's the thing he said he said we're about Thirteen thousand inside Toyota Center with room for five or six thousand more you know damn well what he's trying to say he's trying to say that it's not really that many Trump supporters\nWhat else what else would have meant from that if that's\nNot absolutely obvious slapped me in the face right now with I don't know what are some brisket I'm hungry but then he continues uses thank you all who are working with Houston police in our partners to keep everyone say I'm with you on that ... I agree with you\nAnd then he says we will be deployed until everyone leave safely hash tag\nHash tag relational policing that must be his new thing hash tag relational policing as anybody else using that hashtags but him well yesterday I I sent out short out that it's a few paragraphs long it's a few sentences I just wanted you guys to know about this\nAnd the the story caught on thousands have you read the article and thousands of you shared it on social media we can see the analytics for these things I'm not bragging it's just a story it's something that happened\nThis is a tiny little radio show you guys get that right on that Rush Limbaugh I'm not walnut Johnson and I'm not Sean Hannity I'm not Michael berry I'm not going back I'm not marked with Ben I'm a millennial I'm a this is a small show with one affiliate it's our our flagship I guess you would call it\nWhat regional program just talking to liberty minded people in southeast Texas and we have an opinion about this\nThe chief of police user is using his platform to slam Republicans kind of tacky in the middle of a Republican political rally so he replies\nTo one of the posts on Cape here she radios\nA Twitter account follow them unwind by the way at CPR she radio dot com\nExcuse me I came here see radio sorry for ... years Iraq on the Web site at Cape here see radios are Twitter cow by the way anybody sitting on

this off I just\nI got to get this on my chest like the blonde chest hairs on that Donald Trump ... so chief art Acevedo replies to the to the article and he says\nIs this an editorial or fact well which part genius of the part where I'm Talking about what you did or the part where I'm giving my opinion it's ... it's posted on a blog if that's not obvious enough what it is\nRight I'm not I'm not the Houston Chronicle he continues he says um [noise] I\nPersonally spent the entire day with our men and women ensuring the rally went off without a hitch for ... rally goers and protesters\nGreat so where's the photo of you with high ranking members of the Republican Party shaking their hands where's the photo well while you're pointing out that there could have been more people at the rally why don't you give us the number of the total tally on protestors out there what you're saying and what you're not saying combined together equals my analysis of you art Acevedo and I don't have a problem with you man seriously\nI just have a problem with one thing that you did is this not obvious he continues he goes we posed for many photos with attendees untreated photos capturing the entire essence of the event lie hash tag relational policing that's\nThat's what he says that's what he's talking about give me a break dude if art Acevedo is out there listening which I Know he's not he's a Democrat it certainly doesn't listen to this channel give us a call and and if and I'd love to know what the rest you think about this as well\nSeven when three two one two five nine fifty just like

are opinionated ended up with an objective and want to ask questions\nI'm that's what we're looking for we're looking for people in the audience they want to interact and want to be on the air so definitely certainly interested in that if you are and now if you're not on Facebook maybe you're you don't like the uk that's fine if you're not down with Mark Zuckerberg\nHit me up on Twitter same thing I'm One of the few people in the media I keep my DMZ open do you know what I'm saying like you can direct message me even if I don't follow you for those that don't use Twitter that probably sounded like like Dutch or something but to those that are into Twitter in many of you are I think there's at least fourteen thousand of our listeners following me on Twitter\nUm Fifteen thousand now excuse me just go ahead and direct message me and again this is during a work day so I get that not everybody can be there that's why I'm doing it this way instead of having people call us up direct message me either on Twitter or Facebook and I will start you out let's get to some calls\nPeter you and I spoke on social media earlier if I'm not mistaken Mrs ... if you're the St Peter that I think this is and you had a weird experience at a polling station here in the Houston area right\nYes I did tell me a little bit about what happened to you\nWhat happened was that one and this morning to go early vote and when I get there and I'm you know handing them lie I bought\nMy voting registration card and my driver's life um was\nNormally handed boxing and um my uh my CDL concealed though\nOh totally totally valid form of id and the state of Texas just absolutely you're not a problem you can use your ideal yeah\nSo I had a book to the poll worker there and she went and swipe my CDL just like you do with a driver's license because they look so much alike they're there sometimes hard ... hard if you don't take a double book out so she swiping boats and handed me back my CDL as well and like my voter registration card you know get a\nMr Gray whatever like Emily what I Know she's still ever addressed I'd never heard\nA second your name's not Greg it's Peter tried I think I'm starting to understand the point of this story okay go on\nAnd I say I say excuse me and she said the name again you're still up this address I just need to change that for what you vote I said no wow he goes ... which is that's not you know 'cause that's not your address you\nChange addresses but that's not even me and I hand or my uh my feet or I didn't realize that Celia ... swiped again yeah if the house we I go to not for me she as I said hold on you know that's my yeah let me any my driver's license fat or animal drives the shit oh is that your alias\nThe other one has a page says everything\nAnd the guy sitting next to ... lead over a you know he ended up over here and this is not for you because oh egos he is the the L database all messed up springing up all night\nLong wow and so that's a federal thing um so it sounds like what it sounds like it's happening here is they have the same card swipe or that they're using for ... for for a license to carry your CDL cards that they're used for driver's licenses and it's confusing the system is that kind of is that the gist of what's happening\nThat's exactly what happened if I had spoken up I could have just what voted the other guy stuff came back while you're on to another station then and voted last all got out to vote there\nI Do find it really kind of crazy I don't think there's anything done maliciously right I just\nFind it odd that has not been looked at and even with this other coworkers now that I'm you know the the fact that he knew was\nPulling up the wrong thing and everything right I just got to make the question how how really tensions but you know the whole system\nYou have raised point just the very fact that you experienced this Peter first of all I commend you\nOn trying to be a trying to call them out on us being a whistle blower unlike a sign of it's probably not is probably not a scandal or a scam but it certainly is a government fluke and this is a big gaping hole in our national security right now if this is true if what Peter saying is true and it sounds she sound sincere to me it just it sounds like a real story to me\nThat would mean that anybody listening to me right now with my voice in KPMG does not encourage you to do this\nCould go out with your CDL card and trick a local pollster who didn't appear to even look at the card before telling Peter that his name was bragging proceeding to tell them you can go vote\nThat's a big problem now think about this for a second\nThe fact that this is an issue right now and if this is true really speaks to the inadequacy of government these the same people\nWho think that guy who thinks that voter fraud is not a problem also want the government to control our health care and they want to take our guns away because they think that we could protect ourselves that we can be protected by exclusively by local law enforcement and oh by the way the government needs to regulate the economy as well\nIf what Peter is saying is true and it sounds like this is really what happened to him [laughter] I it just speaks once again to the ... of the government the government should not be relied upon for all of our basic needs in this in this world", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "24"}
