Republican\nThere just Democrats in disguise\nAnd that that was rife among the right and it looked like they were never going to be able to get on the same page but now they won yeah the Republican candidate became president and they seem to be\nLike I said a\nLittle bit more unified cut to the left is now dealing with his own factions of extremism saying that do you know ... you're nowhere near left enough case in point the antifa folks the anti fascist types\nWhat was that rally was one in Portland I think it was the unite the white rally where a bunch of antifa types beat the living ... not out of a Bernie Sanders supporter\nFor not being left wing enough us poor guy poor guy went to and ... and again we talked about this on the show when it happened but if you don't remember the story this poor guy went to\nThis rally to protest\nRight wing extremism or something like white supremacist nonsense some we can knuckle dragging you will not replace us more on getting together I think it was in Portland and he showed up staunch Democrat Bernie supporter with his American flag\nAnd to him the American flag was a symbol of unity and hope\nAnd in some ways he was sort of taken aback I suppose\nFelt as though the American flag and been appropriated by people that were hateful and wanted to make sure that people knew that folks on the left we're proud to be American as well what a novel concept\nThere are some antifa protesters there doing what they do demanded his flag he was like well no you can't have my ... my ... and I'm not going to get the whack people eating snot out of this guy took his flag and left him bleeding on the ground\nThe antifa folks beat the crap out of a Bernie Sanders supporter because he wasn't lefty enough\n\nMaybe maybe it does go hand in hand with last maybe the division goes hand in hand with loss when Obama was president the right we're blaming each other because they lost again two terms in a row uh jeeze\nMust be your fault must be your fault oh wait are guy one where we can all get along again and I guess that would logically dictate that people on the left\nI last well they would start looking around for people to blame I mean there's tremendous division still between Bernie Sanders supporters and Hillary Clinton supporters and there's so many Bernie\nBoosters that will tell you that Bernie Sanders would be president if Hillary Clinton was in such a dirty cheating scoundrel and all this sort of stuff like there's still plenty of that to go around\nI guess it's the loss that brings the division\nI don't know I Do notice though is tremendously disappointing time where we are so divided not just among ourselves left and right ... but when people within their own parties can't get on the same page\nIt's sad\nBecause ultimately we're on the same side and the seeds of division that exist between us whether it's between left and right or left not left enough or right not write enough\n[noise] you know who they held not us\nThey help the enemies of America they held the Kim Jong is in the ... and folks like that who are looking for some higher ground an upper hand in these situations\nWho are looking to play us who are looking to get the better of us whether it comes in the form of trade or in the form of weaponized singer Dee weaponized saying\nThis is why this is why a lot of the dissent over that last jet I'm movie being too left leaning a lot of the online dissent was signed by the Russian bots\n\nThere is genuine currency to our enemies and our division the more we fail to get along the more we quibble and argue about whether or not the rock is black enough to play a black person\nThe more we argue about these things the more we are divided the more we let ourselves be divided about these indulgence ... the indulgences these things that don't really matter the more we play into the hands of our enemies I don't know how many more times I have to say it I don't know how many more ways I can say it\nBut I keep saying it because it's so important so important for you for me for all of us\nSomewhere at some point we managed to get on the same page [noise]\nThank you

of has to do with online streaming the world of online streaming music this is actually something that liberals are very happy about and yet at the same time they refuse to get Republicans credit for it Brock Obama and the Democrats were in charge of the political party for very long time\nI mean they were charged with the federal government for very long time for two thousand eight right up until I mean you can really argue right up until like the last two years of Obama's time in office the Democrats had a real grip on what was happening in Washington DC at the time in during that time\nIt

recording artist studio musicians and they're really excited about this people that work in Nashville and Chicago and Los Angeles I've talked to many of them off the record off the air\nThey they

people die from it every year\nThat's too many people except the death rate has been going down how long have how quickly is going on well for the last Thirty years about the same time as these climate hysterics got going about the planet eating out\nIn Nineteen Ninety the death rate worldwide for malaria was fourteen point two percent a per one hundred thousand people\nAnd in twenty sixteen that rate has fallen by about forty percent a nine point seven per one hundred thousand what changed well he wasn't the un screeching about climate change for starters between World War two and Nineteen sixty five malaria was managed by spraying of incest decide DDT or taking climbing\nIf you happen to contract it however due to some extremely overblown environmental concerns DDT was was banned\nFor more on that see Rachel Carson's Silent Spring ... it's a story for another time but new medicines and incest decides and the use of insecticide treated bed nets became more popular side note here for you folks one of the most effective programs to date to stop new infections is former President Bush number forty three charting a charity a\nCharity charity excuse me\nThey made sure almost every school kid in Africa had new bed nets so thank you very much Republicans none of these new medicines and says decides or even sterile mosquito intervention programs were driven by the un or local governments they all came from the blessings of capitalism either directly from companies were from charities like President Bush is\nAnd you know the statistics that show the U.S has\nLed the way and reducing greenhouse gas emissions yeah those didn't happen because of the un mandated either those reduction happened because alternative energy sources like natural gas and clean coal became cheap and affordable and the government didn't develop those technologies\nGuest guest what system gave it to us\nCapitalism so let's all quit\nEating meat and become social service it's it's the only way to save the planet just ignoring the people dying for malaria and ignore all the facts and evidence and listen to what the outcome is at the un say because as history has shown they have

having a little bit of a doo doo problem San Francisco is now officially the due to the capital of America\nBut what does this mean it means\nMaybe it's anything but a San Francisco trade one of the most beautiful cities in the country has turned into a dumping ground for burial bowel movement some things have gotten so bad that California city is now dubbed the due to the capital of America\nYeah the new nickname comes courtesy of the apartment search service ... which said the city of the highest amount of complaints about fecal matter on sidewalks anywhere in America\nAnd and part of the reason why we don't have that problem in Houston I ... I mean well for one thing we don't encourage homeless people to move here are the way they do in San Francisco but also nobody nobody walks here\n[laughter] but seriously though I Walk sometimes I like to go for a little runs sometimes burn off some of my beer beer ... as as a a pounds is what I'm trying to save up the beer belly and when I'm Out running around I don't really see people on the sidewalk taking a big old duty like they do in San Francisco\nAnyway this data was compiled by the website it shows four hundred and fifty nine point eight nine poop sightings reported per square mile and twenty Seventeen [noise] God per square mile per square mile you're telling me you walk around for a mile and you'll see human feces four hundred and fifty five boys eight nine times\nOut of\nThe worst neighborhoods in San Francisco for waste complaints from humans and animals were Golden Gate park south of marketing tenderloin uh you don't have to live in that area to understand that those are Golden Gate park I mean you get with that is right it's in places where the yuppies want to live\nI mean while they did want to live [laughter] I don't know if they do now San Francisco has year long comfortable with either\nIn a very large homeless population doesn't get that hot there in the summer doesn't get that cold there in the winter that's why people like San Francisco well out of the seven thousand four hundred Ninety nine homeless people recorded last year about fifty eight percent or four thousand three hundred and fifty three people were marked as on sheltered\nThe other three thousand one hundred forty six were designated sheltered so they had a place to go they had a place to go yeah I'm a sidewalk but on bump [laughter]\nA poor San Francisco in the meantime all we can do when we hear about a news story like this\nIs just sit back and\nSo if you invested in something overnight while the market was down you made money today\nA lot of people are probably wondering well what does this mean it's been a while the week for socks initially lower than expected consumer price index or that the CPI data interest rates lower than stocks higher in early trading yesterday before stocks part those games and took another poor\nBut this this is actually pretty common in in October one market or you shouldnt fear market volatility and October\nOctober should be known for volatility has no mom has seen more one percent changes for the U.S will be five hundred index going going back to Nineteen fifty than than October ... there has to be five hundred actually had\nOne of its least of all it's all third quarters in history and it's gone Seventy four consecutive days without a one percent move\nI mean I don't want to bore all you guys with all the information you're my only point is that don't worry about the stock market just don't just look wait a couple of weeks wait until November and then look at how your portfolio is doing don't worry about it it's not worth worrying about keep investing your you're making the right move back\nTo them or something on pursuit of happiness radio [noise]\nIn my humble opinion we'll be right back or sent over the last six years I'm Mark ... review the consumer affairs daily brave at Amazon dot com today is\nAlexa flaky pie or see on ... radio [noise]\nWhat show is at its pursuit of happiness radio it's friday morning there just waking up greetings welcome to friday\nThe weekend is almost here hope you had an awesome week I Hope you have an awesome weekend\nI I Know I'm going to I got some friends in town this weekend uh when my wife does but her friends are my friends I Love my wife and I love all her friends are all great people\nThere is actually what is it called the art of whining and dining is a big festival going on this weekend in sugar land to those that live outside Houston I I don't want to bore you with details I won't go too far into details on this but my wife has a very good friend who is one of those dueling piano people and they do\nThey're very funny they do Elton John and then they do will John so it's like classic rock\nAnd then hip hop and they're playing it on piano while they sing and wrap along with music it's very entertaining\nI I I I really encourage you guys to come out this weekend I Will be there I I'm not being paid to support this it's just something I'm looking forward to doing it's going to be in sugar land looks like it's going to be a lot of fun I like having fun don't you I like having fun 'cause sometimes in these in this day and age political correctness has never been more confusing just navigating through\nThis world wind up complicated rules the leftist created for us about what we can and can't do that might offend people\nIt used to be the algae Beatty movement right lesbian gay by transgender and then it got more complicated they added a cue and then they added a pie and then they added a an end for non gender\nAnd I am I'm almost elected to criticize us because I don't have a problem with gay people I don't if you're gay if that's what makes you happy look I'm not gay I met headed that way but if that's where you go for it I have I have always had a problem with the conservative stance on gay marriage\nI mean let me put that in different terms I've always had a problem with the government stance on gay marriage on gay marriage and I still do the government shouldn't be in the business of selling marriage licenses\n... before when gay marriage was was illegal or when it wasn't a when it wasn't legalized\nWhen it wasn't recognized by the government and today when it is I have a problem with both of those sets of laws I Know that ... confuses some people but but again let me just repeat what I just said the government should not be in the business of selling marriage licenses our marriage licenses as a share property contracting a will essentially it's a it's a loose\nIt's loose pretense for a while if you're married and you die and you don't have a well\nThen they probably give all your stuff your spouse I think that's how it works in most states right and similarly\nIf something happens to you or your spouse has some some legal authority over what happens to your body if you're in a coma that kind of thing but all that stuff could be determined without the government you just need a contract the wheel of a lot just get an attorney hire a lawyer\nYou know we say that we have lawyers and and and often is the case that I Do dislike lawyers but lawyers at least\nHelp us navigate our way through the complicated legal system\nI mean there are at least a handful of good lawyers out there\nFor every one is exploitation of there's somebody out there was good intentions anyway I kinda got off subject here\nBy my only point is that it's getting more and more confusing these days to navigate your way through the algae Beatty cue RA you know what I mean like\nLike what's the role as it can I just say algae beaches cue or do I have to put the IRA [noise] how many letters do we need a lot of letters\nOr are they say they are here though\nIs none of the\nSun and ways failed out all this in their words\n... well ...\n... is there a way it is the case they lose I'm also in a\nZ that then\nIn the late ... same even making names you ran in saying they go to jail gee they are\nBasically were gay solid in different ways feels\nTo get married any day\nAnd will they scream in their ... and I\nReally matter\nLevels of work that was the one\nWe know you're out there\nHiding

he's against forced state mandated manual labor which is what the causes\nIn the thirteenth amendment about the punishable called that's right yeah right and what this is is there is a causing the thirteenth amendment that basically says some forms of someone does something the state doesn't approve of\nThat could still be a slave they could still be sold technically I mean that's where it's kind of a gray area from a legal perspective and there were some there were some um [noise] there were some things that happened during the twentieth century and the Supreme Court the challenge for these things but then there was another law passed in Nineteen Seventy to kind of did away with such\nSo there's a lot of complicated issues involving the thirteenth amendment and what kind of us said wasn't wasn't wrong now since this news story broke so much has happened so many people have come out and said that\nYou know he's the he's the house and we're ... it's a minstrel show these are
