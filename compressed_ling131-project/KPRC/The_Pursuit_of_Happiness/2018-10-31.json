hate crimes\nBehind closed doors they use the word it was\n... that was the word right I'm In Chris very nervous you know I'm not going to swear on the air credits for it [laughter] I get paid too much money to give up his job and no no no in all seriousness though the um the the thing that is the most pressing especially over the last couple of weeks\nNobody saw this coming immigration has become one of the forefront issues here in American politics did\nNot see that coming I look up at myself for the camera and see myself wearing the the blinds grow mascot it's hard for me to take myself seriously so I'll put it on later I well Chris I promise I'll put it on in a little bit but what type of serious conversation here for a little bit because I Can't talk about this next news story while I'm wearing a silly mascot I'll never be able to run for office\nAlready just 'cause of all the ridiculous videos of me on the Internet but one thing I cannot do is where a a blind ... as I have this conversation on the air right now because this is serious the border patrol is were warning Texas landowners\nAbout possible armed civilians in the area due to this caravan it's a report we do know that this is necessarily happening yet but there is this scare this growing concern\nThat militias are going to show up at the border with guns and try to go to war with the Caribbean All right so why would they do that what what would make people think the Caribbean could be this dangerous or this concerning well for one thing there was a shooting involving the caravan yesterday they throw him out\nTop cocktails they shot a police officers again this is not everybody in the Caribbean just as we're not talking about\nEvery little inch of the border when we talk about the border problems I'm not talking about every person in the Caribbean but there were shootings in this past week just yesterday as a matter of fact there was a report out about a shooting between police officers and a couple of members of the caravan proportionately they were all apprehended they were arrested thank God\nThat could have been much worse um and then the top cocktails being thrown down\nBy the border of Guatemala you you've also seen this video of people charging at the border gates coming into the southern border of Mexico trying to rip it down and it looks insane so the first time I saw that video I didn't think it was real I thought to myself there's no way that this is something that just happened somebody is sending me a video\nFrom the middle east and it just kinda vaguely looks like Mexico so it's misleading no that was Mexico that was Guatemala that was Central America scary frightening to think\nThat's what's coming here right now so as that's happening\nThe border patrol has received reports that militias are heading to the border now if you happen to be a part of a militia if you're part of it are militia I don't have a problem with that but my advice would be don't go to the border\nIt's not going to make things any better this is just my two cents this isn't like a Cajun Navy kind of situation\nWhere we need civilians help now it's just going to complicate things the national ... on National Guards already down there and the border patrol I Want to know what you guys think about this maybe you disagree with what I just said call to show right now seven on three two one two five nine five zero we'll be right back\nIn pursuit of happiness radio\nPong KP RC nine fifty\nYes [noise] do you don't juice I Love this music is just so fun you're too old to remember how big of a deal this movie was kind of remembers my producer crafts he he seemed beetle juice who has this is an American classic but at the time we didn't know a few things first of all we didn't know that the little girl in the movie\nWinona Ryder was going to grow up and become a thief right wasn't that are things you like to shoplift she got a lot of trouble it kind of hurt her career and then we also didn't know that the guy who plays the dad\nOn in the movie be it'll juice also I guess he is he also the principal and Ferris wheel or stay off can huge fat check that for me 'cause I had to get this wrong and he got into trouble because\nHe had a what did he have child porn or something I hate to give the wrong information on the air but he\nThere's a reason you don't see that guy and movies any more so when we were all watching beetles use as a little kid we had no idea that there was a huge hit Tim Burton I think it was it was not the first movie he did his directorial debut is ... big adventure but you could see some similarities if you watch if you ever see 'em on cable\nI nobody knew what Tim Burton was when the ... big adventure came out but when you saw the movie\nYou know it's it's iconic to what Tim Burton did and then later on timber and ended up working with a bunch of weirdos anyway I'm kinda left your junior its pursuit of happiness radio ... coming up open phone line seven one three two one two five nine five zero I Know it's something you were thinking it's a Halloween show I mean ... is a great author did I get it right Christ is that what happened to me I thought so\nI didn't actually she was a fantastic author of fantastic filmmaker a great speaker but what does he have to do with Halloween spook key to Nashville sous oh no no no he's got a new film death of a nation it's a it's it's been out in the theaters for a little bit but now it's coming to the ... it's coming to DVD so now you can finally watch it at home if you haven't seen it yet and it's a fantastic movie I mean\nEven if you don't agree with his politics he makes a really great movies it's ... it's very interesting very engaging well put together and\nHe just kind of scary movie I mean if you consider some of the stuff that left us are capable of it's a bit frightening anyway we've been talking about the care of and I got to take the bait or for those watching me on Facebook Live right now if you're wondering what I'm doing here in the studio and I and I over a hundred of you are watching right now this is my this is my ... blind squirrel costume\nIn the Supreme Court if he does what he says he's going to do and it seems like he is going to do what he says he's got to do now there is a very interesting hero in all of this and I'm using the term hero loosely here we used to refer to this guy as Lindsey Graham misty I Know some of your scratching your head right now going I Can't believe you just said that and some of the worst that could yourselves yeah I I\nLindsey Graham is kind of the unexpected a saving grace in this controversy Lindsey Graham's plan\nIs that he wants to introduce legislation to end birthright citizenship so this is actually what we need we need somebody in the Senate or somebody in the house of representatives\nTo write a bill and get it to pass in both houses of Congress and then get the president to sign it and if we can do that we could get rid of birthright citizenship but there's just one problem with doing that right remember the whole reason why we're having this conversation and the first place the caravan\nWhat does this do to stop the Caribbean it does nothing to stop the caravan if somebody is pregnant right now and they're on their way to America maybe it would stop their child from becoming a citizen you know several months down the road once they gave birth here but that's not what's happening\nThese people in the Caribbean or not illegal or by the basic definition of a law they're just not illegal immigrants because they're coming to seek asylum so we have to get rid of birthright\nCitizenship but it's a nice start but we've also got to get rid of the refugee activists ... of the mid twentieth century and without doing that we continue this revolving door letting people come into the country and get citizenship when maybe they shouldn't be don't change the channel coming up to Nashville Sousa plus your calls several in three two one two five nine five oh we'll be right back [noise]\n\nPursuit of happiness radio [noise]\nDoesn't [noise] [noise]\n\nYes [noise] this is a this is rock well right is that what this is called okay so this is Barry Gordy sunrise so it's a funny thing about this we're doing Halloween themed bumper music today just in our program director requested that she's in the control those right now ah\nMichael Jackson sings the chorus on this song right but this other otherwise this guy was a one hit wonder like how depressing to have Michael Jackson hunter song to do so well [noise]\nThat's right because Barry Gordy was his dad that's why he was on his arm anyway ah\nI Can't I Want to sit around and listen to somebody's watching me all day long and dance\nAround to it but we have a fantastic best on hold and some people might think of themselves what is this just have to do with Halloween I mean he's a fantastic speaker he's one of my favorite speakers authors and filmmakers a lot of you have seen his new movie this year already called death of the nation but ... isn't scary he's a nice guy what does he have to do with Halloween\nTo measure you there I hear\nYa I'm good how are you doing sir what are you going as for Halloween this year the listeners the listener's want me to ask you I didn't want to ask\nYou well you know I I Wish I had my caught him read 'em and uh but uh I'm you know I don't know about them to come out\nEither these days in a band at our front door and a handout Andy\nI'm looking at play the role of the other side it let everybody out ...\nWell that's okay I was a I was dressed a few minutes ago as Baitullah works blind squirrel but I wanted to be the consummate professional for this interview\nSo I took my blind squirrel cost them off to talk to the next as soon as I did actually very excited about this about this movie coming out on DVD I Know that a lot of people are reluctant to go out to the movie theaters I think a lot of our listeners are interested in you but they're not interested in supporting commercial theaters\nSo this gives them a rare chance to watch them we must not rare it's predictable we all knew it would come out on DVD but this gives them a chance to watch it at home does that make sense\nYeah I Know it's really great and movie habit shifting a lot of people or to watch at home and they do it either by getting physical BP which you can get obviously in red Foxx but Walmart\nYou can also digitally downloading green light you in the movies available and all the platform and the book of the same title in the book\nThe book is outstanding the movies even better I think uh\nIt's it's a really interesting movie it's just it's well produced it's entertaining even if you don't agree with those positions and I know most of our listeners definitely do it's still fun to watch the national movies they're just well done but then as you know the the hot topic at the moment and then we got to get to that everybody's talking about the caravan everybody's talking about the birthright citizenship topic\nYou came here as an immigrant who came here legally you're a citizen you've had some ups and downs as a citizen you spent some time in prison you got pardon by the president how does how does an immigrant such as yourself react to all this news\nWhile I arming a car or coal more tending like low on your own question and one of the blame language if the ... amendment\nIt basically talked about citizenship applying to people who are living under the jurisdiction of the United states now that doesn't mean that if you will immigrant or you have to we can hold a citizen that permanent resident here legally\nAnd they have a child I don't think there's any doubt that that child is under current law\nA bit of the United states the question becomes if you have to people who ... on law and have a child that that child become automatically admitted in the corner never today that question and Congress right it is an open question\nYeah and it absolutely is yeah I Know his executive order would naturally change anything but Lindsey Graham of all people a former member of the gang of eight are a lot of uh a lot of diehard conservatives called him Lindsey Graham misty to mock him she's actually a guy who's who's come out and said he's drafting a bill\nAnd he wants to change birthright citizenship do you think\nFirst of all do you think this has any chance of passing and I like I said there's a lot to do with what happens in midterms this next week but I ... Lindsey Lindsey Graham too little too late or or does he have a chance of of actually changing the system here\nWell I think what's interesting is that a Trump is clearly defending the buying of the Republican Party and be that he put like ... and all of them\nAre these people who have become the heart and profit partly by the mission that the other side the left has become gangs allies the only thing is that the fundamental protection of things like each\nOther and the other thing is from the fight back on the nation that behavior of the other side and then that Republicans strength an accent when a is motivating them people on the Republican side\nWell put ... absolutely well put your book or talked about almost ... ... a lot of the things that are happening in America right now this connection between fascism\nAnd left us um and and ah you know the bullying of people when you don't agree with their policies use force to try to get them to change their positions they do work supporters chasing Heidi crews out of a restaurant and you know just just the other day Donald Trump goes\nTo offer a a a little bit of of love and support for these people at the synagogue\nThe rabbi says yes I Want Donald Trump to come here all are welcome including the president he's my president local Democrat leaders actors no Donald Trump doesn't belong there and then just like the Westboro Baptist church these people show up to protest a prayer vigil", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "31"}
