thing I quit drinking pretty much on my Eighteenth birthday\nI drank heavily from the ages of Thirteen to Amy\nAnd once it became legally represented know rebellion to me it represented conformity I decided just wasn't something I Want it in my life so I quit drinking but [noise]\nThings are very different and I think they still are in England with regard to underage drinking\nLike I'm the same height now I was when I was Thirteen so I used to go to bars and easily passed for Eighteen and I wasn't id but I Do remember one time when I was a Fifteen year old drunken kid at a bar in London and [noise]\nThe waitress came up to me it was like hey hey hey how old are you and I forgot what the drinking age was because I was drunk and Fifteen I was like that I'm a\nSeventeen that's the thing right I'm Seventeen and she was like hey hey hey the drinking age is Eighteen so you finished that want to know more for you [noise]\nBut yeah I went to concerts with this buddy of mine in high school

beers were in plastic cups\nSo there wasn't grievous bodily harm happening it was a terrible thing to do by drunken logger loud says we called them in England like to throw beer at other people on

the questions people were throwing around here during break is a\nWire their political ads for Democrats running on that station\nShort answer is because I mean it's the law I don't think we can reject their money FCC laws uh about uh you know equal equal time for opposing candidates but on the other hand though there's a better question is why would they want to advertise on this station God only knows there's nobody listening to my voice right now\nSort of maybe a few of you I bet it is one percent of our listening audience that's going to vote for those candidates and and voting for those candidates will have nothing to do with hearing those ads on this station if you're thinking of voting for those candidates\nYou're probably only listening to the station because you hate us there is no way there's no way you're tuning into this station there's no way you are tuning into the station because you don't want to\nCause you don't know how you feel about the Democrats for the most part most of your probably already have an opinion and you're turning into the station to get caught up on things and that's okay I Want to take calls from you guys I Want to know how you feel about what we've been discussing and also I Want to talk about blacks coming up at first a Christian or on the computer oh quick if you don't mind let's take a quick trip it's that time of year\nI

highway between the waffle house or the Firestone Tires [noise]\nSo we had a caller was Dan or re on friday I'm so embarrassed that I Can't remember this we had a caller I thought it was re it's re right we have a listener named right he's a young\nLaw student ... and ... in Massachusetts and he was at the White House on friday\nFor the young black conservative summit with Donald Trump and Don junior and a bunch of other people that were there and\nI for one uh actually want to apologize to him because he called and I only talked to him for a second and then I put them on with Sandy and then we went to a break and then he was gone well here's the thing he's actually at school he's working are you studying and I just want to put it out there that if that was you dude\nI salute you I think that's so awesome that he did that and part of the reason why and bringing in this up now if it wasn't for him calling into the show\nI mean we wouldn't have even known about that because the coverage on it was pretty minimal it wasn't until Kanye West a little earlier today attached himself to this news story or a got a got acquainted\nWith with the whole black is the thing and and said that he's going to actually put out clothes on Qantas always website you guys know Kansas Owens is she's a young black conservative she's affiliated with turning point USA I think is the name of the group and um who's the other one in that group I guess it doesn't matter Charlie car cuts that and they're you know they're just young conservatives are\nThey they're not into identity politics one of them happens to be a black lady the other is a white guy and they see eye to eye politically their friends they frequently get attacked when they're in public for their political views you know if they're out getting coffee or whatever it is they're doing so\nI really I really commend her young listener for calling into the show first of all what are you just know that he was there but also just for being there in the first place because of the press coverage on that was minimal at best and it it it really\nOn the radio and then honestly it bothered me all weekend like that I just talked to him for one minute and then we went to a break and then he was gone and I wanted to talk to a more but I didn't make it more clear that I wanted to talk to him so he probably thought I was done talking with them I Am in a few minutes ago\nThe coolest thing happened to his mom called his mom is on the\nPhone right now I don't mean to embarrass him going to are you there I Am here Glenn how proud of them are you right now\nI'm very proud of my son\nWhat what is it you want him to do what are your aspirations for him\nUm whatever he wants to do that he'd be the best at it and then he doesn't let anybody stop him with their mail work just because they don't think the way he thinks or because he's had a lot this week and he's like I've been called every thing by her every move\nOr just like um the reports from Al Sharpton and and what they're saying he's like I'm a part of the group that they're talking about they're talking about me I'm like well don't let the worst they say stop you from what you have an ... and you\nYou know what ... what the truth is you know what the goal is you know what you need to do just because they're over there trying to down talk it doesn't mean anything ... raise you\nGive them something to hate going up\nYou know how refreshing to hear you saying that honestly you almost probably deters or we have had a day\nOf nothing but in in the wake of a terrible tragedy people trying to politicize the corpses laying out on the ground and it it's been hard to wake up and coming to a news station this morning\nAnd deal with all of this isn't so much horrible negativity over a forty eight hour period and there was this one really beautiful thing that happened in Washington DC on friday and your son was a part of it look I\nI've been I've tried to be nothing but objective on the president when Trump is something I like I praise them and when he doesn't I Try to be as critical as I can without being hyperbolic or write sensationalizing\nDo you are there so I got to ask I mean you're listening to the showing your son does you to share similar political beliefs\nWe do because like um when he first started getting into politics of course he was more with the Democratic side because so where are his age group and ... and the first black president and everybody's all happy and excited about that a notice I wasn't quite react in the same as everybody else\nInteresting and but my husband is a Democrat so of course he was happy in most all the family everybody but then as time goes on and we're talking about things that he's riding with me in the car or he's listening to the things I'm listening to like a mat Patrick and Michael berry and all that he start\nThinking differently I guess you have it at a different\nPoint of view and we got to go to the Ted Cruz rally years ago when he um was\nThat stood on the Senate floor and filibustered for as long for that time period yes and\nSo we got to do that without pictures with Ted Cruz and I think that was more or less a turning point from him for him because he was like um like he was elected to do this to try his best to stop the Obama bill and that's where he was doing it\nFor ... and he did it when he said he was going to do and that's why he was like OK has to start looking at what are they saying they're going to do and what do they actually doing\nSome Glenda you being a conservative and your husband being a Democrat is there ever a rift in your house or do you go yeah [laughter] how do you how do you guys do with that does it affect your ah you know your Lloyd sometimes not not necessarily\nLove life you know you got outside the bedrooms outside of the bedroom\n[laughter] I have the outside usually thought of that out here and here we are in here for some people that might be a turnoff like oh I get to sleep with somebody from the other side I much I Know you're sort of listen to this interview so I'm not going to try to make to make that the focus of this because he and\nMy husband go at it all the time and let my son has been question at school or are you black his back blackness has been questioned the same thing goes for my daughter um their blackness this question of like you were born but I cannot choice but to be black wasn't the heck does that mean how you bragged ... can you not see my color\nPeople like if you see me you don't see my God I'm like I Can't help but see a color I'm trying to look past the kind of what is it about\nYou that makes you you you're more than just your caller we all have the color we all bleed red what makes you you\nWow that is so beautiful Glenda I mean it's Halloween time we're all skeletons on the inside you know what I mean every all at the same at one point or another every one of us it's it's absolutely true yeah we're all in the middle I'm ... I think that's so awesome and I so I Wonder what what what a black\nPeople think about when when other black people tell you you can't have this opinion or you can't you can't share that ideology what does the word they use uncle towel\nWords are but I generally don't discuss politics much because I'm like generally the odd person out there for that\nAmount of that conversation if somebody asks me I'll tell them and then they just look at me like I'm Crazy and I lost my mind and they move on I'm like okay well you ... I told you\nSure yeah I feel you\nKnow automatically assume everybody in the room goes along with you so\nSo so what comes next for your son now is he going to get more involved in politics I mean this must have been he he was he said he was already influenced by Ted Cruz filibustering Obamacare and the and I say mhm\nYou think that this is I mean I had him out and meeting with the president is really got to be a life changing experience\nYeah he he is super hype right about now he's ... he this weekend just totally hype them up is already I'm outspoken about his political beliefs as it is he's not like me more reserved I guess because over time is like I don't want to hear people talk about\nHow could you do this you're black now and so he's like oh yeah I Believe that he has no problem than it so I don't know what the whole time but I Know that all of this has been an influence on them like say the Ted Cruz rally\nRight we have been the two of the town hall meetings with um that Patrick and share fryer and he was able to get his hands there and go into different things so I Do see him in politics he said he more or less the U.S I was more like a\nHe's going toward legal now but at first time one time was from a gentle but I Know isn't because he wants more the truth mantle nets his whole thing from this past week and he's like mom deadline I have never heard of like I've I've heard him say about fake news that might I see it for myself this is really fake know who\nWrite it really is so you know it's an interesting thing I mean when I Lived in Chicago the Democrats in Chicago as progressive as they get and then I moved to Houston and one of the first thing I noticed here is um black Democrats in Houston are very conservative by Democrats standards they are [laughter] I I\nI mean they they tend to be have traditional views of marriage they tend to they're not big fans of abortion they don't want to have transgender bathroom right it's not a big cause for them and I don't think it is for most people but\nAre going to ... this has been an awesome radio segment I'm so glad that you called in and I really appreciate you I Know you set off the air you can't make it in this Friday but if you have any friends didn't want to come out\nAh to our town hall we're having here we've got a few seats wafting I'd love to get somebody on a ... and ... calling

even have to bring this up but yesterday in the news cycle all I heard all day long which people blaming what happened at the synagogue just as they blame the pipe bomber on\nDonald Trump couple of things wrong with that narrative let's start off with is\nThe guy the synagogue was adamantly opposed to Donald Trump he thought Donald Trump was disgusting human being what did you call them a a a a ... a plant from the feds because Donald Trump is\nPro Israel Donald Trump also has family members a child and grandchildren who happened to be Jewish doesn't make sense to blame Trump or the Senate

when you show up to a polling place you don't want to accidentally vote for a crony right there's a group here in Houston called the sea club see clubs and interesting group it's a nonprofit group\nUh and and what they do is they specifically find candidates that they could they consider to be pro business pro business candidates\nAnd I'm I'm sure it wouldn't surprise anybody that most of the candidates that they're supporting I'm not exactly leftist will get into the nitty gritty of this but first live on the line right now I I think he's in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Christopher suck rhymes with book he is from the club how you doing Christopher\nI'm doing very well and I am in Houston so beautiful day here\nPresent your time your your group is called the sea club\nI've heard of your group before in fact not coincidentally because Michael berry has used you guys before as a source for some of the people that he endorses but I actually got to listen to reach out to me and say hey why don't you have somebody on from the sea club you consider yourself a pro economy pro business guy and I said well I Do consider myself that\nAnd so I always try to listen to listeners when they tell me we should get on like minded individuals and that's what I'm doing today that's how I found you Christopher his book but I didn't realize until I went to your website that you guys are kind of affiliated with some friends of mine\n[noise] we have a we have a hundred numbers here in Houston area been around since Nineteen sixty four and we have been one of the most trusted sources for voters or for that fifty plus you're a timeframe and we're we're really glad to be able to share the information with the voting population\nMost of your endorsements make perfect sense to me a U.S Senate candidate you guys like Ted Cruz would you like to explain why\nIt's so ... you know Senator Cruz has been you know very very supportive of what we consider to be a pro business agenda also very supportive for the city of Houston a particularly during Hurricane Harvey and all of the other issues that we've dealt with during his during his time\nI mean you know Senator Cruz is is is solid he is someone that we know is going to vote\nFor things that help us get an efficient and effective government\nPretty pretty cut and dry I feel the same way about cruise ah I I don't think there's any way sometimes we you know sometimes we talk about is it better to support the third party candidate when the Republicans a big\nBig government guy Ted Cruz is certainly not a how about this one us Stay in the United states representative district to Dan Crenshaw this guy is new to the scene uh I I absolutely agree with that is what are you guys like about the ...\nSo Dan is as someone we know during the uh the primary and and one thing that I can say about Dan if he is extremely solid he's incredibly bright\nAs of course at great personal story but more than that even he has a great vision of what he believes that a conservative should look like over the next you know ten to Twenty years obviously appeal to voters in a significant way because of his personal story but more importantly he has what I consider to be and\nWhat I think our court considers to be a vision for\nHow we can reach younger people more I'm more minorities across the aisle and ... people over to recognize that conservative values are going to be what we're going to be able to use to drive our economy for not only here locally but also of course of the federal level\nTotally agree I almost feel like they encourage has a great candidate bottom line I I almost feel like if you had come along a few years sooner he might have gotten some big support from the Tea Party movement when that was still going on but Donald Trump supporters which is obviously the current populist movement for the right seem to be embracing him\nA United States representative district seven John Culberson the incumbent you guys are are supporting the guy who's already holding that position I take it\nThat is correct that is going to be one of the most um close\nRaces probably in the county at the at the federal level [noise] ah you know John has been there for a long time he is is been there for Houston when Houston has needed them [noise] um more importantly you know he is someone that we can count on to vote for pro business agenda his opponent Lizzie Fletcher\nIs absolutely not\nA pro business a candidate or she is someone that is clearly going to align yourself with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the left and she has made that very clear as well as embraced money from those folks she is someone that would be anti the pro business agenda that we would want to see put forth\nTotally agree with you know you see so many of these political ads on TV and you wonder like\nCan I trust is is everybody on the left really associated with below sea or George Soros when they say that they are well that seems to be all Lizzie Fletcher is getting her funding for anyone that's scary as she is definitely connected to below sea that's not just rhetoric I'm obviously you guys like Kevin Brady I'm I happen to agree with you on that one\nA ... a representative right he's been great for you know the economy overall again Houston in general but when we look at the tax cuts and the benefit that we've had\nIn the um ... in in capital investment in corporate investment in corporate profitability and if you look at you know the lowest African American unemployment we've seen in history\nThat we've recorded a data and obviously it's true is on the\nYeah I'm Hispanic population we're absolutely one hundred percent you know indebted in many ways to Kevin Brady for his leadership and getting that tax reform bill passed last year\nI noticed you don't have anybody for district nine and it's probably not a coincidence that district nine the person facing there's no Republican challenger to Al Green or how Al Green has raised some very sketchy characters in the past\nThere's even a video of him online hugging Louis Farrakhan hum I've had a hard time with this one myself cause with no Republican challenger\nWho you support well it turns out the Libertarian Party has a guy named Phil Kurtz she's pro life he seems to be pro immigration reform as his policies are certainly not open open border tends to be pro business have you given any consideration to endorsing him\nYou know someone that we talked to and do not get a chance to have much information on him so\nSimply and in in the case of the the club which I think you're a viewer your your listeners would would care about\nIt takes Seventy five percent of our membership to agree in order to endorse a candidate which is a very very high hurdle in this particular case we we're not going to endorse I'm Carson green and so as a result we were not able to get the consensus on the libertarian candidate\nAl Green is just a mess and he's an abomination for for policy in Texas I mean the guy could not be worse\nUm I I encourage you guys to take a closer look at so Kurds she's a conservative happens to be running as a libertarian but only about one one ah let's see here let's go down the list a little bit um here's another one I was curious about some for commissioner of general ... George Bush\nYou know there's a lot of people on the right but don't like this guy particularly his opinions of the Alamo but but I take it you know that's not necessarily something that you guys are taking into consideration when you decide who you're endorsing\nWe we look at we try to look at everything but at the same time what matters to us the most is how they're going to you know look at the business climate and going to drive the business climate that is conducive for\nA for job growth and for people to be able to expand their opportunity set out in the case of these two candidates\nI'm you know the gentleman on the left to someone that we're definitely not aligned with Ryan in any way shape or form\nUm George Bush is someone that a lot of our membership you know are very very close to and while yes he has some some outlier um folks that are upset with him I'm On the right hand side ah when you looked at the overall consensus it was to endorse him which we have done in the past\nAnd clearly we expect when we endorse a candidate whether we endorsement a path\nFor them to live or at the time of their next term and so George Bush knows that he's got two and he's heard from off but he you know obviously we want to see some of these other issues get resolved which I'm sure he will and he'll if he does a good job then obviously will happily embrace him again in the future\nGrading answer I appreciate that I'm a little skeptical of the Bush years I mean I I'm just sick of political dynasties maybe I'm just being biased here that's the only other race in America are in Texas right now where I'm not endorsing the Republican I'm addressing the libertarian and that's my opinion on a second look at the governor now you got Greg Abbott versus somebody\nFrom law enforcement who didn't even get endorsed by the very law enforcement agency the she used to work with would you like to talk a little bit about ...\nSo that race was over before it started um you know we still need everybody to show up and and and and cast their vote you know the governor has done a wonderful job leading our state and he is someone that has a great vision for what the state should continue to look like you\nKnow that is that is just as much of a cut and dry I'm no comparison of someone that is pro business and somebody that would be anti business and and the governor has our support fully\nA you know I really appreciate that and that brings up another question for you Christopher why do you think the Democrats are so excited about ... work and they don't share that excitement for Lupe Valdez does this have entirely to do with how somebody looks on TV I mean it's pretty clear they have the same policy positions\nNow it is shocking to me that people would be supporting a representative a roar going to have absolutely no idea what he stands for you know there is no question in what you said is a hundred percent accurate\nYou ... you know ... is is someone that is charismatic and he's got you well spoken and you know people are looking for someone that they can shine a light on if you will but the vast majority of people if you ask people on the street they have no idea why they want to support\nHim and what he's done for them and it is appalling\nTo me that we have a vote or a a an electorate if you will that is not looking at what this person is going to do for the state or to the state or in that particular case um but also the differences the amount of money that he has raised and been able to garner which is allowed him to get lots and lots of visibility\nLevels of war was the one that\n[noise] [noise] we know you're out there\nHiding in plain sight living a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grain there's a better way a better life and lifestyles unlimited it's time to live the life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income lettuce show you how\nIt's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshops [noise]\n[noise] well come back you know here's some more money and wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one version of bumps in the last\nMinute to do on the radio show with me here today is fabulous couple Bethany then Gregor ... attack\nA Dallas who currently own thirty and communities right now have purchased forty eight six multifamily communities over the last three and a half years three thousand seven hundred twenty nine units and uh they've done thirty five different lead invest thirty three different ... of which twenty five of\nThem were first timers so the question came as we went to break tell us your theory share with is your theory of having such a large percentage of your portfolio\nWith first time investors I think it's an interesting concept [noise]\nWell we did it when we first joined a lot of people are like you need to be heard they had three great you need to go meet them based on all the great deal and nobody really seem to be saying oh well spent yeah nobody knows that that is that in the early ... so\nI think that we only get a better chance of getting on the other thing that we have it at it that often that we don't have\nEvery can in ... on the typically they already come up with it um they already know how to set everything up while you can learn those things oh man it's a you know if you're sitting and watching them\nIf you're with at first and only you can either in the heart of helping them or the thing I really lived a life that you can\nFind out exactly how they're getting the get go with what they look at with Iraq all all that stuff and ... than\n... ... ... ... and that's why we have that I could learn more\nPoint of view I'm going to share with you I think a first time investors are seemed to have a little bit of an edge in my heart to some extent not be honest with you\nOr for deals I bought into this year is a passive we're all super ... leads that I Know personally so um it it's going to sound disingenuous but here's the deal is that I Believe that for you guys a first time investor brings two things to the table but are better than a ... a ...\nA a experience about your number one they're taking a lower percentage of override on the deal\nDue to the white paper the rules and regulations\nThey can't go suck up a large portion of the profits on the friday and middle end the back of the deal like a very highly compensated lead candidate for many years uh he's able to take up up to twenty percent of the deal whereas you know a ... going to take five percent\nSecondly most of these beginner deals are leads are buying deal small enough that they can afford to get into they qualify for enhanced it's not where they want to end up so they just attack\nYou know there is an attack mode to get this deal done number one because it's\nThe jets are going to fail a so they're just all over it you know it's like peanut butter a slice of bread they're stuck\nTo that deal and secondly they want to sell the deal because they want to move all they want to get to a big deal so they want to get to that results that dean as quickly as they care whether they're going to refinance somebody out or ...\nReally irrelevant but it gets you to that point sooner because they're just really more aggressive that people go like you know I already ... and and this was just another word getting into what brought you know\nThe story is it a go back to pumping iron which is about body builders Arnold Schwarzenegger is talking to Lou Ferrigno father or Lou Ferrigno which was the hulk is trying to be our will do in the Olympian\nLoose values are I don't know Louis pretty big pretty hungry you're you're ... you're not hungry sitting in your you know blue is hungry line and are looked at him to go to Joe Louis maybe hungry he says but I always get sad\n[laughter]\nAs though there's something about being the guy at the top it's already done that as you know so they do it so I have you guys realize the benefits from having lower compensations from the first I Believe or not\nOh definitely I Can't begin any like return for both first timers lead on and you know you're exactly right they had a lower percentage and\nAlso you know they were smaller guilt a lot easier to get your money in like\nWhen you know you're only basing it on three hundred thousand that an investor deal rather than I think were it was like eight million dollars [laughter] your money invested in the deal\nAnd actually that grew up you know who saw the the deal so far with those beginners or with those all across the board the ones that you sold to ask in this practice is getting out of ... going to be gone\nFor the first time only two of them well one was the first time that it was actually a second sale and all of the second I only and then the other two were making eight eight at multiple deals\nSo six out of the were predominantly newer investors try to move their portfolio along a which actually especially when we come to the show now guys I Want you just do in your own words sure what the audience as a past skeptic\nHow you think they should overcome their skepticism in why you think they should overcome their skepticism as to this as an alternative investment plan compared to the stuff we've been taught our whole lives\n\nI Would think well I mean when you look at a Geiger sorry oh go go\nOn most of the millionaire when you look at it they own real estate and\nThey're there for it you know we aren't a lot of pieces a mutual fund stocks\nAnd whatever but to me that's not very tangible I mean we have gone in ... every single apartment community that we've been best and there's nothing like looking at it I'm thinking of the things that we've done to improve those residents

exactly like a liberal\nOf Houston us pretty probably pretty mixed over their single ranch for those that live outside the market or those that don't live on the Westside Houston single ranch is a it's\nA really nice town and it's right next to Katie\nI live in Houston but sometimes my wife and I drive out there to go to the torches tacos um you know it's just a nice area to walk around and single ranch is a nice area but it does sound like you've got profiled and it sounds like you've got discriminated against here's the ruling on this Kyle I'm Glad you called about that so for those that don't understand how story let me just give you the nuts and bolts of the\nCoyote got discriminated against at a polling place because he was wearing a T shirt that Ronald Reagan's face on it and it was it and it was a comedy short he wasn't wearing a shirt that said\nVote Republican or you're a dumb you know [laughter] I think I'm allowed to say that word on the air but I stopped myself my producers giving me a dirty look vote Republican or an ass wagon vote vote Republican or Europe\nMore on what the ruling from the Supreme Court last June is that you're allowed to wear a political shirts at a polling place at\nAs long as they're reasonable so what that means is that can't be it can't be a grossly offensive shirt your shirt\nAnd and that even even that right there is a bit subjective right like that begs the question OK well offensive do so you're allowed to wear political clothing to to polling places the Supreme Court struck down a law that barred voters from wearing political apparel at a polling place last June this was a news story\nWe encountered earlier this year it was a seven to two decision a so this would have been post Gorsuch but ... off of the Supreme Court and for those that are wondering and and there are laws\nIn places like Texas and Kansas and Montana and New Jersey and New York and South Carolina that said you cannot we're\nPolitical peril but that's been struck down I don't think what you were was that offensive Kyle I guess that would be the question maybe we should open this up to our listeners do you think that that's an unreasonable thing to wear to a polling place at just to recap Uri worst shirt with Reagan's face on it that said what did it say hippies what\nI smell it it's very funny but it's not really it's just a joke right like it that that seems to suggest\nWhat they're suggesting there is that hippies can't be conservatives or Republicans and that's just not true tell you what I Want to know what our listeners think about this to pick up the phone give us a call seven when three two one two five nine five oh do you think the tile was profiled you think the title was discriminated against were his rights\nWere his rights infringed upon a local polling place I Would argue that they were but I'd love to know where you guys think don't change the channel more show coming up\nLoses pursuit of

Caribbean including a shooting involving police and get pass migrants I'll give you some information on that coming up but first I just want to finish up with this caller Kyle you called me up and you were a big concern you felt that you got discriminated against at a polling place or you wondered if you did essentially you got into trouble\nFor wearing a T shirt that says Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan space on it and it said I smell hippies and they told you you couldn't wear this at the polling place did they eventually let you vote over there and single ranch\nNo they they gave me the option to step in to the restroom and trying to sure didn't sign out but I didn't agree to do that and you know I kept asking for provide me some sort of written rules some sort of\nSome sort of structured writing that says I'm not allowed to be there in that place while wearing that shirt and they can do it and so they offered to me removed if I continued to disrupt the activity there\nAren't hard I think it's pretty clear that if anybody needs to vote to vote in cinco ranch uh this week are coming up on November ... on a on a hop on election day I Need everybody to wear\nA just wear T shirt that you think closely skates close to the line without crossing over into offensive and why they can't turn everybody away my wife hates this Kyle but you know what I Would have done if I were you\nWhat my wife hates when I Do this to people someone will tell me a story and then I'll go you know you should have done but\nHere's what I Would have done a right then and there I

what she got to say you're not you're within compliance with the law you're allowed to be short listed a ... at a polling place right\nThrough the ... uh through a southern state of Mexico the attacks followed shortly after the government warned about Molotov cocktail attacks around the second caravan and yes there are two Caribbean so that makes the reporting on this a bit confusing some people have been having a difficult time differentiating between the two\nIn news reports and I I think the media is having a hard time figuring out which is which this goes back to what I was just saying if you're not really down there doing field reporting then you can't really report on what's happening what Breitbart has done a great job of but see what you will about Breitbart but the Breitbart tax esteem [noise]\nThey have really shined a light on what's happening there far more than CNN or Fox News or even us has been able to do [noise] um this attack took place with Mexico's federal police they were squirting a migrant caravan\nAnd these guys open open shots on a minute here's what's interesting about that one of the gunman's clock jammed up and that was the reason why police were able
