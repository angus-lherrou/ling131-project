our Supreme Court justice and that's OK finally after fighting and fighting for weeks conservatives and Republicans find finally got what they want a moderate swing votes on the Supreme Court her\nUse just vaguely a Republican look I'm\nNot I'm not trying to crap on the celebration after all this is a nightmare for people on the left there to them this is the apocalypse it's it's the beginning of the end all all of the worst things they ever imagined but again I just I just like to remind everybody strikingly similar opinions\nAs the guy he's replacing Justice Kennedy which means for the most part this is more of the same this isn't a big change for America it's really not some people think that we're going to get to\nDecide again on roe versus Wade do not hold your breath I have a hard time believing that is going to happen tomorrow justice Kavanaugh will get to decide\nOn his first a legal dispute he'll get to weigh in on the first ever Supreme Court ruling and it it has something to do with um with guns used during crimes and I don't have all the details on that but you know what we'll talk about it tomorrow in the meantime judge Kavanaugh was sworn in as protesters outside of\nThe Capitol building lost their collective mind\nThey rely can and we were all like yeah\n'cause that's the way it goes folks if you don't like justice Kavanaugh here's\nAn idea maybe build a time

real takeaway here is that Russians new to go to Scott and Hillary didn't [laughter]\nWe're not going to this isn't a show that the ... election now we got we have a new election\nOn their eyes and now the midterms are right around the corner we're we're almost there folks it's coming up real soon and\nI'm thinking about putting a voter guide up for some of you guys but I I couldn't imagine I put anything on the voter guide that most of you don't already know about for the most part you should probably the vote voting Republican in November unless you live in al greens district in our brains district you don't have a choice\nOver there I think the only candidate is the uh the libertarian what's his name fill fill hurt spell Kurt something like that the point is there's a the the only conservative you have to choose from in that race is a is not even a Republican he's a libertarian but anyway so what does this all mean for us while Trump celebrating he says it's tremendous victory\nAnd some of the you may have seen this footage of Lindsey Graham\nBeing chased his car I I use the term chase very loosely here\nIt's it's maybe my favorite Lindsey Graham name it's Lindsey Graham walking out to his car\nAnd he's kind of doing like a self the moment with his camera or is that it's a reporter holding the camera and then behind him UC security holding at bay the protestors the grassroots activists and they are furious but [laughter] but not but not Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham's got this ... and grin on his face is just smiling in Lebanon\nAnd as they stood there and they said we're gonna we're gonna blow you out\nWhen Lindsey Graham knew what you and I know what what most of us knew is that you have to live in South Carolina\nTo vote out Lindsey Graham but you don't have a choice it's not I mean you can't you can't vote on the south Carolina senatorial race if you live in Michigan or Virginia\nOr Florida or California although people in California Boy are they they're so interested in what happens in other people's states aren't they they just\nThey can't shake it they can't they can't stop worrying about your life and your business in trying to poke a little rotted taxes to tell us what to do here in the Lone Star state well that's why I'm grateful that Mike Pence is actually in Texas today he's going up to Dallas to do a little campaign for a buddy Ted Cruz up there and you know\nDon't hurt it's nice to get a little push\nI'm sure that Ted appreciates it in the meantime this is what this really means what Kavanaugh's getting on to the Supreme Court really means for you and you and me\nAnd that guy over there and her and the backing him in the rear no pun intended is that uh apparently what this really means is that now that Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court we all need to start worrying about midterms so that's where everybody's turning their attention now\nAnd ... and and not to be done Spartacus went there as well oh Spartacus Spartacus by Spartacus Cory Booker he went to Iowa over the weekend to give a speech\nTo the Iowa Democrats nothing really that interesting happened there the real news is that he went in the first place\nWhy would Cory Booker be interested in traveling to New Jersey well I think we know why he wants to run for president and and he will Cory Booker will absolutely be one of the uh he will he will actually be one of the ... the candidates for the nomination for the DNC and and\nThat that the influence of Kavanaugh getting on the Supreme Court\nHas made a tremendous effect on the Democrats because now now some of them want senator her own odor to run for president well she never had a prayer saying that's\nBefore she suddenly it was just lucky enough to be on the Senate Judiciary committee in time for one of the most contested judicial nominations in history anyway I'm just getting warmed up we just got on the air this pursuit of happiness radio pursuit of happiness

Catholic\nMom is very Italian mom lived in Italy mom spoke Italian mom speaks Italian she doesn't you know in South or anything I grew up in a household with a very Anglo wash the father Ken Webster I'm Ken Webster junior it's not a coincidence but my dad has the same name as we might be weird if it works\n[laughter] of course I mean that would be stupid but now\nAnd my mother a Donna and got a very Italian spend a lot of time in Italy grew up in Italy my grandpa got my mom\nTo marry my dad my dad was a substitute teacher at a school where my my grandpa was a principal mom my dad was going to business school\nAnd my ... my grandpa convinced my mother and not to marry this guy in Italy\nBut instead to marry my father it didn't happen overnight though she fought kicking and screaming on that one but it did eventually happened eventually my mother fell in love with my dad ah the good old days arranged marriages on anyway so so today is an important day for Catholics today's Columbus Day\nTechnically Columbus stays on the twelfth but today's the day that we honor it said oh my Catholic American homes out they're\nHappier Columbus Day and happy Columbus Day to the rest of you as well despite everything the leftist told you Christopher Columbus really truly is a notable folk hero for minorities in America no it's true he is a hero to minorities in America all explain why in fact he was one of America's first ethnic folk heroes\nHe was used as a symbol for patriotism and pride back with Catholics were fighting against the Ku Klux Klan at the turn of the twentieth century but American Democrats don't seem to remember or care let's talk about that for just a minute shall we\nUnlike Halloween and May Day and International Women's day\nUm and and ride on the streets day Columbus Day is a rather unpopular holiday in twenty eight teams the Democrats don't want it\nThe way they love May Day and International Women's day who doesn't want him tampon appreciation day I mean who doesn't love that you know how the left is like if this is like act ethically unpopular though this is a holiday they really hate Columbus Day in twenty Eighteen\nIs about as unpopular as barbecue sauce on Texas Texas brisket and those of you and I bought the joke but it shows you that live outside of Texas if you don't get that joke\nUm maybe you're listening on line in Chicago right now it's as unpopular as catch up on a Chicago hotdog\nYou don't do it it's what you just don't do it most you probably know the story of Earth Day Earth Day was created by who I rhino horn why is the famous murdered his lover shoved or in a a\nHe shoved or in a a a a box and kept her there for weeks Earth Day was created by the unicorn killer I discussed in person a leftist activist who made a name for himself on a national\nLevel and then shoved his girlfriend's decomposing corps in the trunk so that sort of thing\nWell now the politically incorrect social justice warriors of America One of a limited Columbus Day and replace it with something called indigenous people day it's worth pointing out that one of the founders of this movement was just as morally reprehensible as I rhino horn the first major political leader in America\nTo sign legislation transforming Columbus Day into indigenous people day\nWas former Seattle mayor\nEd Murray now who remembers why he's famous\nIt was one year ago it was a relatively short time ago folks it happened in twenty fourteen um other mayors of smaller cities have passed similar laws in previous years Berkeley Santa Cruz in the nineties Minneapolis a couple of weeks after Seattle but no city as well populated as the home of the space\nNeedle or politician as influential as ed Murray had got on board at the time with the indigenous people's day movement alright\nToday while most Americans honor Christopher Columbus Seattle residents will follow in the footsteps of their former political leader by honoring indigenous persons and spending on the grave of Columbus ironically Columbus was an indigenous person for mentally but for some reason left is just referred or indigenous people as\nPeople with dark skin I guess if you have lightly pigment its skin and can't be indigenous but it's a bunch of malarkey of course you can be of ... and of course they are they absolutely are anyway\nSo ed Murray very likely won't be celebrating with his fellow Seattle residents he's still dealing with the aftermath of his twenty Seventeen political scandal in which it was revealed that he may or may not have raped as many as five underage boys\nDied yeah yeah we all forgot about that yeah one of the guys who helped launch indigenous people day is actually a guy who\nMay or may not have been a child molester he's currently involved in some lawsuits regarding that\nAh but on the subject to the indigenous people day well what the heck is it what is why do we call it that well just so we're\nClear technically everyone is an indigenous person from somewhere\nThe definition of indigenous means originating or occurring naturally in a particular place being a native ... that definition of that word is just make enough\nBut it basically applies to everyone on earth everyone's in a digital person from somewhere so why would you celebrate it did you just people day that's silly well because like the leftist silly\nThe left wants us to hey Christopher Columbus\nTheir opinions of him but unfortunately for them or about his distorted as a as the lessons that we once learned in the twentieth century public schools it is true that some of the things that we learned about Christopher Columbus has kids weren't exactly accurate but the things that they're telling us today aren't exactly accurate either\nToday liberals will tell you Colombo which is his real name Columbus his real name was Colombo that he killed and raped American Indians but that statement is not entirely accurate\nThe truth is he originally trying to convince the queen of England to make peace with the people in the new world\nHe wanted to form a colony for Spain to trade with the people of India whose which is so we thought was here he thought he was in India we all know that part of the story and simple math facts matter it's relevant to point out that the indigenous people he was trying to trade with weren't even technically Native Americans\nIsn't that interesting they they were actually living in the Dominican Republic or Haiti or the Bahamas the very fact that we don't exactly know where he landed says a lot about how much we really know about the alleged crimes that he was later accused of committing\nColumbus actually made for unique trips to the region each trip was totally different from the previous one his first trip was very peaceful\nThen when he returned for the second trip he discovered that the many left behind had been murdered\nAt the time his order to defend the colony and seek revenge for king Ferdinand and queen Isabella was something that that must must not be objected to\nHe didn't have much of a choice on this one Spain was funding his trip and the natives had killed his men and his men were the queen's men Greenspan\nHe made a third trip which included his brothers has passengers All right let's talk about that this is kind of where it gets controversial Christopher his brothers weren't as interested in diplomacy in ... navigational technology is he was they were fighters not explores\nViolence erupted accusations were made about Columbus and he was previously was briefly detained after his third trip back to Spain\nDetained by the queen of England for what he allegedly done overseas it should be noted though since facts matter but he was released and found to be innocent and allowed to return for a fourth trip\nSo the question is did people die while he was in the new world yeah probably it was a very violent time in history so we asked that age old question do we judge people from the past by modern day standards I Would say that we shouldn't\nBut the people who died were not indigenous Native Americans are so many on the left to suggested after all how could Columbus have killed Native Americans if he wasn't even in America\nHe couldn't and he didn't and this is also why we call him a folk hero hero the legend of Christopher Columbus the idea that he discovered America his base partly in truth but it's not totally accurate he discovered on land mass near the United states of America which was a country that wouldn't exist for hundreds more years and he didn't technically discovered the U.S as we know it today\nThat's not to say that his contributions to modern society aren't still relevant\nAnd it's also not an earring to say that there wasn't violence after Christopher Columbus as men interacted with the natives\nHowever the bases in which this fine what's happened is often drastically misunderstood and Mr reported by the American left in the twenty first century and I'm sure you've heard about it today on social media Christopher Columbus wasn't personally the cause of the violence in fact he was originally adamantly opposed to it\nMany often forget the Columbus made more than one voyage to the new world he made for and he wasn't a\nI'm a I'm a\nClassical liberal he wasn't an advocate for democracy that wasn't what he was into he was kind of like Steve Jobs he he was really good at using technology at the time to do things that had never been done before\nItalian Americans and Catholics and Irish wouldn't have had a folk hero\nFor them to get fired up over while they fought against the racist ... Klux Klan I'm going to make a bold statement here if you want Christopher Columbus are raised from the history books you're doing the Ku Klux Klan of the early twentieth century a favor because that's exactly what they want to do\nChristopher Columbus is a man who was once the euro to those targeted by the most racist people in our country who also happen to be Democrats\nNow he's being targeted by antifa vandals and progressive politicians as they attempt to take down a statue all over America ironically it's hard for so called progressive ... to understand the basic question from our past if we erase history\nAre doomed to repeat it\nWhich by the way it's supposed to be the opposite of progress to call themselves progressives the leftist too busy honoring alleged child molesters like Marie you're murderers like Iran or noticed their own short comings I\nDid I say so much for progress man they don't have new ideas that's the reason why all they can do is fight back against Kavanaugh there's nothing progressive about progressive is um it's not a new idea socialism has been around for centuries in fact talking about Christopher Columbus well\nThe earliest American settlers the pilgrims briefly tried to experiment with a with a with a political and economic system not unlike communism socialism in which everyone shares and get all gets along guess how it worked out\nHere that toilet flushing yeah that's the blue wave but in this sense [laughter] it's also the idea of socialism failing the earliest American settlers didn't work for them at all they ended up using capitalism you know why because capitalism works and it's awesome\nSometimes the leftist has silly ideas\nAnd their ideas are often misguided and confused and inspired by things from real life but it may seem to make sense at the time but never actually do when they come out and [laughter] in our practice in this little thing we call reality\nAll right so shifting focused on that note taking that into consideration all their silly ideas I stumbled across the news story earlier and it gave me a silly idea if I was a progressive\nThis is how I Would read a news story like this\nI'd read this news story and I would come up with an idea that is economically sound an ecologically friendly and absolutely misguided and ridiculous money explains\nI'd like you all the travel with me real quick to Louisville, Kentucky where police are searching for to Kentucky jail inmates face scapegoat late Saturday evening\nBy hiding in a trash can yes it's true folks public transit a favor recycling and using mass transit on all the things the progressive love and living in a government institution progressive love these things\nAnd breaking the law that's also something good progressive plop it actually happened about ten o'clock on Saturday Night Justin somewhere and Jeremy Hunter scape from Louisville metro corrections by hiding in the food waste trash cans that were then taken outside of the facility for disposal according to a statement from the jail\n[laughter] so a witness saw the man escaped and he notified of corrections officer but not in time for them to not get away you know you can only imagine what was going on in the jail that day some guy was like hey there's\nSome guys are going to skip I better tell the I better tell the prison guard in about Fifteen minutes [laughter] you know in a way\nI'm sure he wanted the or he wanted to do the right thing by reporting the missing but he also didn't want to help the guards right isn't that isn't that the uh you know the the rules of the road when you're living in jail I guess and anyway\nSo both of these guys stumbling hunt they were working in the jail kitchen so I guess you see how you got access to the garbage a metric corrections said the men were both minimum security inmates arrest warrants have been issued for them\nAs a Sunday Morning neither of them have been found and the last I checked I don't it's it's Monday now I don't think they've been found yet either Jefferson town police arrested stem or on August twenty seven because of charges of motor vehicle ... so he stole a gun and he was a felon in possession of a of a of a hand gun now he stole a car and he had a hand gun\nAnd he also had ... felony drug possession of drug paraphernalia\nSo probably like a pipe or something we'd I don't know anyway so here's my ideal I told you guys just gave me an idea I think like progressive you hear a news story like that and you put yourself okay the prison inmates living in a state correctional institution and they traveled outside of the prison in a garbage can well\nThat sounds like it's affordable low cost ecological you sound it involves mass transit that's all the things progress it was a lot of there's probably an idea and there's some where they just haven't quite put their finger on it yet [noise]\nHey commuters argue sick of sitting in traffic for hours on end while you try to get to work I share and do what other choice do I have thanks to you and me from the Louisville metro corrections Institute now you can get to and from work faster they never\nKnow with the Kentucky rapid dress transit system rapid trashed transit how does that work it's easy public threats receptive goals are located all over our city while many people use them to dispose of trash most people probably don't even realize you can hit your writing them to\nYou sure can't just climbing died in wait until your friendly neighborhood trash man comes by to pick up the garbage trash man excuse me that's\nNot gender includes said now it's hard in us\nWe met trash person for that matter but how long to wait for a trash person get near I it doesn't take long at all just wait a few short hours while sitting at a pile of British garbage and you'll be there in Kentucky rapid transit system is just as affordable as it is eco friendly with well that's\nGreat I just sitting in a pile of garbage thanks government you are welcome this message paid for by the Kentucky rapid dress transit system banks government it's such a beautiful idea\nYes in in the progressive dystopian future we all ride to work inside of a garbage truck because that's the way the government is okay I guess I'm just being ridiculous but hey speaking of ridiculous how many of you solve this photo over the weekend that ... this viral photo that surfaced on line\nThat said do not warm urine is a picture of a microwave at uh Jacksonville gas station and apparently they're located right near to drug testing clinics now some of you are probably wondering why would they want it why would you want to go in there and microwave urine well they need to get the urine to be body temperature\nBefore they could be drug tested so I guess these poor people this family of Indian people that own are Pakistani or whatever they are had so many junkies coming in their microwaving their urine but they had to put up a sign you think you've got problems now\nIt's a strange time strange times we're living in thoughts anyway I'm Ken Webster junior for the last hour Europe and live

Democrat nomination so what are the people in Iowa think of him why we don't really know because Booker speaking of parents to more than a thousand of Iowa was most influential party activists\nReally only tells you what Democrat Party insiders think of it I'm sure they like them they came out to an event to watch him headline\nHe happens to be the party's first big name to make us for a ... the first of the nation caucus state\nAnd some lesser known candidates offended they're already but don't worry about them Cory Booker is probably the first Democrat\nSo far who stands a chance of getting the nomination that appears to be throwing his hat in in the race ... guess who else wants to run Michael Bloomberg yes Michael Bloomberg\nMichael Bloomberg would probably be better off running as a Republican\nI'm sympathetic but Republicans don't like him either his policies seem very right wing by a by Democrats standards he's talking about how\nUm said some very conservative things about immigration and the economy and people's hatred of corporations or I just don't think he gets it Michael Bloomberg is I'm going to get the nomination so don't worry about that but Brett Kavanaugh might and again it's still too too soon to say for sure\nWho's going to be running against Donald Trump but I have a funny feeling you will be seeing Cory Booker\nAt the debates when it comes time which you know we still got another year or two before this is really gonna come to fruition but\nA ... one person you cannot count on being involved Michael ... some people really wanted Michael ... to run for office you know Michael ... well following friday's announcement by Susan a Senator Susan Collins that she would vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nThe less started flipping on one of their most recent heroes Michael I have an eddy yes it's true the left is now blaming Michael I have an eddy forgetting Brett Kavanaugh confirmed\nA well ... yeah the confirmation that as a ... ... this very fiery speech announcing her decision happened on friday and Collins ripped unsupported claims by ... client Julie sweating it\nAh Kavanaugh facilitated a Cosby us game right but that's what they claimed well one little thing was missing from that evidence any evidence at all non existent\nThese allegations against judge Kavanaugh illustrate wind the presumption of innocence is so important that is what Susan Collins said she said she's thinking in particular not to the allegations raised by professor Ford but if the allegation that when he was a teenager he drugs multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape\nBy by by playing the Julie sweating it card\nBasically what ended up happening was Michael having any took credit away from Christine Blasey Ford which is a lot of the reason why we now have cabin on the Supreme Court so blame Avon ... he may be a Republican operative it's possible because no one could pull off this self sabotage\nRand Paul was the first guy to sound the alarm on Mike Pompeo the current secretary of state\nHe was very critical of the sky when Donald Trump nominated Mike Pompeo to be the head of the secretary of state Rand Paul stopped everyone in their tracks when he said hold on that guy is the neo cons CIA war hawk I'm not voting yes ram unless certain criteria is Matt\nAnd Rand Paul was deadly serious at the time well within about forty eight hours Rand Paul's which just tune people called him a sellout people on the left and the right libertarians Democrats conservatives alike they all said Rand Paul sold out what the time Rand Paul knew something that the rest of us didn't oh\nMike ... who was then the head of the CIA had been meeting having some some undisclosed meetings with North Korean leadership about denuclearizing the ... the country\nAnd what came next was the plans for that Singapore summit we all know what happened next now this stuff doesn't happen overnight it's been going on for months we've been trying to get them to denuclearize for months and for months they've been saying that they play along but North Korea just keeps dragging their feet\nWhat Rand Paul was right about my mom pale\nPale made an announcement after a Sunday meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong tune that they were going to start\nWell they're going to continue the average to denuclearize but that we're going to get somebody on the peninsula to actually investigate and look at what's going on there who is not from China or [laughter] or another communist country\n... barely this meeting was productive they even discussed another summit between Kim Jong un and President Trump hopefully that happen soon\n\n... identified ... ... ... as one of the testing sites mentioned in their conversations\nAnd the U.S top diplomat Mike Pompeo retweeted Trump's tweet touting a good meeting and Pyongyang\nTrump had a thing or two to say about this um and and and he's praising my palm pale might pay a ... as we continue to make progress on agreements made it to Singapore summit\nYou know we all remember what happened in June right when Trump met with Kim Kim in Singapore none of this happening fast enough for Trump's critics\nIt's a slow process diplomacy takes a long time you're asking one of the one of the most violent and authoritarian regimes in the world to change their pace to change really their their entire foreign policy strategy up until now has been threatened the west with nuclear\nWarheads unless we get our way and now for for the first time in our lifetime I mean in my lifetime I'm thirty six years old I'm In my late thirties I never seen anything like this before we've never had this kind of progress in North Korea\n\nThey had uh what was the Korean was it the Korean Veterans day to that happened recently you know that war never ended it still happening to this day\nWe're still at odds with North Korea the the demilitarized zone the DMZ it's as dangerous as it ever was\nBut\nMaybe that'll change maybe during our lifetime we will actually see change will they still call Donald Trump a fascist if he succeeds in these efforts\n\nIt's still not going as fast as we want the tone of the meeting was cordial but Pompeo was hit by a North Korean officials a few months ago as having a gangster like demand for denuclearization North Korea has been very critical of my palm pale and and Trump called off a meeting with palm pay on August due to a lag in the negotiations\n\nThe Washington Post reported that palm pale met with Kim for about two hours and had lunch Kim told palm pale they sat down and he said it's a very nice day of the promises a good future for both countries I'm optimistic folks and you should be too I mean\nAnyone that criticizes Trump should just take a break and hope that this works what's not to like in other diplomacy related news millennia Trump\nAh was in Africa last weekend and she was looking very sharp as she often issues of should we knew it was basically a super model\n[laughter] and she went to Egypt to visit the great strengths of Gaza and\nShe told the press there may be focused on what she's doing an ad on what she wears so I'm guilty of it myself but it's hard not to react to the fact that the first lady looks like a super model she looks like something out of vogue magazine\nI mean she kind of had on this really interesting have you know is maybe like a movie um Casablanca I remember the ... she was kind of dress like that\nThere's this photo of her with the with the swings in the background\n\nJust for just very photogenic purely as I Am stating the obvious here on the radio but I'm sure the oppressor and the the media is just obsessed with her wardrobe and they're also obsessed with Brett Kavanaugh says she travels all the way to Egypt so people could basically ask her about that\n[laughter] you gotta you can see why she's a little frustrated millennia spoke to reporters in Egypt at the end of a foreign country trip to Africa it included a where did they go Kenya wish in Nigeria to\nReporters just peppered or with question the first the questions in the first lady said she thinks Supreme Court justice now\nNominee Brett Kavanaugh he's now he's no longer a nominee that she said he's very qualified she also says she's glad Dr Ford was hurt people wanted her to get more polarizing statements than that but she doesn't cause she's a class act she's classier than her husband is she is a classy lady\nThey asked her if she believed forward\nAnd she said she said I Will move on that I think we need help all I mean we need to help all the victims I Am against any kind of abuse or violence but she wouldn't say so much is just to go I bred\nDid it they asked her if she'd ever asked the president to put down his phone um she said with a smile yes I think they're talking about tweets\nAnd on some other Trump topics millennia said she wishes people would focus on what she's doing and not what she's wearing\nWell it's hard not to focus on that\nYou know she is a super model whose dress by some of the greatest fashion designers in the world I Know she's not a super model but she was just a regular fashion model but then when she became the first lady I Would argue that her model status went from being significantly famous to one of the most famous malls in the world\n\nDo you remember when she went to Mexico they were furious about that she was at the border of Texas Mexico and she was wearing a slogan on her shirt that said I really don't care do you and she said later on it was just a shirt don't worry about it\nAnyway this week some eyebrows were raised when she wore a a pet to helmet hits a symbol of British colonial rule across Africa\nDuring a brief safari in Kenya I think people are just overreacting stuff everything that money a Trump does isn't a statement sometimes she's just wearing clothes and sometimes there's no news stories so people will try to make a mountain out of a molehill poor in this case a a great spank side of a molehill you get the idea\n[laughter] [laughter]\nGotta lifestyles unlimited

in they're investing journey and and just encouraging them along the\nWay I'm so that's really what I see is my main job\nYou know Mark I'm as I mentioned the last segment as a mathematician math teacher which you would think would be a very technical sided thinker a you seemed made most of your ... based on the more emotional\nAnd people oriented side of the decision curve my question you was when you first came to lifestyles physically getting to touch the people were you surprised how open they were\n[noise] oh definitely I mean you know has a [noise]\nWe talking about businesses a lot of businesses are very competitive and they don't want to share with each other you know what their numbers are and you know that's that's what the\nIf a case study um investors upfront sharing their actual experiences with the rest of the members I'm getting to see their\nTheir numbers you know what they invested in to do a deal what kind of things they did to improve a property what their returns are\nUm and so you know the transparency and and even just talking to other members and having them share you know how many deals are you in and you know which deals are good which deals have worked out so well I'm you know everything is very transparent and open and honest and and it's just a great environment\nTo be a part of what\nIs a truly your wife think about\nThis\nWell you know it's interesting she I wanted her to count as I mentioned before back\nTo the two days seminar in Palm Springs and so she came with me and I'm you know she met um some of the people that I've mentioned before and she got to hear Bryan deferred to the the two days seminar and she understands now you know how this whole process works\nFor the most part you know she doesn't really go to all the events that I go to um she went up ... ... pm comes in and we're discussing you know whether we should get into a new deal\nI make sure that I Walk her up and and I'll explain to her all the different parts of this deal and why I think it might be good or not and then well actually sitting and pray about it and laugh you know got to give us some guidance on our investing and you know that's sort of her involvement in it I keep her I'm surprised about what we're doing and and\nMake sure that she's a part of all the decisions [noise] um but she's not his hands on as I Am I I just really love and enjoy the\nTo get out with like minded investors and discuss things and talk with them and just be a part of all the events\n... contrary to that thought you work in a pension based environment what are the\nPeople around you know of what you're doing it or think about what you're doing if you go\n[noise] that's interesting because I've I've tried to share a few times with people and um you know some of the people that I teach with um are very interested in the best thing and um\nYou know there are open to listening to some of the ideas that you know I've shared with them I think other times I'll talk to people and they'll look at me for like a deer in headlights they don't really you know to think about putting down a large\nSum of money on an apartment complex can be sort of beyond you know what they normally think about doing [noise] um so\n... there's mixed reactions I mean some people really started to talk to him and I realized very quickly that it's it's not going to be fruitful and and I just sort of don't go too far with that and other people all share a lot of details with them because they're very interested in an open to learning\nAbout the family\n... family and your ... of the rest of the valley brothers just\nYeah my father in law um is actually came with us to Palm Springs and he is a big number as well and he's invested in twelve or Thirteen deals now himself although he's gotten very involved and um\nMy father who lives in Florida oh I've shared some of this with him he's more invested in the stock market and not so much in real estate and so you know we've we've talked about that and ah you know family is very supportive on what we're doing\nI think that um\nYou know it it's out of the realm of comfort sometimes for people my sister who lives in Cincinnati, Ohio is also a pig member joined after we went and she's in one deal\nI'm with us so we're both in a deal with Brian button in Atlanta and so I'm so\nPeople are very open and my family and very you know interested in what we're doing\nWell that's great really as you know say something Marco through this whole interview\nI've not heard anything any type of skepticism in any way so you're you're definitely a going towards kind of person I just keep looking ahead moving forward guys\nThat's completely different than me which I'm a skeptic I'm moving away from pain away from trouble away for problems so it's interesting to see the dichotomy of personalities are but you've done well in just continue to do well seven deals in seven months is excellent I

the right now but like I said I don't have anything in front of me lunch but yeah I think she must have said something and he said he didn't like him so he just order or be fired because why would anybody give up a governor position\nJust to be with them after nine months later like it just doesn't make any sense to me\nYeah I Do kind of now that you bring it up I I Do kinda remember her um I

anyway we've been talking about Nikki Haley and why she may or may not have stepped down and my last caller raised a great point um there was a disagreement between Trump\nAnd Nikki Haley in the past it was shortly after the summit in Helsinki in which Trump said he wanted to try to be friends with ...\nWhen this happened HR McMaster Donald Trump's former White House national security advisor reportedly told colleagues during his tenure as the president thinks he can be friends with ... I don't know why or why he would want to be well making here we kind of tend to agree with that statement\nA Nikki Haley the while now soon to be former U.S ambassador to the United nations didn't see the president's comments\nOr she simply didn't care because at the time Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations said Russia is never going to be our friend and she did at the time downplay concerns over Trump's meeting and press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin she said we don't trust Russia we don't trust ... put and we never will\nThey're never going to be our friend that's just a fact\nNikki Haley might have a valid point here ... ... is he's a dictator I mean there's there's no other way to put a what a vitamin they're putting does in his country with his own citizens is pretty on wholesome there is a pretty violent disgusting things that happen that regardless of what you think of America possibly making friends with him now I'm\nI'm a big fan of uh of diplomacy I'm a big fan of making friends with your enemy to quote Abraham Lincoln and might not bank washing my enemies when I make friends with him of course that being said we may never be able to make friends with ...\nAt the same time we'll probably never be able to make friends with communist dictator Kim Jong moon but that doesn't mean we don't want to try to denuclearize or possibly prevent a third world war\nI owe that being said it is possible\nThat Nikki Haley is just sick I have in the job I see your calls coming in a feeling Katie why don't you hang on I'll be with your shortly if anybody wants to get in on this why do you think Nikki Haley is stepping down seven one three two one two five nine five zero John and the Galleria that's where I'm at right now same area do you uh do you enjoy the traffic in this part of the city John\nOh we're on the war is the one that I'm doing their work it out or do you know\nOh you're at the TV news station\nOn why pastor ...\nYeah yeah when you when you see those TV guys walking around with their noses up in the air like they're fired stone state and don't you just don't you just want to have you done with all your guts\nMan when I was like the\nWhat about what about whether girls or John nothing wrong with that right\nMan it's pretty good", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "city": "Houston", "day": "09"}
