out of it what's the point there's no really great answer to that um but\nIt it's it's hard to say for sure if this is just a coincidence but similarly at least two packages containing rice and were sent to the Pentagon today the fact that all this happened at the same time is very bizarre I and that's an understatement if the two incidents are connected\nUm it wouldn't surprise anyone with half a brain although now you begin to wonder because apparently the Pentagon says that was real rice and sent to their office today so what did these people send to Ted Cruz's campaign office\nPossibly pay baby powder we don't know but we do know that they were hoping to get a reaction and boy did they get they were hoping that maybe we would stick our tails in between our legs and bow down to what they're trying to do\nWe're not going to do that if the suspicions about this incident or what they appear to be this is just one more example of antifa inspired extremists targeting people called a slightly different political ideology than they'd prefer to have\nSo there's your update on all of this ah we posted this news story a couple of hours ago and in in a short amount of time it it spread like wildfire people are very concerned about this and rightfully so we are Houston, Texas this is Ted Cruz's hometown\nTed Cruz is said and done some things I don't agree with but for the most part I think he gets it right\nSometimes when he's preaching on the soap box about his political perspective and trying to convince others to vote for him to help pander to a group of people I Would call it the Christian conservatives\nAnd I got nothing against those people but that's not what I Am I'm a liberty advocate I'm a libertarian Republican if I'm a Republican at all which I'm not I'm a I'm a liberty minded independent\nSo when I look at Ted Cruz's voting record I see that he votes the way I Want him to vote regardless of what he says when he's campaigning for whatever office and now today that guy who votes the way I Want them to vote people they're trying to scare his volunteer workers\nInto quitting the campaign I mean at least that's what it seems like more on this after this I Am

talking about this thing with Ted Cruz\nAnd we're asking the question okay so somebody takes white powdery substance and they mail it to Ted Cruz's office right and they call the hazmat crew in and they bring in a fire department and they rush people off to the hospital because they ask themselves what would be the motivation there well I don't know about the rest of you but\nWhite powdery substance is don't just mysteriously appear in empty on ... that's not the kind of thing that happens typically\nPeople mail us stuff here at the radio station sometimes mostly it's mostly letters from people in prison you know 'cause they can email us somebody you think of getting but I'm definitely not no we do get mail for people in prison we got to letters today and they were charming it's amazing the great penmanship but some of the people in our\nIn our prison system but anyway um what was I saying oh yeah so we get these letters and there's no white powdery substance is in our in our mail and when I go check my mail outside my house there's nothing there so what's the point what's the point of doing this well they want to\nScare somebody that works downtown and Ted Cruz's office I'm just getting everybody up to speed here now the latest on this and boy this is really weird that this happened at the same day authorities at the Pentagon found it we used to I'm not talking about one but I'm Talking about two packages suspected of containing rice and\nUm with this news coming just right after a scare Ted Cruz's office in Houston involving a white powdery substance is turned out not to be hazardous ...\nPentagon spokesperson um who has been apparently been briefed by us defense secretary James Mattis mad dog Mattis with if you have to bart did you know you have to park when you say his name yeah that's the rule I don't want to that's another FCC law I don't want to get us find like I play by the rules\nWhere was I owe us defense secretary James Mattis I Am an ... stop officer admiral John Richardson I'm back to the lead it's actually the packages were address to\nA believed to be containing rights and that it's possible that this was another prank oh hilarious these huge comedy\nHa ha we made you not want to do your job today gotcha gotcha well how do you think that makes us look bad people on our side or people on their side\nPeople on grass roots activist on\nEarlier this week after you know they're in the past week there when Ted Cruz and his wife\nWere chased out of a restaurant were bragging about that on social media like hey nobody does this debate or Rourke\nYeah there's a reason nobody does that debate or work because the people on our side behave themselves and we generally try to leave each other in public and\nWhen we when we're off work and him and that by the way is the gist of our ideology leave me alone\nReally they're they're really should just be too laws\nDon't murder or hurt people and don't steal their stuff I respect their property those are really the only two laws that matter to me what about the rest of you I mean when you break it down at the end of the day\nI I only care about two things don't murder me don't write my wife don't break into my house and it's three things but you get the idea right like that's that's that should be the main law and America the second law in America and the third thing\nFor them it's it's hey don't use the wrong gender pronouns or you'll get fined a hundred thousand dollars in New York City you think that's an exaggeration that's something the progressive actually wanted there's a new ridiculous law in California this this blows my mind like Abraham Lincoln style these people seem to think\nUh in California but the law that we need\nIs a law that says no corporation can have an all male board\nYou know what I'm saying right now you're cheap officers you've got your\nYour see a cheap operational officer chief financial officer so they're law is All right no women are no women equals illegal and you get fined okay but so so imagine what that means let's say there's three guys and they just graduated from I don't know UCLA Stanford some west coast university\nAnd the two of them said hey you know what would be great uh\nI have a great idea for a smartphone app while we don't have any money so we can't pay anybody that's okay you're an accounting major I'm a business major in our in our third friend here he's a computer software major why don't why don't the three of us just start the business ourself law works for free maybe it will work part time at night delivering pizzas and will be I\nI Know a little bit about what we could apply and be an El Al see like a limited liability corporation if you did that in California you broke\nThe law that's unbelievable it's absolutely baffling as I mentioned\nThat a few minutes ago that there should be other laws that there should only be three lost some of you came up with some great laws in the comments section where am I right now in Facebook Live I should explain that to people listening in the car right now are on terrestrial radio and I have to I have to address these I'm Sandy has a great suggestion here she says fourth law don't hurt my kids are my dog\nAbsolutely but I I kinda think that all falls into the first law don't hurt or murder anybody so yeah dogs and horses for sure\nAnd dogs and horses that kind of falls into the second law to respect people's property right so but absolutely all great stuff\nUm let's see fit for lead me the hell alone yeah that's the whole ideology that's what it really means to be a liberty minded conservative or a conservative libertarian or whatever the heck you are we're getting calls and I want to take 'em so I'll give us a ring Seventy one three two one two five nine five zero to ... the first call\nHey Daniel are you calling from Pennsylvania which part\nOf a bird is one of the car between a\nBite out the panhandle in\nWest Virginia\nSure yeah yeah yeah that's where I'm at\nJust just wish ... how far are you from Scranton that's how I figure everything out in Pennsylvania\nOh about six hours in in ...

Italian Amish to me I'm On the show perhaps they are a bad kid hey what'd you call about\nThe the the ... ... in a in a Pentagon\nMean this is just a bunch of ...\nYeah I mean why\nGet me it's like a friend named getting shot\n[noise] interesting yeah interesting analogy right and so for those that don't get the reference he's talking about how World War one started France or some people think Franz Ferdinand is just an alternative rock band but it turned out they named a a European political leader after after the band\n... did you not know it happened to me I was I was messing with my producer Chris as an old enough to even know that Franz Ferdinand is an alternative route [laughter] [laughter]\nThat same city same town September Six twenty Eighteen black Trump's than booted from a

that\nSeptember tenth of this year Broadway star Carol cook said that uh I was speaking about Trump She said where's John Wilkes booth when you need them now and Carol cooks defense\nShe is really really really really old it's my understanding that George W. Bush and no disrespect to him in the later years of his wife has made some very crass jokes in public places in front of ladies\nAnd this has shocked some political news reporters OK guys but he's in his nineties he's really really really old\nI think if you're really old you get a pass for saying something kind of silly stupid and that's how I that's how I feel about Carol ... situation still not ... Eugene yes you're on television talking to a reporter you're going to joke about murdering the president not a bright move anyway September tenth the same day Hispanic immigrants says she was spit\nOn in Santa Monica for wearing a Trump pat a Hispanic immigrants spit on for wearing a Trump pat 'em that was September time wasn't even that long ago September eleventh Trump Peter attacks California GOP house candidate with a switch played you remember that same day that happened they threatened and raped um\nAh they threatened to raping strangle a writer for writing an anti abortion between it was DC McAllister we've I think we've spoken or on the radio before uh September eleventh D.C police investigated a threat to commit mass shooting in America event\nAt the Trump International hotel that Cassandra Fairbanks kind of a an acquaintance of mine a very cool girl who used to be a very supporter in switched sides and came over to the Trump team when she realized that the Democrats were completely corrupt and she couldn't trust them and then of course today\nNow less than two weeks later just a short time later we find out that ah that boxes of a mysterious white substance were mailed to the Pentagon twice both times they were addressed to a two prominent Republicans a James mad dog Mattis\nAnd then who's the other one admiral John Richardson of the navy and then of course today a mysterious white substance sent to the cruise office thank God it was non toxic but we all know what the point of doing that when they're just trying to harass people\nI Love that you guys are grown and this is an open forum seven when three two one two five nine five zero seven when three two one two five nine five zero if you want to call pursuit of happiness radio with meat producer Kenny ad from sugar land what's up dude\nI figure slightly when this started it started when I was running remember you had American citizen I'm just being beat up by\nForeign nationals yeah the mayor's is cheap and I told my wife and I said this is not going to show their serious shit and I still think that I kinda feel it\nAnd then we had the congressman shot you know checked it how many Congress may you know I don't think we're going to get their their little\nLittle shoot they think they are yeah I I don't know you have American citizen oh\n\nHow'd you there and I was talking to someone mentioned bring it back to trap it excellent\nNot necessarily to war zones around the world so that they can actually see what we what other people want\nYou know it's interesting you said I Know I have some mixed feelings about bringing back the draft but I certainly understand your point in saying that earlier today there was an op ed from some leftist news rag that went viral and they said that social justice warriors should get the same rights benefits an ACL mission is better and they said social justice warriors\nShould be treated like veterans and now there's this public debate on social media\nBasically among like reasonable people and complete moron which is always what the arguments between over whether or not ... double use are as ... should be honored like a military veterans I could settle that argument right now\nI mean I Know this is an easy one to social justice warriors have to go to boot camp for three months before they're sent off to some third world country where they risk life and limb fighting to to preserve liberty and some strange corner of the earth's where nobody would ever want to go on vacation no they don't well then they're not veterans they'd give me a good\nDon't forget also if they're captured their you know you're an American automatic part\nYeah social justice warriors don't have anything like that to deal with when they go out okay we're social justice warriors what are we going to do today well we found out\nI don't know Susan Collins or some Republicans ... let's say a a tadpole for example we're in Houston is eating dinner with his wife ... bread on on them on Montrose and and so social justice lawyers will realize that\nAnd they'll get all dressed up like I don't know soldiers covered in blood or you know a abortions or whatever it is they're protesting for that day and they'll go down there and they'll just scream at until they have to leave the building and then what happens what's the consequence of that well you might get arrested you might get hair it's going to look great on your on your Instagram feed all ban\nAll you're left his buddies are going to take that looks cool when your photograph getting arrested at a political rally that's going to be super NATO keen uh and then what happens a few hours later your mom and dad bail you out not quite the same thing as getting captured by the Taliban or the al ... I mean it's a little different\nUm but I get what you're saying I I certainly agree with you and yeah that's all true\nThey been harassing us on our side since well before the election my buddy Austin and I\nHave I ever told you the story um I I Know some of our listeners have heard this before and I don't know if you know the story but my friend Austin my friend Dave is a little brother and he lost and I I didn't really know Austin\nBut I knew Dave Dave's this guy who lives in Chicago he owns a business as family runs the business they don't live in Chicago they live in the suburbs and they have a little brother who's mentally challenged and here's some serious mental health issues\nHe happens to be a white kid he was Seventeen years old at the time and it was right after it was it was right before the inauguration so it was right after New Years right before Trump was inaugurated\nAnd he was walking down the street in in Chicago and he was going to meet some some people that he knew from school some people that he thought to be as friends\nAnd one of them tricked him into getting into a car where they kidnapped him for three days and tortured him and they didn't hire they did it live on Facebook it was called the Facebook Live kidnapping some people called the black lives matter kidnapping\nThey torture them for three days um they live streamed it for about forty minutes while people watched it on the Internet and you know these these people that did this to him you know we could say that their kids but they were adults are two of them are going to prison now for six years\nOne of them is going to prison for three years and the other one got a slap on the wrist and part of the reason why that one got a slap on the wrist is because the judge said\nJust didn't feel comfortable with the optics\nOf sending away more black people to prison he didn't think it was going to help them out and you know that that that really upset me upset a lot of people and they said that they were doing it because they hated Trump and they hated white people but this kid wasn't political he was mentally challenged never been to a Trump rally anyway I I've been a bit long in the to the er and I'm almost running out of time had and Daniel and everyone else on hold I really appreciate\nYou guys just call a cause I'm kind of lift your junior this has been pursuit of happiness\nRadio check out my Facebook page Ken Webster junior producer Kenny ... pretty sure can on Twitter came here see radio dot com you can find me on YouTube and Youtube videos a day to radio shows a day and plenty articles thanks so much for listening everyone have a great day [noise]\n\n\nMean\n\nYour when\nIf you inherited a coin collection or you build up a coin collection over the years and you might not be ready to sell it but you at least want to know what it's worth\nWell how do you take it to somebody to tell you what it's worth if there's somebody who buys coins because they're going to tell you it's worth a whole lot less right that's the idea so then they can buy it at a deep discount us going has a great reputation personal friends of mine and there'll be honest with you and if you go well I don't want\nSo at that spot you don't walk out but you can trust them seven won three four six four sixty eight\nSixty eight hello I'm Nancy from that I'm speaking to you today from my home in California you announced it indoors they don't work for\nThe part of my car but yeah that's what I Do I Swear in front of the children and ride skateboard quite you've got to keep our Greece all over the floors well that's not all skateboard Greece set limits perspiration because I'm very sweaty well I guess I'd better call steam cleaning or you could go on line loop steam dot com set a date out\n[noise] [noise] It's Wednesday October third what's new today on the free I her radio as high\nOver the hump with all the best ... station in what happens like the rock top fifty play last doctor's dog and the radio original vision my only experience [noise]\n\nFrom the gallery furniture made America studio\nEyes capital probe could end today jak Callahan Fox News that according to a source who tells Fox News the bureau could wrap up its word by the close of business that's due to judge Kavanaugh's accuser\nDr forwards attorneys are complaining and they still haven't been contacted by the bureau thing in a letter to the FBI it is inconceivable that the FBI could conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford delegations without interviewing her judge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in our letters to hew\n[laughter] uh I mean this will not be one of the shows right price them there's a there's this will be the ladder and occupiers when I'm trying to say later on in the show or a friend of mine's calling in someone you love him many of you hate him but just listen to what he has to say the name is Adam ...

could get a short cut right to my blog and podcast by going to kind of left her junior dot com\nAnd this article was written by Sandra Peterson with a little bit of help from yours truly but mostly written by Sandra and she raises some great points here\nThe main thing we want you to take away from this segment and this article that I'm Talking about right now as best I don't we don't believe that Seventeen year old soon to be a judge Brett Kavanaugh assaulted a Fifteen year old Christine bossy at a party in the summer Nineteen eighty two\nYou've heard what she had to say I heard what she had to say and to me the facts do not support her story so many of us\nLook she was poised in the ... in the witness chair at the Senate hearing she showed some emotion she giggled debate over

high was as I watched her sympathetic to her tail\nBut in the clear light of day\nI simply don't believe her\nShe had so many holes in her story that you could probably build a fifty four hole golf course with all those holes or you know a piece of Swiss cheese whatever analogy you prefer and she and she changed things in her story all out when she first told her tail she said she was

happiness radio\nThey're getting up with us make sure staying awake turning on your radio and learning things to in your mind with education that's what I provide here\nOn pursuit of happiness radio well that's sort of when I provide facts and opinions facts and opinions I tried to give you two facts for every opinion I Try to let you know that my opinions are just crazy things that I say I don't just open up my mind my mouth and tell you that the United states adding another trillion dollars to uh to our national debt has an issue without explaining why\nAnd I don't share these opinions with you without telling you that and I'm not alone in this they're like minded individuals out there who are also concerned about their stuff you know mid mid last month\nSeptember September Eighteenth the Senate passed a very broad spending bill\nHe was aimed at avoiding another government shutdown as shutting down the government would be a bad thing\nI Love when the government could shut down this is this is what was really going on while we were all talking about cabinet and I did it I'm guilty of this to the Supreme Court matters sure it does abortion rights matter is if that's all the Kavanaugh's opinions were based on but you know if you listen to the left anyway I digress\nThis this thing with our budget and the spending bill is ludicrous should absolutely drive you people nuts Trump promised us he wasn't going to do this again when he when he signed the last bad bill\nAnd with all this controversy over cabinet and nobody even noticed it mean maybe it was the perfect time to pass a terrible\nBill I Know when I Know I'm not alone on this on the line right now by the Arizona libertarian political activist and anti politician Adam ... welcome to the show sir\nHey thanks so much can you know about the Republicans on his cabinet thing it all plays right into the general strategy of the super class the elites of keeping us divide and conquer and there's all this under or stuff which I think you and I've covered but now we see the intersection with the fiscal other thing\nThat's really what it's like even that term right there I'm using they're framing as if they can be like saying you know the mafia really needs to work on its fiscal responsibility to stop stealing from people same thing with government right\nThan while the Republicans the last couple of weeks have been saying look at what's going on with with the Democrats they're trying to distract you ... oh my God he will not feel as if they want it clean motivated baseless distraction now look at this distraction look at it look at look at it\nAnd don't mind what we're doing over here we don't let that says it's like oh I Can't really on the American people don't feel that and I think there are enough of us\nWho are kind of ... lead in to ... to marshal rational ignorance where it's not quite rational like we really do need to take\nA little bit of time and I'm I'm not like a the the this we're not going to get freedom 'cause you've written other economics textbooks you know I'm not here to say like what are the numbers that taking calls but the reason the system is so complicated\nIt is it so that you don't get it so that you're pushed away you know I don't think most of the people running in the system right now who really understand how it works either like you mentioned the number and I was like one trillion dollar deficit\nI don't really know what that means I'll be honest I I can like I could look up a trillion that you don't have much money I handle you know the average American makes blah blah blah\nBut really you know it was our deliberately mind boggling we large and out of touch for the average American they may want them to be that way but as we also saw what this means is that the government has borrowed eight or eight thousand dollars per working American government is saying I was thinking about what the government's\nBasis for paying back creditors Brian Steele\nOr money from you as a taxpayer stuff that\nThey have no basis they left they have no basis dealing with the deficit and dealing with that are all\nThere are you the taxpayer the collateral on this\nYou're right they're they're really only has been one president during our lifetime maybe two who cared about this and interestingly enough one of them was well no no no there was Clinton weren't good\nEnough actors to convince you that long well Ken\nKen I'm In that you would even\nSay I'd sure does Trump went after Trump was not a fiscal conservative but this is true but I'm going to say something on his air Adam Adam's them care they\nDon't care none of them here well you know we don't know that but I think that we I think that to some extent I'm I'm going to issue a rare complement to Bill Clinton right now\nRonald Reagan and Bill Clinton balanced the budget when they were presidents and part of the reason why Bill Clinton did it is because he had to your right he probably didn't care he had Republicans in the Senate and in the house at the time and he had to appease them um but so that was Bill Clinton Fein Ronald Reagan actually cared about inflation well I mean he don't we're playing\nYou know can can\nTell me why I'm wrong you're praising Reagan cared about inflation this is one of the only things he did well\nWe're praising lost family members are being good at bookkeeping\nI [laughter] I think that what a what Reagan did with the Iran Contra that that little scandal I I didn't I wasn't a big fan of that although at the time nobody was really aware of how horrible it was but that being said I Do think that from a fiscal perspective\nReagan and Bill Clinton and I'm only comparing them to the other presidents during our lifetime were better than each W W Obama and Trump Trump's\n... you have to put yourself in there because they care about anything other than preserving their power and the reputation and so it's not that\nWell reading got into office in it because he cared about the devastating to know if we get them out\nBut of course but Adam if a politician was well let me ask you here's a question for you about um I'm supposed to be interviewed you know you know I had him I'm supposed to be interviewed and you're right I'm gonna ask you a question Adam I'm going to ask you a question right now you can answer the question or not answer the question if a politician\nAdvocates for a policy and and you think that he's insincere but it's a policy that you like does that matter to you\n[noise] [noise] yes because if a mafia member comes and says you know ... that my you know while I'm waiting tables and like I say well I like the mafia now\nBut that's not what we're saying nobody has says you have to like Bill Clinton or you like Reagan I'm just saying that they were better for the I like to write that he didn't take the money well there you go you and I are in agreement I think this is an argument of semantics but I agree with you that this is an issue and I agree with you that this debt is an issue people seem to misunderstand\nWhat no Ken so like what what\nAre what are we what are we just agreeing on this Syria politicians no argument here Reagan and Bill Clinton or not to Syria right there on politicians do\nAdvocate and you come in using that language and that language I mean wars batter and and I don't mean I'm not really the a lot the glamour Nazi but I Am kind of a philosophical ... not the system\nI I I don't I don't know what the point that you're making I just don't think that indicates what I'm saying and and also say that this is where is this worth over focusing on over the whole segment now we spent three minutes on this [laughter] it is I think\nIt really is important in the training because I I Want your audience if they can get anything from listening to me as opposed to the\nEars dumb whatever they can they can get someone from listening to me just in our in our little bond together\nThat um you get an sold me but you cannot insult the listeners I I Will not let your oh\nNo no I was I was trying to say dumb as in your area than you\nAre on John meant you that is a sweater but only for listening closely to U. Penn as\nOpposed to you know what I Would like to remind our listeners this is a guy I promote on my show every week to miss this hour events me an argument over grammar hurrying guard that was an argument\nOver framing and and it is really important and because when I I I we need to be okay with the dollar Lama was once asked\nThe dollar law I'm over like the ...\nThe ... yeah it was once asked if he were elected president of the United states what would you do what was the first thing you do and he said the first thing I Would do is start calling things by their proper names and that is so important\nTo understand reality when when you say something like Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan cared about fiscal responsibility\nThey did while they're acting they cared about promoting those\nGet the flavor and satisfaction of smoking without the mess of cigarette ash borer lingering odor switched due to check out J.

ridiculous I mean a calculation\nBoth going to be as easy breezy\nDay and you're on the first time caller long time\nAnd you were invited to join the conversation\nLet me give you are listening\nTalk [noise] [noise]\nI Love your back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a\nMonthly fee\nLooking back to do on the radio show a fruit and article here it was rather interesting stimulated\nThought processes says what are the top ten markets for long term investing as in single family housing I think they're talking about or maybe not might be multiple them housing also [noise] um\nBut the concept was an interesting one to me and they they produce this a proposal theory there or whatever it is that\nWhen you're looking for a long term market to invest in you should be looking for a market in middle range of rent and growth and rate growth in value growth and the theory is if you were in the booming markets\nLike in the past we've had Florida was booming California's blooming or whatever or Phoenix for a while was booming back in two thousand six two thousand seven they were just on hooked [noise]\nUm that those booming markets are the ones that are most susceptible to any type of a recession that those numbers will come crashing down because their balloon numbers are artificially too high\nThen to say if you're in a really deep recession state\nRight um the question is will it come out of that recession or not how long before it comes out of that recessed condition a ... and that might be yet ever right so if you got very low in sluggish growth you may get no growth at all or\nYou might end up like Michigan did for a while or Indiana Gary Indiana Detroit somebody's places um where the city's almost closed down some percentage of the whole city and you could lose everything so what they're sayings moderate growth cities now they go on to\nBring up this next term that's rather interesting to see if I can find that term for quick and that is um income pricing calculations and what they're saying is\nWhat you look for what they're looking for for their long term investments is a city where the cost of living\nA is equivalent to the growth of single family or multi family housing costs have house let's just put it that way\nSo if you live in a city where you can work an average job and afford to pay an average housing check bill income red mortgage whatever\nThen that is sustainable to that area will continue to grow at a moderate rate of growth but a sustainable rate of growth for a long period of time it's not blowing up and it's not dying\nSo that's what they say they're looking for and they're basing it off this ratio between income and housing costs so I thought about that for ... you know\nI I I've seen when you get in the bottom and\nGet into an area and I bought into that area and did nothing for long periods of time uh I've also bought into areas that were down that gave me an opportunity for good growth because maybe the ... the area was in transition maybe it was an area that was what they call re gentrifying changing\nRepositioning itself\nI'm I've been in areas that were overheated\nAnd I've never really liked overheated areas because you pay way too much to buy stuff and so I've never really bought into I mean I've seen him not been in them but I've seen him and I got out I've always got out right when things get super super super hot because to me rule number one is don't lose money\nAnd if there's going to be a you know there's going to be a bust I don't want to be in that asset when there's a bust on that asset so when things get super super hot I tend to sell take my profits you know and hey wouldn't it be great if you know when the market was coming up\nGet in and stay in it until he got up to just about where he got too hot and get out that's been my success for twenty seven Thirty years who investing in real estate I get in when it's low to moderate and I get out before it becomes fire hot\nSo I never buying speculation\nRight I'm never buying speculation yet over the past years I've learned because when I first started I bought really low price really bad area of properties I've learned that that's not that good either\nBecause the problems and the challenges with those areas are not worth it in the long run I did my best on my moderate properties all the stuff I bought in the middle\nEast and it was beautiful stuff in it started in Nineteen Seventy eight construction\nAnd went all the way to Nineteen eighty five construction Seventy to eighty five those eras those modern ... which were either see will be product seeded the product\nIs where I made my ... that's where I got rich quite honestly my millions came from those properties that era and so I tend to believe these guys who got it now they've given us ten areas they think are the best possible see if we get enough time to get through these ten\nA number ... ... what I don't know if they're in particular there's got ten that are best Las Vegas\nA has a percent price increase in two thousand sixteen eleven percent two thousand Seventeen has a one percent variance between housing costs and income Sacramento, California had a southern ... percent last year ten percent this year Minneapolis, Minnesota had five percent last year ... percent this year\nA Ogden, Utah went from eight to ten Fort Worth went from nine to eleven\nGrand Rapids went from eight to ten Portland went from five to eight Boston went from six to eight in Columbus ohio went from seven to eight and all of these areas\nHad less than eight ten percent variance between cost of living and income and some of them actually had a negative\nVariants which means it was really cheaper to live there they are you really got paid more than what you could afford to live there very easily as in other words it's a positive thing\nSo if that's the case what we're going to do was get herself has some good solid middle line real estate investments that are going just so solidly maintain their growth over a long period of time and that will soon\nBut your family's wealth for your entire generation\nThat's all you need that periodically you're in the changes you're going to change to remember real strict like a trade you could hear ... which will kill one day a wonderful

ecologically friendly\nOkay so what how do they get the idea where who inspired it why would you make it illegal to throw out your food\nThe law was inspired by a twenty Fifteen study to analyze what's in Austin trash oh I bet that was fun I bet that was some fund research just picking through syringes and condoms in any number of stuff leftover from South by southwest I don't even want to know what they had to touch\nIn order to conduct this study but okay so they go through ...\nAnd they included the thirty seven percent of the garbage that sent to landfills garbage sent to landfills thirty seven percent of it\nUm comes from businesses throwing away organic food waste\nFood you know like\nLike a taco somebody didn't finish this is Austin we're talking about after all and they and they feel in Austin that that food could have been composting okay sure compost heap stinky and smelly but I'm All right that's fine you want to do a compost heap I don't have a problem with that uh your property I guess or they want the food to be donated\nDonating the food donating youth sushi donating you sushi no no no no no and no disgusting no thanks that is that's gross I mean I'm\nI'm not

leftover sushi like hey\nHey man you got anything I can eat here oh well I just have this California roll but I'm allergic to them and so it's just the ... yeah delicious okay the last time I checked there's nobody starving in the streets of Austin, Texas I Know I Know we're led to believe that people are still starving\nIn the streets but for the most part I I'm going to say something very very harsh and very honest in very real and some of you aren't going to like it\nA lot of homeless people or they're out on the streets because they've they've chosen to be there either they're junkies and drug addicts and they don't want to be in the shelters where it's possible they have some mental health issues that just makes them not want to adapt to normal life life and you know you and I get up

died in a helicopter crash\nUp in Wisconsin of all places that you very much Chris steamy rave on died way too soon he wouldn't be in his sixties he was a young man he when he died I think he was Thirty years I mean way too young and the poor guy was flying\nIn a helicopter and he just never got home and much like that other famous story about the big bopper and um who else was on that airplane that was the big bopper\nAnd uh what was it Frankie valley or whatever you know that they they there were people that could have got on the plane who didn't get on the plane and same with Leonard scattered and my understanding was there were people that could have gone on the Stevie rave on helicopter who didn't and then they live so that must have been depressing for them anyway\nA couple of my buddies came by the radio station today we'll get back to Austin you just one second\nAnd they brought these signs I\nThe problem with Facebook Live we're live right now on Facebook Live and the problem with Facebook Live\nOr you could see me in the studio right now if anybody's in their office and they're bored and listening to the show and you're curious go ahead and go to the ... the producer Kenny page the Facebook my my Facebook page and you'll find a link to the live stream well the problem with Facebook Live as it takes the video and it flips it around so it's in reverse like you're looking in the mirror\nAnyway so there are these guys they're young conservatives here in Houston really funny guys and they're handing out the signs that say and they look just like the ... work yard signs and the ... yard signs say\nHis name is Robert do look not ... he's a hundred percent Irish American he's zero percent Hispanic hash tag\nRobert so Rourke like the um you know like phone lights like fake like French or whatever or ... you know that's more you're more your speed anyway I find that to be awesome you can find them online I Want to keep that signed by me while I'm On the air well that stay up here can you see that close enough yeah you can kind of see it the gist of it there anyway\nThis is not a this is not a show that exclusively for people on Facebook Live so let's get back to the audio portion of the talk radio show and I just want to address the fact\nThat in Austin right now they passed another silly law so I started asking you guys and and probably in the truck or wanted to weigh in on this Brian\nShould it be a law you were telling me about the advantage of compost jeeps and you're not against composting and neither am I that's fine Rand Paul has one in his yard I guess part of the reason why Rand Paul's like leftist extremist neighbor was mad at him\nWas because of a compost heap and a pumpkin patch but it was really about politics we all know that anyway so I digress\nBrian should it be a law should it be a law that you have to use the compost [noise]\nNo not at all and that's ridiculous but at the same time what I wanted it back that'll into a long time ago my grandfather used to go to grocery stores and pick up all bread and cheese and things of that nature and take it up to community centers to be distributed\nMhm then laws are passed in the grocery stores exactly pork bleach on that stuff when it goes outside and the doctor and they couldn't give it away I Am so that my grandfather I\nI'm so glad you told that story for two reasons Brian number one it's ridiculous that that happens and what he's what he's saying is the truth and number two here in Houston, Texas just like you're just like in San Antonio we have a launch Houston, Texas it's very rarely enforced\nBut it says that it's illegal to feed the homeless now I Know a lot of you were thinking illegal to feed the homeless well why would that be a law you know when you're sitting at a red light and you're looking at your take out from what a burger or you know you're you're you're half eaten burger\nFrom Jaycee I grill or whatever you just said some delicious Coney dog or whatever and you're thinking I Can't finish this I'm going to give it to this whole though that's walking up to me well that's against the law technically in Houston it's a ticket to build a fence\nWhat's the point what's the point of that well they would prefer that these homeless people go to the food shelter which again just kind of gets back to my point before there's really nobody starving in the streets in Houston people I I'm actually surprised that no one's called up to argue with me about that but ... and you're right that's that's the point you wanted to make and I totally agree with you on\nThe other one is Americans can wait rightfully say what we put in our body you know I mean for someone else to sit there and say no you can't eat that because that's their free\nYeah ridiculous brains totally\nRight there is a similar thing happening right now with vape pens there's a big company and what's it called jewels it's called jewels I think right I I don't ...\nBut I Know that a lot of you do and yesterday the FDA rated this office building where this popular vapor pen company exists I you know it's a it's an alternative to tobacco it's an alternative to nicotine consumption if you're trying to get off cigarettes\nVapor pens or a pretty good way to go my buddy brand and Darby senior editor at Breitbart Texas chain smoked for over Twenty years and then one day he switched to ... and he's never he's never looked back\nShe quit smoking and now and now we only have so little ... such a great way to get off smoking but I don't know if the FDA would would uh I don't know if the FDA would endorse the comment I just made but my understanding of it is that's pretty much true and if anybody out there needs to quit smoking you know it's something to consider even still the FBI the FDA rated their office yesterday because\nThey were upset about the fact that a lot of teenagers are getting into ... and they wanted to see what kind of internal memos could we find that this office that might suggest\nThat maybe they're trying to get teams debate well for the most part you know we we don't we don't know this but for the most part they're not putting out ads that say hey under age kids ... is the coolest so it got it all just goes back to what Brian was just saying Brian great call I'm Glad you called call anytime man hey more calls coming in rain where are you calling from\nUm I like to talk of what a Massachusetts wow you can't imagine\nHow are you hearing us today on on a radio or Facebook Live\nUm I was in a Facebook Live but I've just been so now I'm going to the phone\nOh okay cool man I appreciate that I'm Glad to have you ah I'm Glad to have you as a listener man what's what's life like up in Massachusetts and how did you find our show\nI'm actually I'm In ... so that kind of how I found out there so sure right\nAlong and listen to Michael very traumatic hatch John I just got to see if I'm walking the dog thing and get the happiness and\nThanks dude I Love having you as a listener and rest in peace map Patrick I always like to throw this out I Know a lot of you listeners already know this but if anybody out there was a loyal ... Patrick listener and you were part of the sand box a sand box the un's get first get first dibs so let let my producer now that you're a sand box in\n... for those you are Matt Patrick listeners you'll know what that means and for those who don't understand maybe your new listeners map Patrick was a good friend of ours that used to be in this time slot a couple of years back and he passed away after a long bout with cancer and anyway so so brave you spent time in Austin\nUm that's something that's moving their four oh there are um\n... for law school after I graduate\nHere mhm well\nYeah and they are hearing that we're hearing that on it I said okay at work I mean if I moved out to be under their law if I don't know I'm legally affect us right today\nWhat are you are you going to college in Massachusetts I I I guess yeah I Am\nI Am I ... I\nKnow I get it yeah no it's okay I kinda was self explanatory so first of all very awesome that you're studying law and that you have aspirations to do that my understanding is that you'd see is a great law program in fact you just mentioned Michael berry I think Michael berry went to law school there that was one of the places where he went\nI think look dude I'm going to be honest with you I've been picking on Austin is all show I like Austin I think it's a fun town to hang out in\n... I like I like food trucks and I like a\nStreet musicians I think it's a fun place to hang out they just have all these silly laws when you put artists and musicians in charge of a community", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
