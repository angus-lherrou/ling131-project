hacked into there's no other explanation\nWe we have our we have a people we have we've hired Robert Mueller to investigate this and figure out why the video feed will not work\nRobert Mueller is working feverishly James Comey is involved James Comey is you're right now isn't that right say hello James\nIt's weird how your voice is so high pitched James I don't know how your voice kind of like that so interesting anyway and other news you may have heard about this today where there are\nThings happening besides our studio being hacked by Russians today I Know it's big news by a\nTeam of investigators entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier today\nFor what Turkish officials called a joint inspection of the building where Saudi journalist he's a he's an American Jamal 'cause soggy disappeared nearly two weeks ago guy wrote for the Washington Post it's been claimed there was a report that he went into the consulate and he was murdered\nAnd reports on that very a bit I've seen some dark explanations out there on the Internet for what happened to him um I won't even begin to try to figure it out but the team arrived by on marked police cars at the council and said nothing to journalists waiting outside as they entered the building\nPolice Bush back the journalist from the front of the conflict they've been out there for days these people it's just like the protest to Kavanaugh these guys would standing out there for days they don't know what's going on everybody wants to know what's up\nAnd now they're supposed to be some joint investigation happening I'm skeptical at us the latest report um is is that Saudi is going to admit to killing the journalists during interrogations this was a new report from CNN\nBut remember this is CNN so kind of take that as a grain of SALT I don't it's not that I don't believe that that's what would happen\nI totally believe that it's possible that that is a very likely explanation but when CNN is the source point you've got to be skeptical about this I mean we all know\nWe all know how often they are misleading on things like this they had an interview with Donald Trump on sixty minutes over the weekend and they asked about this they almost kind of asked him about this as if they were blaming him\nI'm I'm not really sure that it's fair to blame Donald Trump for this but you know how the media will blame them for anything\nThe media what was the media will blame Donald Trump for this missing journalist if they thought they could get away with it because you know why why not it's a it's a fun story for them it's fun for their viewers to believe that Donald Trump is somehow involved in this part of the reason why they're mad at my wife CBS would even suggest\nThis journalist missing in in ... in in Turkey that disappeared at the consulate there is somehow the fault of Donald Trump is because they think Donald Trump as a friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia it's almost like they've never seen those photos Brock Obama bowing down\nTo the king of Saudi Arabia Saudi crown prince anyway so here's Donald Trump on CBS on sixty minutes yesterday being asked about the missing journalist and I'm a computer ...\nMiles a shovel the journalist's journalist was he murdered by the Saudis and did the prince given the order to kill him\nWhen nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated it's being looked at very very strongly and we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it and then he denied the mentally couldn't be them yes\nChallenger son in law just got on the phone and asked the prince\nDid he didn't deny deny it they denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer what are your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed\nWhat depends on what the sanctions or give me an example they ordering military weapons\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it\nChina wanted we wanted it we got it and we got all of it every bit of it would you cut

New York times this is a Breitbart it's not the gateway pond in the New York times Democrats\nDo not support a border wall and they don't support the deportation of violent illegal I'm not talking about the regularly illegals I'm not talking about Consuelo the cleaning lady or you know our Omar\nThe polish repair guy or you know even right what would remain the Chinese laundry Matt employee or

guys heard about\nStacey Abrams Stacey Abrams is the gubernatorial candidates from Port up\nShe said something amazing yesterday\nOver the weekend she was doing the rounds on the cable TV talking had shows and she said the blue way it was coming and it's coming because of illegal immigrants more want what why did you get what that means folks what she's saying and the sound bite is that the Democrats are going to win\nNext month of November because undocumented illegal immigrants are going to vote would you turn the computer and places like\nThe thing that is a blue wave is African American [laughter]\nThat's why it's not like the guy I\nNot worthy of the\nDocument even documented\nWow it's comprised of what\nI guess that I mean she's being honest with their constituents I guess maybe she wants to lie to the press it just seems like a pretty big news story\nA high ranking member of the Democratic party is out there telling people that the Democrats are going to win 'cause they're gonna cheat\nSo your Google Stacey Abrams name\nSomething kind of suspicious happens here you don't see any news stories about this you literally see none um\nNews story I just did a Google Search air Stacey Abrams declines to endorse Eric Holder's controversial kicked comment Stacey Abrams were Stacey Abrams stands on transportation is issues Stacey Abrams heads out on a bus tour these are nice headlines but where's the big news story this is a pretty big news story\nIn the meantime this woman thanks voter ID laws are meant to scare people out of boating\nNo voter ID laws are supposed to keep people from voting illegally and that's it you mean of voter id\nIf you need an id to vote it it it seems like a pretty easy justification to me we don't want people to cheat on voting right think about it you need an ID to get a welfare check you know an idea to buy a gun you need an idea to drive a car\nYou mean id to go outside and get some cigarettes you need an ID to get sued affect you need an idea to drive a moped right don't you in some states I think that's not an all of them are the point is that smokes\nAn idea to get people to vote isn't supposed to be racist there's nothing racist about it unless of course you are trying to encourage people to cheat\nAnd then I guess it is [laughter] I [laughter] I Can't even believe there's an argument about this this this stuff the Democrats actually agreed on back in the nineties when their guy Bill Clinton was pro build a wall and pro immigration reform and now they're against all this stuff\nWell it turns out there is a good reason that we want these laws for women in Fort\nWorth or have been arrested and indicted on charges related to an organized voter fraud with\nWhat they do they exploited old people this happened in Texas this happened at Fort Worth four women were arrested here's what their names were Letitia Sanchez Letitia Sanchez ...\nThey have the same name but like an extra last may and I guess Maria solace and more ... they were indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud\nThe attorney general's office as these people allegedly were paid to target older voters on the north side of the city in Fort Worth it was a scheme that was supposed to generate a large number of mail ballots they were going to harvest those ballots for specific candidates and twenty sixteen\nGosh I Wonder which candidates I Wonder if they were Tea Party candidates [laughter] I Wonder if they were neo cons I doubt it the attorney general's office explains that the applications\nFor mail in ballots are first sent a targeted precincts been harvester is attempt to either intercept the ballots outright or assist elderly voters in voting in their ballots\nWhile ensuring that the votes are cast for the candidates harvester choice oh well gosh\nSound like they're doing something illegal to me man in a lot of cases the attorney general's office official says the voters do not even know their votes have been stolen investigators began looking into a Fort Worth voter fraud rang and found that the so called fraudulent applicants are applications were created by forging signatures\nThey changed information on the applications and then they would reach submit them without the knowledge of the voters they didn't even tell these people oh yeah we changed your vote re submitted it don't worry about it you're old just sit in the home and shut up about it speaking of shut up can somebody tell Hollywood to shut up Hollywood\nIs never short on this a disappointment I got this new movie out

claims that a professor at Stanford\nCan prove that she's a Native American won five hundred twelve Native American [laughter] which which is so vague and specific that you almost wonder like why even bother\nIf there's if a grain of this is true just just go to DNA dot com and take a test publish it then\nWhy is it that she had to have the test conducted with somebody from a a a a university with a history of liberal bias\nNo ... razor seems to give us the answer on that\nShe probably not being honest I don't know I don't know this professor I don't want to suggest that he's lying but this is a real problem right now an academic ya\nIf it's happening at other universities if it's happened in so many academic journals if it's happening all these colleges around the country why are we to believe that one DNA test taking well after the fact by Elizabeth Warren verifies that her legitimacy because it's probably not true it's probably not true at all\n[noise] suit of happiness radio it's

Donald Trump challenged her to take well yesterday morning Trump responded he said he hopes that Elizabeth Warren runs for president because she'd be very easy to beat\nA Trump was asked to react to a DNA test Warren performed that apparently shows she has some tiny smidgen of Native American heritage or a new Trump is nicknamed Pocahontas\nWas challenged by the president in July to take a DNA test you took her down till now to do it we've been talking about this for years I mean folks it's almost November why did it take her so long to take this DNA test he challenged her back in July we should add the results by August max it doesn't take long to take a DNA test right you just go\nYou know did give a little blood sample or urine sample to or somebody they run it through the analytics or spit saliva\nAnyway Trump offered to donate a hundred bucks to her favorite charity and that he might have to do that now of course I if he has as much money as he claims he probably doesn't care who cares he said Trump responded as he held a press availability a press conference before boarding marine one he said I didn't say you better read that again the Trump said about the million dollar challenge\nUm I think he did actually [laughter] I I I kind of thought that is what he said didn't did he not say that\nWorrying went on Twitter and she said my family including Fox News watchers sat together and talked about what they think real Donald Trump's attack on our heritage and yes a famous geneticists analyze my DNA included that contains Native American ancestry\nVaguely Elizabeth Warren if it's even true\nIf it's even true then it's just a smidgen of Native American heritage\nProbably you shouldn't be calling it our heritage you you share a little in common with Native Americans or if you're a Ninety five percent European for the most part your heritage is a group of people that went to war with the Native Americans and took their land away and by the way this happened hundreds of years ago I'm not at all suggesting that you know that\nThat history history is unfair to lots of people I mean fine ... it it certainly is true that that's the case and that's unfortunate\nBut we can't change the past and ... ... people feel ashamed about the fact that hundreds of years ago somebody lost a war we had nothing to do with that\nI I have a lot of respect\nFor Native Americans and you know I think it's really cool ha Sam Houston was an honorary Native American did you all know that this little community that we live in Houston, Texas is pretty cool history

drew opposed to session in the lead up to the civil war\n\nDidn't work though I mean we know what happened next and he was very old by that point that was really at the end of his life from the civil

the point of going public with this anyway [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah it's a it's a bit baffling but ah but hey it's\nThese are the times we're living in folks this is the world we live and you know in Tony fourteen I made a stupid comedy bit called trans racial transracial usa that was what it was called and it jokingly pretended that some people might want to identify as a different race than the ones they were born as in the year later Rachel Dole is all became a national news story\nMight joke became real\nSimilarly in August twenty sixteen I made a parity about trans species people someone who identifies as a different species\nWhat now there's a national news story about Tony bark the biological woman who identifies as a male dog I'm not saying I'm ... I'm not but I'm very good at predicting where the the looney left is going to pay that next time I don't know I guess I have a gift\n[noise] you're watching the learning channel\nWelcome to another episode of American Parenthood today we mean Becky and her four year old son Sparky from Cleveland, Ohio Becky and Sparky are just like most mothers in son's except for one miner difference Sparky identifies as adult [laughter]\nRealized he died at age three we're watching TV when all of a sudden that Pakistan had ...

your bill great customer service over Ninety percent retention for a reason\nEight seven seven Ninety three eagle eight seven seven Ninety three eagle you see do you like some of them are ones that are there for\nMore money than the men on a mission to read one version of what I'm saying\nWe're back with the Dell wants a radio show this is Len Merlin today we'd been working on your financial freedom during our conversation with Peggy in Leo and how they've distinguish some of the timeless life lessons that will help us succeed uh from the ideas that we need to transform it into ...\nIn order to make our dreams and our desires of reality and so they grew up in entrepreneurial families ah Peggy grew up with some some belief systems about I'm being debt free very common in in some entrepreneurial families\nI'm Leo grew up with commercial real estate seeing the power of real estate but never really being taught the power of real estate\nAnd they both ended up in corporate jobs um and doing a variety of things Peggy made her way to the top and and retired pretty much when her her salary cap to Leo had his own business\nBut didn't want to grow it any further it has to end at some point unless you just want to work in the business until the day you die unless you're going to create a huge team and then manage that team and it wasn't something Li I wanted to do\nAnd so now with all this life experience they found themselves you know looking out on on to the horizon in uncharted territory and cast about a little bit and we're really looking for something enduring something where they can find their place in the world\nWhere they could use the things they that they had learned and transform\nAll of that and to a great retirement living the life they wanted which didn't include managing people\n... working in a business right Leo I'm so tell us a little bit out about the results you've had you know you you joined lifestyles unlimited you've been members for a couple of years now and talk to us about how your life is now and what you're doing on a day to day basis as a result\nLynn I I Love it I mean we don't have to worry about fighting the traffic [laughter] um we uh\nYou know we office out of our homes um\nWe just have kind of a piece about is um the thing about it we have learned a skill set on how to invest in apartment complexes and I never dreamed I always thought if you are going to be a passive investor in an apartment that you had to bathe or an institutional investors\nAre from the very wealthy family and we're not on a more small guys and actually we're in an apartment complex that uh you know almost like eight hundred units I mean we're a tiny percentage fraction and the deal\nBut we've been able to get into that deal\nAnd really I mean I think about if one of which got sick couldn't work or maybe both of us\nThat the money that we're making the passive income keeps coming in so we don't have to worry about that because there's somebody leading the projects the late investor which I bake in the industry most firms column sponsor investors they're taking care of everything there\nThey're finding the apartment complex they're managing it are finding somebody to manager for them so\nWe just have a certain case about us than we know we're we're going and and really\nAs we get into details and we re fi\nUm the deal then that means that like let's say I'm just doing an arbitrary figure let's say we put a hundred thousand and we might on a race I get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that deal but we're able to use the money from the re fi to get into more details so our first year we were able to get into an\nApartment complexes will now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the ...\nAre are selling and so we right now we own sixteen because we've sold one and that was a situation where we did what they call it ten thirty one at strange and that's where\nYou had we had a complex and we tried it up\nAnd in this case we traded up to two more complex as well okay so let's say we put a hundred thousand in that first um apartment complex as an investment well we had an equity gain of Seventy one percent so when we do that first complex and tried it up into two\nMore complex because we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there and we went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand too too complex there's which total about um\nA five hundred unit I think the two hundred thousand we went from the complex with two hundred units too too complex but equal five hundred unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like it it was\nOn one of 'em they occupancy was eighty three percent and the late investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other conflicts that we tried it into we found out that oracle was moving within a half mile of our investment\nAnd they were bringing in five thousand employs so it's it's just been great or start started about it\n[noise]\nLeo and what is it done for you now how is it has it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing before\nOr ... you know funny or just the other day I remember about it and it was oh west or their order\nAnd it was maybe about ... park after I'd gotten up at eight thirty and started getting up but you know six o'clock Wal Mart and I'm a ... and um I thought\nYou know what they thought I Want to go get gas\nBut here I Am but not ... or ... such a beautiful the gasoline I'd do it I Want I bought ... and I've thought about my swimming certain\nTown I go swimming swimming half a mile a I'm a ... a comeback\nAnd then you know and then there's a really really awful yeah ... or ... or ...\nOr at least on the Internet you can look up so much and stuff and um\nAnd then also that's what you are a lot going back and talk and call and we'll leave investor and finding out more about\nRight after you you didn't do anything to do it on and we are right you can do all the

Trump call Stormy Daniels horse race on Twitter if you've\nBeen on social media and the last hour or two you already know about this people are losing their minds Donald Trump called Stormy Daniels for space and this is the same woman who describes\nDonald Trump's genitals is maybe\nBeing shaped like the mushroom from Super Mario brothers right wasn't that what they were saying I haven't read the book but apparently that's in stormy Daniels' book okay so both of these things are going out of the same time the both of these people slept with each other\nBoth of them are attacking each other's physical attributes now I just want to rewind the hands of time a little bit let's turn back the sand in the hour glass I was young ones\nI can remember a time when I was in college I was in high school and guys and girls would insult each other's looks and then a short time later those two people would end up dating each other again\nNow I'm not saying that Donald Trump is going to date Stormy Daniels or when there's clearly still some sexual tension between those two I mean if this it's it's totally evidence why else would you behave this way what else would make you want me to look\nShe's a professional uh you know sex address he's the most powerful man in the world men are generally very attracted to large ... and blonde hair that's obviously popular in the porno industry ... ... it is a breakup thing right women are very my producer Chris says it's a breakup that\nWomen are very attracted to power women like men were powerful people often wonder you know why didn't Janet Reno [laughter] why wasn't Janet Reno attracted to men attractive demand the way the bill Clinton was attracted to a fact of the women are [laughter] I got to be careful about that there well I think we all know the reason\nWhy Bill Clinton was a powerful man some progressive Democrat women were attractive ... nobody's gonna be attracted to Janet Reno men are attracted to power they're attracted if there's ... ... maybe money and John Kerry skate didn't name areas for money anyway so that's where we are now that's where we are with all this silly silly nonsense\nAnd and as all this
