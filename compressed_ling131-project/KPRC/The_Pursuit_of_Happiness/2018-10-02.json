Kevin are really a virgin in college or did he lie about that now you don't know okay hey did Brett Kavanaugh ever get so drunk that he attacked somebody you know you don't know All right so they do all the research right and then they get to the point where they say\nAll right the FBI as concluded that we couldn't find any determinative you know ... offended of evidence you know something something that would that would absolutely justify or warrant keeping him off the Supreme Court according to these allegations the smoking gun the thing the Democrats are waiting for\nThe Democrats then respond to that and go oh well I guess we were wrong about that we better better go ahead and could from Brett Kavanaugh I\nKnow of course not that has nothing to do with it they're they're just pissed off about Neil Gorsuch there just pissed off about losing the election they're upset about so many things the book the blue wave is not coming and they know it so this is that this is all they've got right now they have to prove a small\nTo a small outspoken minority that they're willing to fight and they and they don't have anything to fight with they didn't bring any weapons to the brawl so instead all they can deal with is hyperbole a sensationalism and and farfetched claims right anyway so now they're getting what they want here they're getting the FBI investigation that they asked for\nAnd interestingly enough I as soon as this came out\nThey first I Know it doesn't need to be a complicated investigation that really doesn't okay okay how are you sure yeah yeah just a simple investigation we just want to know and the second the FBI investigation started\nThe Democrats change their tone I mean like that you could set your watch to it the minute it happened the Democrats came out and well the FBI is not investigating hard enough we needed expanse of investigation that needs to go on for months yeah we know that's what you want that's all you want it this whole time\nAll you really care about is getting this to go until the midterms in November\nRight so they're going to get what they want probably I I'm beginning to think more and more every day that this passes\nThat this might actually make it to ... terms it's October now guys we all know an election day comes it's in early November the first week midterms are right around the corner I mean think about how quickly uh how ... how ... what a short time ago it was August\nIt's October now it's going to be November before you know it do you really think the Democrats don't have the patience to keep this up until November I kinda feel like they do anyway so Trump's giving them what they want and they're going to get it in the meantime for irony here that Dianne Feinstein of all the people was the one sounding the alarm on this Dianne Feinstein\nUpset that she wasn't getting an FBI investigation hey you old ... year old ... with your your turkey neck Banshee you had the possibility to get the FBI investigation way before anybody even knew about this she had the report she had the documents she had the letter for Christine Blasey Ford\nShe could've handed that over to the FBI then this investigation could have already been happening it wasn't there was no law enforcement involvement because of Dianne Feinstein and the fact that she stalled and delayed on it this is peak irony right here and I don't think that this lady sit on the report for months\nBut she's the same woman who had a Chinese spies working it's her personal driver for what was the decades that was going on for years how about an FBI investigation\nInto that huh I'm curious what Dianne Feinstein is real connection to China looks like hey speaking of speaking of investigation somebody else's calling for an investigation now Lindsey\nGraham Lindsey Graham wants an investigation into the Democrats now this is very interesting very specific group of Democrats\nThat the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats All right so what would they investigate well first of all it would be interesting to know if Christine Blasey Ford really is the uninvolved Politico that they claim or if in fact she she's an active liberal Democrat as the as the evidence seemed to suggest\nI've seen reports that she was that the women's march and I've seen all kinds of things all kinds of claims made about this woman on the Internet which she's a Democrat donor and what's the real truth well an investigation would answer some of those questions\nUm there was a photo going around on line of her with Hillary Clinton I don't know if that's real I don't necessarily believe that it is but um but if anybody can correct me on that head give me a call him you know seven when three two one two five nine five oh I Would like to see an investigation into Dianne Feinstein wouldn't you with all the resources with all the money that we spend as taxpayers\nNot only for all these useless federal branches and agencies of of the government\nBut to pay the salaries of all these elitist establishment inside the beltway lawmakers wouldn't it be great if we could use our resources just to investigate them\nI Would have no problem with that instead of investigating I don't know if people pirated music on the Internet or whatever the FBI's busy doing lately people downloading illegal copies of Fort Night or whatever however we investigate that\nI Want to know what Dianne Feinstein is up to I ... and here's another great question\nWhile we're talking about Lindsey Graham's idea to investigate them who the heck leads to that report to the Washington Post well somebody had two guys the Washington Post is pretty good at guessing and making up facts sometimes they've done it in the past but something tells me this was awfully specific\nHow did the Washington Post no that Christine Blasey Ford was that was the cabinet user\nWow I mean I'm not a betting man but I Would suspect if you could pick up the phone and call somebody in Vegas and put all your money on red red in this case would be the Dianne Feinstein and who's this other check from uh\nFrom Hawaii senator her own oh yeah they definitely know how that information out to the Washington Post if you don't believe that I mean I've got some magic beans for sale in my car come meet me after the show I'll give you a great price on um you're going to save a lot of money on magic being senator minding your own oh she was enraged\nShe was one of the most vocal opponents of Brett Kavanaugh and\nSo she's doing this interview the other day where she was she on ABC's This week over the weekend with George Stephanopoulos who ironically enough is also a Clinton insider who was the press secretary for Bill Clinton alright so it's a such a Democrat interviewing a Democrat and George Stephanopoulos asks are\nUm are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how do you respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer Dr ... do a lawyer\nI mean there's those are great question I'm I'm kind of a price that George Stephanopoulos was bold enough to ask those questions especially if you consider that he's interviewing someone who he clearly has a\nI'm so tired of the crap out of just sitting around ... you know Republicans start getting you know maybe the light a fire underneath that lady for a lot she laughed off every single thing that she\nGoes I hear you got a what's\nIt looked at that law from the one that was ...\nRight right I heard that too yeah and it's yeah and it's not a coincidence and apparently her her brother cells abortion pills or something like I was\nSurprised me she probably eight twenty of\nA subject they might get what you're saying they clearly have a horse in this race to the will to suggest that she is biased is completely misleading so I so I take it you're a yes then on the investigation right Brian I'll\nSay burn every out that the five to\n... before I hang up on you Brian who you're voting for November ...\nOh [laughter]\nAll right right on I appreciate your one more one more brisket dinner or tacos\nAre both together\nI Love that I Love that answer grading answer Brian the truck or a driving a sweet piece of machine out there\nAre settling three two one two five nine five oh I see your calls coming in I Want to get to him real quick though by the way I see a vested issued takes place I Want you to hear the voice of James Earl Jones in your head saying this is CNN as I play this clip for you\nHere's Kris Cuomo of CNN and the fantastic investigation work he does oh I Can't the fact that this guy doesn't have a job at the CIA CIA he's\nBaffling to me listen listen to the hard super sleuth work of course Cuomo asking some lady who went to college with Brett Kavanaugh about what ... was like in college\nAnd I have to tell you I don't believe it's disqualifying to a party in high school or in college but him and telling the truth about himself huh is more relevant standard was Brett Kavanaugh known as ... as a version\n[noise] I Know I\nKnow I just I just want to know because that's something he points out about himself that I Know having gone to the same school and it's not so big it's ... it's got a big name but it's not that big a community it's pretty small it's a kind of thing that would have been no\nPrint Chris Cuomo first asked the dumbest questions he's interviewing a woman who vaguely knew Brett Kavanaugh's college than it is hard hitting question is hey\nWas ... Kavanaugh version and she's like look I don't know I just knew the guy and then he has to justify asking the stupid question by saying\nWell uh I I Know a thing or two about Yale and if it if my understanding of you is correct\nAnd he was a version of the people would have known about it to Chris we're kind of creep argue I think most people are going to jail or probably pretty busy I don't know keeping up with their scholastic they're reading in their academic or an\nAcademic aspirations to do the hard hitting research to figure out\nHow many of my classmates or virgins oh Chris Cuomo will wonders never sees hey we're getting more calls have you guys want to get it on the seven when three two one two\nFive nine five oh five nine fifty that's what we're supposed to say because it's been nine fifty that's a radio station a singer\nPeterson how are you I'm good Ken how're you doing\nReally good I always love when you call me for two reasons first of all you're one of my best

viral blog post to keep your see radio dot com if you guys have never read what a senior Peterson's article she's brilliant Michel ... says Michael berry there's a reason why Sanders as good as she is\nSending what do you make about all this uh all this brouhaha today what do you think about the investigation is\nWell the the investigation is a ... you know last week everybody was saying that that Rachel Mitchell really didn't help to Republicans case at all um but then she put together this memo and uh it's uh it's actually a nine page memo because it's got a timeline on it\nBut basically she just kinda says you know twenty five year sex crimes prosecutor I I did it for a living and when she laid it out you could start to see all of the holes in in the story and and one of the things you know I Know where they granted is calling for an investigation into the Democrats on the committee\nAbout who actually leaked the a letter\nFrom from Fort Dianne Feinstein on and and here's here's an interesting time line on July the six Ford spoke with her congressional representatives office at lady by the name of on an issue that's her her Congress critter and so she kind of wanted to reach out to them to kind of ask\nWhat she should do\nThen later that day is Ford text the Washington Post tip line using what's it\nAnd that's where she identified her attacker Brett Kavanaugh on mark\nJudge and that he did with the bystander and she says she quote shouldn't be quiet\nAbout her allegations ... did not write to Dianne\nFeinstein until the end of July somewhere between the twentieth and the thirtieth of July a right to Dianne Feinstein\nShe'll break down the details or what do you fix this all means\nI think this means that I'm Christine for decided that she was going to take some incident from her past and somehow\nWork in a um [noise] you know an accusation against the guy who it is\nThat considered for Supreme Court yeah um I don't know whether or not she actually told her therapist that his name I'm doubtful um and it's funny that the Washington Post to see some of her therapist nuts but apparently Congress hasn't\nYou know the the notes from her therapist apparently never mentioned Kavanaugh at least not them they don't never mentioned\nYeah no it it's very interesting\nUm I've actually one of my friends have longest standing basically tells me to go pounds than when I tell her that I didn't find a good thing or\nA testimony credible particularly after I read this memo that Rachel Mitchell could out I mean because she was really clear she says here's where I have a problem with what she's done and uh there are too many hall to inconsistencies I couldn't even go get a search warrant\nRight sooner I loved that you're willing to stand up and say unpopular things when you when you know them to be true and I feel the same way as well\nA senator Peterson if you have not read her articles a case here see radio dot com you know this topic

I Want to talk more about the uh all the absurdity with the Kavanaugh saying but you know\nWe're getting into that time of year again when you're seeing political ads everywhere it's political ads season it's supposed to be Halloween time but it's not all the way in time because it's political season time well it can be both at once but political ads are getting outrageous they're just not\nThis this is like anything you can do right now in a political ad do attack your enemy even if it doesn't make any sense that's what they're doing now in the left in the left loves sensationalism the right tries to play clean we tried to fight fair and they fight dirty maybe we should be more like the left I don't know\nLeon Black men is a candidate for the people Leon has fought hard for equality for\nThese fought against the pharmaceutical companies\nTo lower prescription drug prices\nTaken on oil and energy companies to make sure they had here to environmental standards because Leon Blackmon believes everyone should have a fair chance and living the American dream ease the right man for us in Washington\nPaid for by Leon Blackmon for Congress\nLay on black men would be a disaster for all of them elected to Congress he want higher taxes\nYou weren't job open borders and he believes healthcare she'd be bringing his deal had been quoted by several publications that socialistic and neo Nazi and female student at his high school one said that during a math whiz in Nineteen eighty seven he looked at her inappropriately\nLeon Black men a Hitler loving sexual predators that we can't afford to send to Washington [noise] paid for by Josh waiting for Congress\nWhoa are you not approve of that anyway those are not real candidates that was just a stupid comedy bit as are all the stupid comedy but you hear on the show\nBut it rings true right there's a familiarity that that isn't that now and every political ad sounds like nowadays\nThe left in the right of both become so predictable our side does at our site is just as bad as they are but they're both predictable and they're both absurd and ridiculous anyway Hollywood has gone full homophobic and ... and full racist\nThey hate black people who speak out in independently of their liberal causes and they have and they hate men who may not be a who may not have come out of the closet with their homosexuality let me give an example when I'm Talking about following Lindsey Graham's passionate defensive judge Brett Kavanaugh this past week a lot of people on the left started making homophobic attacks against the guy\nIn when I say a lot of people I mean high ranking high influential an affluent people from Hollywood\nRosie O'Donnell started the hate train last Wednesday she called grandma closeted idiots\nShe said I a grim got on Twitter and he said I very much believe in allowing people to be heard but I'm not going to play it I'm not going to have my intelligence insulted by Michael ... Michael ... of the world\nAnd Rosie O'Donnell got on Twitter and she said F. you you closeted idiot this is the patriarchy exposed this is reality deal with it hash tag no cabin are confirmation okay and we get it you don't like Trump but\nA attacking Lindsey Graham sexuality hey look jokes are jokes I mean it is what it is you know I'm sure Lindsey Graham to take a little joke but this is Hollywood we're talking about they're the ones that are supposed to be so inclusive and defending gay people it\nShouldn't it be the gay person's right to decide when they come out of the closet assuming Lindsey Graham's gay which he insists he's not I don't know All right well if it was just ... if it was just Rosie would leave it and probably not even comment on it but it's not just rosy there's a lot of this Kathy Griffin joined in the gay\nBashing\nShe referred to Lindsey Graham as if she\nCalled him miss Lindsey Graham now I mean like I made fun of Lindsey for having a girl's name before ... probably the last person that should be pointed this out but again you're the laugh toward the right to your the ones that are supposed to be really cool with the gay people and we're supposed to be the ...\nSo why are you acting the way that you assume we behave\nWhat happened to the left so much ... not to be out on Thursday night Jimmy Kimmel\nAccused Lindsey Graham of fabricated outrage\nAnd then he he took it to a weird place he said he said we weren't Democrats that this is the new normal if this is the way it's going to go they better watch out for their own Supreme Court nominee as if Merrick Garland isn't out there somewhere judging the dog show right now so [noise] chemical\nBasically accusing during some gay bashing here comparing Lindsey Graham to Liberace\nHe said he wants got some camera time somebody somebody must have told them the grand that Donald Trump was watching him because he lit up like someone left to atheism tack on Liberace piano bench\nOh that's funny Jimmy Kimmel I guess I guess gay people are funny when they're not liberals I guess being gay is shameful if you're not a progressive I'm just trying to order in the ... I don't know\nThe rules are confusing it's hard to keep up what are what are the rules about gay bashing you're either it's either okay or it's not okay but Democrats say it's okay when they do it but not when we do\nAnyway they that Jimmy Kimmel wasn't even the only one of the late night guys Bill Maher\nJokes that Lindsey Graham needed stabilize the stabilizing influence of his dead boyfriend bought like whoa you just took that to a dark place even even CNN hosts like Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo got in on it on friday they mark Lindsey Graham\nFor having the vapors said first he's got the vapors\nDon Lemon was doing a southern accent he was mocking him referring to a job or women who are said to have the vapors if they were acting hysterical are rational so you're not\nJust making fun of gay people they're making fun of people from the south ... test test Don Lemon but here's the difference between them and us we can take a joke\nOkay I don't even care I'm only pointing this out because of their hypocrisy doesn't bother me go ahead make gay jokes make all the jokes you want but stopped getting so offended when some when some non political comedian makes a joke\nWhen Dave Chappelle made jokes about transgendered people on his Netflix special last year and transgender people demanded he apologized in net net flicks takes down that comedy special and they weren't high ranking members of the Democratic party who agreed with them\nI Wonder how many of those people are going to go after Rosie O'Donnell in Jimmy Kimmel and Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo Bill Maher for doing the same thing I'm gross or you know one of them I don't think any of them are it's weird\nFrom the Kavanaugh hearings who who's turned out to be who I've turned who I've ended up cheering for I never would have thought I'd be defending are cheering on Lindsey\nGraham but guys done a pretty good job you got ahead give credit where it's do you know what I'm saying the guy to respect the game game

trying to create a massive\nBusiness that is number one in the industry two thousand seven hundred sixty two year the sixteen properties or two hundred and thirty five million dollars with the net value\nAnd a man unbelievable accomplices robbers would go to the break you got cut off I think you were trying to explain to people with different where you were explaining to people the difference between marketing and sales my life I started I was a salesperson health clubs\nAre so all we ever did was praying higher and train salespeople\nAnd so you you see that you came out of the seals background you were professional sales person too good at hiring a train those people on the ground to make the sale\nBut how does it come to you that somewhere along the line you have to have a marketing department\nReady to rich which we felt that marketing a yeah L Z or that you said you know you you would would sell a product you get your team train to ... to sell that product and ask questions and suggestions pales in open ended and you know try to find out the features and benefits and convert that\nBut marketing is the act of driving people into your door\nYou know to me marketing as many of my colleagues was\nDoing a great renovation on the outside using nights color it's putting the new eight fees and changing up from you know Peter for taking the hardy board and making a clean because you're relying on a drive by marketing with a drive by marketing only gonna gonna you gonna bring in a certain price point I've read some people are willing to pay\nSix hundred seven hundred eight hundred dollars a month for rent as you jumping rent\nYou got to that that was aren't the people that are going to be driving by you got to bring these people went and I think that classy property that but I didn't understand that I needed a better marketing team I Need to understand how to drive in people and so\nAnd also as as we're owning or being the properties right I mean where are they experienced tremendous rank rope right probably more so than the\nGrowth of our residents right so what we might see some turnover we're still puts your rent units I used to be for you know seven hundred and fifty dollars or for nine hundred nine fifty well that's not the same rhetoric class you're going to have to bring in that that more ah\nThat that rhetoric has more discretionary income to be able to afford it so how where do you find them you gotta use marketing and these marketing marketing team that I basically took over from one from a ten thousand unit portfolio to my twenty five hundred unit at the time portfolio you know ... I I don't have the right tools\nAnd if you've got to the bell up a different a different set of tools that we had to ... to our website\nUm I consider is now a up a U.S fails and media company versus just a property management company\nSells is very important but so is the media the promotion of your business as well to our website now have acted video\nVideos very key we have videos of a resident of and videos of of our of our men and he's like a one probably got the party that you can come visit they have a great video on our website of a dog park why wall because I have that probably eighty percent one bit\nSixty percent of all of all singles in people that live in a one bad on I'm On a um have a pet\nAnd so you got to be pet friendly so the very first thing we're trying to do is attract that were kept plenty so that video is a dog park right but there's the analytics behind it like where did they come how do they find your website\nAnd again this is all new to me to his walks are hoping I'm that primary doing a great are expanding it but you've got to put keywords dinner because as are searching on the Web\nRight there typing in key words and that key words will bring them back to your website if you have a word in their additional either do it a lot of like Facebook promotion or Facebook Live a a feed\nA Google likes that they like to promote things that are active not just bail and so this team commit to me and they explained to me all these different concepts are like wow and say look we will double triple your eat\nThe kind of leads are getting in a two or three month period I'm started ... you know I'm Sorry that you're getting for all year we can do that in the two or three month period it would be just trust the process\nThat that that's what we're doing I think the class say\nExplain to us that there was another level\nOf operation that we needed to get you as a result we'd be able to bring that down to where it being the portfolio the property that you visited I mean what did you see you saw a giant TV with videos reading in the background or our Hurricane Harvey efforts where we helped out at church and bread creek are turtle our breast cancer walk\nA video of art that we did have fun video for me to celebrate our maintenance man another video or a Harvard or different and maybe and then you saw that that virtual three four five and where they could put on the little Google Goggles and pretend like they're they're in in you know\nIn the actual model\nSo that in case they're not their their decision maker who or their significant other is in with them during the during the tour they could go home they could use as little cardboard box that we gave them access to Google Goggles they put their phone and they're download the app and now they can or at home without having to be in your in your property these are things that were only a dream\nYou know where do you mean they were not even a dream I mean I don't even know we have the ... when we were doing\nYou know ... when we bought that property and fourteen today\nA it's a very different situation I'm really excited when I bring that expertise into the company which makes us better because now that we've crossed is hurdle now we're ready to cross the next fertile and so you ask me already what drives me in the morning I think it's that deal I think it's it's it's the it's the challenge of discovering new things\nAnd you had your mistake poetry and they're ... they're not mistakes were just learning lesson and you make her company stronger or ...

but you're part of the show too and if you want to get in on this\nDon't be shy of ... on the more I got tested\nTest result came back negative which at first I thought it was bad and then the doctor explain that means you don't have ... and I was like well that's a relief so if you want to call the show seven when three two one two five nine five oh you won't contract anything from doing it and I and ... and by the way you know it's just it's a libertarian safe space\nSurvey of free speech area you can always you can get away with a lot here there's only like seven words you can't say on my show\nAnd basically that's just because the government will charge me two hundred thousand dollars if you say that I mean isn't that unfair that's not fair fair is it it's really not unfair hey so the latest on this if you're just tuning in we've been talking about this thing with Ted Cruz\nAnd we were asking the question okay so somebody takes white powdery substance and they mail it to Ted Cruz's office right\nAnd they called the hazmat crew in and they bring in\nA fire department and they rushed people off to the hospital because they ask themselves what would be the motivation there well I don't know about the rest of you but white powdery substance is don't just mysteriously appear in empty ... that's not the kind of thing that happens typically\nPeople mail us stuff here at the radio station sometimes mostly it's mostly letters from people in prison you know because they can email us somebody you think I'm kidding but I'm definitely not no we do get mail from people in prison we got two letters today and they were charming it's amazing the great penmanship but some of the people in our\nIn our prison system but anyway um what was I saying oh yeah so we get these letters and and there's no white powdery substance is in our in our mail and when I go check my mail\nOutside my house there's nothing there so what's the point what's the point of doing this when they want to scare\nSomebody that works downtown and Ted Cruz's office I'm just getting everybody up to speed here now the latest on this and boy this is a really weird that this happened at the same day authorities at the Pentagon found at least two I'm not talking about one but I'm Talking about two packages suspected of can't containing rice and\nUm with this news coming just right after a scare Ted Cruz's office in Houston involving a white powdery substance is to turn out not to be hazardous ...\nA Pentagon spokesperson um who has been apparently been briefed by us defense secretary James Mattis mad dog Mattis [laughter] if you have to bart did you know you have to bark when you say his name yeah that's the rule I don't want him that's another FCC law I don't want to get us find like I'll play by the rules\nWhere was I owe us defense secretary James Mattis uh and then in the navy stop officer admiral John Richardson um that through the letters to the packages were addressed to\nAre believed to be containing rice and that is possible that this was another prank oh hilarious these huge comedy\nHa ha we made you not want to do your job today gotcha gotcha\nWell who do you think that makes look bad people on our side or people on their side people on grassroots activist on on Twitter earlier this week after you know they're in the past week there when Ted Cruz and his wife\nWere chased out of a restaurant were bragging about that on social media like hey nobody does this debate O'Rourke\nYeah there's a reason nobody does that debate or work because the people on our side behave themselves and we generally try to leave each other Republican when we when we're off work and him and that by the way is the gist of our ideology leave me alone\nReally they're they're really should just be too laws don't murder or hurt people and don't steal their stuff or respect their property those are really the only two laws that matter to me what about the rest of you I mean when you break it down at the end of the day\nI I only care about two things don't murder me don't write my wife don't break into my house and it's three things but you get the idea right like that's that's that should be the main law in America the second law in America and the third thing\nFor them it's it's hey don't use the wrong gender pronouns or you'll get fined a hundred thousand dollars in New York City you think that's an exaggeration that's something the progressive was actually wanted there's a new ridiculous law in California this this blows my mind like Abraham Lincoln style these people seem to think uh in California\nBut the law that we need is a law that says no corporation can have an all male board\nYou know what I'm saying right now you're cheap officers you got your\nYour see a cheap operational officer a chief financial officer so they're law is All right no women are no women equals illegal and you get fined okay but so so imagine what that means let's say there's three guys and they just graduated from I don't know UCLA Stanford some west coast university\nAnd the two of them said hey you know what would be great\nUh I have a great idea for a smartphone app while we don't have any money so we can't pay anybody that's okay you're an accounting major I'm a business major in our in our third friend here he's a computer software major why don't why don't the three of us just start the business ourself all worked for free maybe we'll work part time at night delivering pizzas and will be I\nI Know a little bit of ... about what we could apply and be an El Al see like a limited liability corporation\nIf you did that in California you broke the law that's unbelievable it's absolutely baffling as I mentioned\nThat a few minutes ago that there should be other laws now that there should only be three lost some of you came up with some great laws in the comments section where am I right now in Facebook Live I should explain that to people listening in the car right now are on terrestrial radio and I\nHave to I have to address these I'm Sandy has a great suggestion here she says ... don't hurt my kids are my dog\nAbsolutely but I can I kinda think that all falls into the first law don't hurt or murder anybody so yeah dogs and horses for sure and dogs and horses that kind of falls into the second law to respect people's property right so but absolutely all great stuff\nUm let's see fifth law leave me alone yeah that's the whole ideology that's what it\nReally means to be a liberty minded conservative or a a conservative libertarian or whatever the heck you are we're getting calls and I want to take 'em so I'll give us a ring seven when three two one two five nine five zero to ... the\nFirst call Hey Daniel are you calling from Pennsylvania\nWhich part\nOf a bird is one of the car between a bite out the panhandle in a president\nJane yeah sure yeah yeah yeah that's where I'm at\nJust just wish me that is how how far are you from Scranton and that's how I figure everything out in Pennsylvania\nA bottom about six hours in in ... or ah last Tuesday\nTo go get a job did you go there to buy papers

you call about\nThe the the ... ... and the the ah in ah the Pentagon I mean this is just a bunch of boat it\nYeah I mean [noise] like\nGetting me it's like\nWhen it's for getting shot\n[noise] interesting yeah interesting analogy right and so for those that don't get the reference he's talking about how World War one started France or some people think Franz Ferdinand is just an alternative rock band but it turned out they named a a European political leader after after the\nBand ... did you know that no it happened to me ... I was I was messing with my producer cruises an old enough to even know that Franz Ferdinand is an alternative route [laughter] [laughter] right right right that's correct yeah he was he was from I mean are they\nI mean they they ... and white to me", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "02"}
