Republican there are just Democrats in disguise and that that was rife\nAmong the right and it looked like they were never going to be able to get on the same page but now they won the Republican

story this poor guy went to\nThis rally to protest\nRight wing extremism or something like white supremacist nonsense some freaking knuckle dragging you will not replace us more on getting together I think it was in Portland and he showed up\nStaunch Democrat Bernie supporter\nWith his American flag and to him the American flag was a symbol of unity and hope\nAnd in some ways he was sort of taken aback I suppose felt as though the American flag and been appropriated by people that were hateful and wanted to make sure that people knew that folks on the left we're proud to be American as well what a novel\nConcept there were some antifa protesters there doing what they do demanded his flag he was like what no you can't have my ... my ... my and I'm not going to get that ... people eating snot out of this guy took his flag and left them bleeding on the ground\nThe antifa folks beat the crap out of a Bernie Sanders supporter because he wasn't lefty enough\n\nMaybe maybe it does go hand in hand with last maybe the division goes hand in hand with loss when Obama was president the right we're blaming each other because they lost again two terms in a row uh jeeze\nMust be your fault must be your fault oh wait are guy one where we can all get along again\nAnd I guess that would logically dictate that people on the left\nWhen they lost well they would start looking around for people to blame I mean there's tremendous division still between Bernie Sanders supporters and Hillary Clinton supporters and there's so many Bernie boosters that will tell you that Bernie Sanders would be president if Hillary Clinton was in such a dirty\nCheating scoundrel and all the sort of stuff I think there's still plenty of that to go around I guess is the last that brings the division I don't know I Do notice though is tremendously disappointing time where we are so divided not just among ourselves left and right don't win\nBut when people within their own parties can't get on the same page\nIt's sad because ultimately we're on the same side and the seeds of division that exist between us whether it's between left and right or left\nNot left it up for re not write

he had some misdemeanors and I I empathize with that because\nYou know if you're misdemeanors that means you did something that really is only vaguely bad and it shouldn't haunt you for the rest of your life and he was talking about doing background checks on him and his employer and and then John Hung up before we had to go to break it wasn't you know what happens commercials happened but

that is one of the problems with misdemeanors and a permanent record of course people always opted forget this you can get your record expunged although I'm told in\nTaxes that this is one of the fifty states where it's the most difficult to do that have you heard the word that yea yea which\nYou know we were in it but worth the effort\nBy that might have tried to do that but they couldn't do it so\nOh we we have Donald I'm just been told by my producer that we have wings over Houston tickets we could give away I forgot all about that I'm Chris I'm so glad you reminded me Donald do you want to go to wings over Houston\n[noise] sure you're going to you know what it is it's an air show did you know that's how many tickets and we have to give away can maybe three\nFour we have for pears okay so let's get one paranoid Donald you want to go you should we give Donald some tickets what do you see as Donald Donald you're going to wings\nOver Houston makes you for calling and make you think you were telling us that I agree with what you're saying it's frustrating the system isn't perfect but so far it's the best system we've got a in the meantime we been talking about Kanye West at CNN CNN says\nThe county West is a minstrel show for those that don't know what that means it's a very racist thing to say about black people rave for Massachusetts what's on your mind you're the you're the law student right yep what's\nRight and I'm Sorry just watching the black man it's like OK CNN\nCNN yelling at a black man for not falling in line not surprised Democrats are always wanna you know want to get the black men down\nSure yeah there's a lot of truth to that there really is and you know we were talking about this earlier what Kanye West might not be the best spokesperson for this cause but what he's saying is true\nYeah he I mean isn't that amazing I think that is amazing when you look at it just back in ten years ago what you believe any of that ...\nTo oh no no no no no no I wasn't sure whether he meant permitted to win that Donald Trump and Kanye West\nWould be the spokesperson for the for the for the conservative Republican movement and the Taylor Swift would be a critic from the Democratic party [noise] no I never saw any of that coming [noise]\nYeah I guess I'm just not that it's all happening probably why and if you're trying to get back and yeah right you know\nRight I think you're I think you're right about that because CNN used to get used to get a lot of uh uh uh they used they used to score points out the fact that Kanye West because one of them you remember George W. Bush doesn't like black people you remember when he said that right oh\nI Can't forget that spot on the part that they are and I remember\nRight doesn't care about black people and that's the kind of you want to see what they want now let's be real he was just crazy then as he is now it's all the crazy he admits he's crazy he's bipolar he's outspoken about it he's not ashamed of the fact that he's crazy but at the same time just because he's crazy doesn't mean he's wrong about that\nWell that sounds great if people are sometimes in less than it does that make things that\nI've always said the economy is he's a genius music producer I said this before you joined our side he's a genius music producer he's a pretty good rapper [noise] he's a bad singer and he's probably the worst fashion designer on earth\nNot denying that you see you get a man how's school going up there right how's Massachusetts street near\nUm something coming up so does that take a break and we're not going to show\nYeah how's the study and going on I was a girl situation up there\nBut thank God God I got to focus on work yeah heart I had a\nLittle too much money to God I mean I'm right after I got to just talk about works\nYou know what ... what would your Twenty years old is that right yeah okay like you have your whole life don't worry about it don't even worry about trying to settle down until you're thirty take your time do you have ten ten years you have one thing that none of us have and that's and that's you have a lot of time take advantage of that goes slow\nBelieve me life at this point is is everything is exciting\nYou're going to some woman's gonna throw herself at you and and you're going to have a moment of doubt where maybe\nMaybe you'll given the last maybe you won't know and it's okay to have a good time but at the same time just remember there's going to be plenty of these opportunities\nFor any much yeah you get it the man hey get back to Texas too soon brother we appreciate you is there anything else you wanted to say\nThat that just\nHope everything anything on the right\nMan it's ... I I I Am refreshed by the fact that there's somebody like you in Massachusetts and I and I hope that there's more people like you up there [noise] All right yeah man call anytime ray we appreciate you dude that was re up in Massachusetts I think he's from here but he's a law student\nYeah there you know and and I'm I I enjoy hearing about his progress up there in in Massachusetts you know he's a young man and the road in front of him is longer than the red behind\nBoy you could say that again that is so true and and sometimes\n\nIn Maine\nTorturing waterboarding is not illegal or condone active this person of evil nor any other person you get at least have a happy and safe Halloween do you\nOwe the crypt keepers salty about bad he didn't like it ... they cancelled the show and he's having a bad Halloween what are you going as\nWell um I'm not quite sure yet well my wife and I didn't want to offend anybody so I decided to dress as a Native American and Morgan is going to go as I Know some other marginalized group that you're not supposed to address how sexy\nOh but ... the kitty or or well that's no you can't do that anymore I found it gets offended by now how 'bout how 'bout I go a sexy Robert De Niro Robert Deniro I only say that is a terrible thing you'd have to cut your legs off about seven or eight inches\nThat's true that's fair he um I short little ... and that is true I only bring up Robert Deniro to say this first of all ... has campaigned and raised a ridiculous amount of money at thirty eight million three million dollars now it is highly likely that Iraq has raised more than every Democrat nominee for the U.S Senate from Texas\nSince at least Nineteen Seventy eight combined mhm they're saying that the it goes back to Nineteen eighty two but campaign finance records from before Nineteen eighty two are generally not available on FCC's website I'm at agency only goes back to Nineteen Seventy five so it is possible that Beto O'Rourke\nIs the biggest Senate campaign candidate of all time for Democrats I mean it's possible it's possible yeah we don't really know it it certainly looks that way this is record breaking amounts of stuff so\nWhere do you think all that money came from um I don't think it came from Texas more than half of it came from outside of Texas right according to\nAccording to the ... open secret summer learning to yeah exactly it's something like sixty eight percent I mean more than half which should bother people and I I Would be curious to see where that money comes from I Would be willing to bet top three like this California New York Illinois you\nKnow what I Would I Would say maybe not Illinois but why don't tend to be the people in Chicago D.C for sure yeah definitely ... Chicago probably number four then yeah 'cause people in Chicago I spend a lot of money on politics and other states and they say do it because they're in in Illinois and the Democrats win every ... yeah exactly okay something\nThey'll have a Republican governor just to like keep things interesting\nThey have one right now and he is very moderate he's not far to the right at all and they can't get anything done in that state well good\nYou know the the less they get done the less taxation the average citizen has to\nOffer you just reminded me of something I I heard an interesting thing recently Janine with taxation is staff tax stopped\nAbsolutely true anyway I get very angry about taxation taxation is slapped tariffs our taxes so those are the captain socialism is an entire system designed around taxation which has stopped which means socialism is what ... socialism is\nFast and it's death and I would say extortion but yeah any of those answers correct ding ding ding winner winner chicken dinner which is now in offensive term to use that because it because it's um non inclusive to people who were beaten oh\nYeah I Know I Know they're very mad about there's there's a lot that we you know part of what's interesting about the social justice warriors and the PC culture is we actually have Australia to blame for a lot of this oh yeah in Australia this is very normal here in America we're still not sure I don't know what about in\nAustralia and there's a movement now to ask the babies can send you\n\nA good example of what I'm Talking about I almost forgot about that yeah there's a thing in Australia they they actually had a PSA they were circulating on line and some of us here in America got wind of this and we thought oh this must\nBe that these ads are news not satire\nNo it's really not satire if I change your nappy in the meantime Robert De Niro who probably is one of the people it's thrown a lot of money a ... or work I'd be willing to bet she thinks that Beto O'Rourke should run for\nPresident in twenty twenty you which I think is what a lot of us just assumed that he was trying to do yeah here in Texas because he certainly can't be running for Senate in ... these are his ridiculous policy positions\nRight I mean and what's really funny is that with all the money that is being thrown at ... and his way or his\nPoll numbers um just are not reflecting the effort\nTo know right now it looks like Ted Cruz for for for for what is considered to be I think it was the Texas Tribune\nThese these posters always lean to the left and may have Ted Cruz ahead by nine right now so what do you think the real number as I Would bet it's twice that\nI'd say it's probably fourteen fifth\nYeah I Would I Would think Eighteen but yeah you're right I think you're being fair it's definitely more than nine and here's part of the reason why that is true first of all these posters it always leads to the left but but part of the reason why it always leads to the left is they just don't talk to people like us have you ever been contacted by a pollster\nOr the last time I was contacted by a poster I think it was twenty pounds\nI'm impressed that they contacted you at all 'cause it's never happened to me it didn't happen to me when I Lived in Illinois and it's never happened to me in Texas right and it and the polls are always wrong to St pollsters who think Ted Cruz's ahead by nine told us Hillary would win by a wide margin\nThat's right yes they told her told us that she had a Ninety three percent chance of winning\nYeah absolutely just silly silly what a bunch of selling on Sunday hey speaking of silly and living in a Hollywood um have you heard about what Arnold Schwarzenegger did\nDid he finally apologize for being himself\nKind of hard work to Nader used to be\nYoung people don't believe me when I tell them is but Arnold Schwarzenegger used to be cool no it's true it's true yeah Arnold Schwarzenegger used to be cool I thought people were supposed to move farther to the right when they got older white but Arnold did the opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger used to joke that only girlie Matt Good morning again early men girly man\nOpposed energetic capitalism and traditional American values but now\nThe former California Governor is apologizing for popular rising to phrase\nYes yes he's in the I think he also

nineties it was like why\nWhat was another thing that they use and we're not going to remember all stupid catch phrases from the Chinese anyway Arnold Schwarzenegger not only does he feel bad about that but in a recent interview he admitted that he stepped over the line several times were sweating [laughter] to the exact\nQuote I Wonder have you on the line is when he's having an affair with a

called Democrats supporters a mob their mom don't describe don't do the mob thing they're not a mob there just peaceful protesters\nFunny thing about that they are mobs and there are a huge problem right now this isn't hyperbole true in fact cure some soundbites of people telling conservatives to stop describing leftist activist as mobs\nFollowed by soundbites of angry leftist mobs that have

us talking about how he he likes Trump's Trump's had makes them feel like Superman you didn't have a strong role models growing up and he liked that male energy he was attacked with us they mock them on MSNBC and CNN they call them the house and word\nThings that the Trump communist summit weren't as crazy as everyone makes it out to be though county talked about his feelings on the third for Thirteen ... amendment the thirteenth amendment\nIs the part of the constitution that abolished slavery one at least it's it's supposed to here's county where I was just being Kanye West this yeah he's crazy but he's county west a lot\nThat ...\nAnd I didn't say that all the while he's around the track or\nHave you on the floor to see the face of our history of\nWould you feel\nYou know how you can fall into a bar and you got\nAll that\nShit before they do not have voted for 'em\nAnd I think the way the universe perfect\nParents so this news stories hard to miss cable TV talking heads can't stop talking about this wild read from Tanya performed in front of news cameras and the president the liberal media as enjoyed attacking Kanye West first political stance more specifically for criticizing the thirteenth amendment\nTo thirty them I missed part of the constitution and it addresses slavery right up just explain that you get that back abusing we all understand that right\nIt's supposed to abolish the heinous crime of forced labor but that's not really what it does and county understands this even if he lacks the ability to explain it clearly county wants us to change or get rid of the thirteenth amendment\nAnd the liberal media has vilified him for his stance but he's actually a hundred percent right you see there's a clause in the thirteenth amendment that actually allows slavery\nThe leftist known this for years USA Today even published an op ed about it in twenty fourteen when Obama was still produce and liberals thought that this was a genius point read this listen to this this is from the u._s._a. today Tony fourteen\nRatified at the end of the civil war the amendment abolishing slavery with one critical exception slavery and involuntary ... servitude actually remains lawful as a punishment for a crime were of the party Shelby duly convicted in other words according to the so called punishment clause if you get pulled over with the wrong controlled substance in your trunk\nThere is nothing in the thirteenth amendment to insure you can't be considered a slave at the state\nThe punishment clause was taken directly from the northwest ordinance Seventeen eighty seven and reflected the belief of the time that hard work was the central to prisoners moral rehabilitation with the language has also been big us enough to be grossly abused soon the cause was being used to reinstate slavery under another guise\nThe twenty four that's that's where the quote ends for an article in that USA Today op ed was celebrated by liberal Democrats after it was published today those same Democrats are mocking Kanye West for attempting to make similar points\nHere's a little history lesson for you folks the civil war ended in Eighteen sixty five a year later in Eighteen sixty six a black man was arrested for theft in Maryland you guys all know about this\nA local newspaper at the time published an adverse stating that the man was available for purchase as a slave because he committed a crime and needed to be punished\nPunishment was slavery how could this be slavery was abolished by the Emancipation Proclamation of Eighteen sixty three\nBut slaves in Maryland We're emancipated as separate action when the state of Maryland voted on a new constitution at the state level in Eighteen sixty four\nSo two years later how could a local newspaper advertising the sale of a slave\nSimply put the punishment causing the thirteenth amendment allowed them to do so of course Frederick Frederick Douglass show him he's ... he's a very famous American abolitionist he criticized the convict lease system it's a policy that exploited the punishment clause of the thirteenth amendment\nDouglas believed a large number of black men were placed behind bars because the system was trying to exploit them\nDouglas disliked how convicts released out to railway and mining companies were large plantations companies essentially purchased the convicts from the state and exploited them for cheap labor\nFortunately the twentieth century brought us a handful of Supreme Court rulings that somewhat sought to stop these activities from taking place but a lot of what Douglass was critical about still rings true today\nPina labor form of slavery or involuntary servitude is explicitly allowed by the thirteenth amendment of the constitution increases in prison
