closet smoker so I was always hiding or trying to find a place to do when somebody now me afterwards it really sort of controlled my entire down\nI switched to a June because my boss recommended\nWelcome back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One for bombs and looking\nBack last segment Adele ... radio show earlier today\nI was discussing the fact that real estate investing is like watching a trained come down the tracks you can see it come and but you can get out of the way well here's an article that tells you that it's time to start paying attention to the train coming down the tracks and it's an article says the feds\nOr duly more than four interest rate hikes unlikely this year a dual use one is the New York representative of the Federal Reserve\nAnd he says hey we've had one rate increase quarter of a point\nBut we're anticipating three to four and more this year\nSo that means interest rates when we were blocking her apartment to the three point eight five a couple of years ago now we're up in the four point five interest rate we could end up at five point five now why do I tell you this\nBecause a bum you know because you need to start thinking about OK any interest rate changes I'm going to make in the future if I'm going to refinance or anything I'm going to have to\nFactor into the act and interest rates are going to be higher now they're telling me a year in advance that they're going to do this right\nSo should not be smart enough to understand that they're telling us this in advance so we can prepare for it so that we don't make bad investments decisions based on the lower interest rates we have today to higher interest rates were going to happen next year I mean I'm watching the interest rate every single day\nFor many reasons one also that would be able to consult people's or what is it a realistic interest rate to look at for underwriting project but also for all the funds that I Am sitting around everywhere you know probably twenty or thirty accounts I own\nUm different bank accounts and I'm looking at what those interest rates are doing it where the rat and it it really makes a major difference I mean do you think about\nYou know if you got ten million dollars or twenty million dollars or you're talking about a five percent interest rate if it gets back up to that is a million bucks a year when we repeat that if you get twenty million bucks five percent interest rate is a million dollars a year\nThat's a lot of money so you know you're looking at the positive side of the interest rates go up all of us with money are making more money as interest rates go up\nA ... the people that are buying real estate only need to factor that those interest rates are going to be higher and at some point the sellers of real estate are going to have to be realistic remember what I said earlier\nThe only reason you can't sell piece of real estate overnight is because you're not selling it for the appraised price you're trying to sell for more than it appraises for and then hope that they can squeeze the appraisal in and get it done bottom line is\nWhen interest rates get up higher and higher and higher the sellers you're going to have to come off those aggressive sales prices is that could hurt us no we're going to be buying it a little bit lower price paying a little bit higher interest rate net net net it's got to be the same thing it's a business we've got to be money we don't make money we don't get into the business\nRight now the only people that have to watch out or people that went into these deals are this year\nAnd thinking they're going to refinance next year but not anticipating an interest rate changed for next year guys if you're buying a property right now and you're in a bridge loan\nOr your hard money alone you need to think about how quickly can I get out of these loans so that I don't feel the effects of three more interest rate hikes\nThis was a time issue the train is coming down the tracks guys there it is we see it or telling you it's there there's no reason to panic\nThe logical thinking through what changes do I need to make my portfolio in the next six months to avoid any type of interest rate risk that's what you need to be thinking about that will make it all happen All right\nLast article of the day I dug this without just to prove a point that has nothing to do with the article but it was a good segue into our thought process and that was this was from the greater Schuster partnership but they're talking about what are the fastest growing employment markets now\nThe reason that's important to real estate investing is wherever there's more important for every five jobs there's another rental you rented for every five jobs there's another rental unit rented this the ratio they go by so the more\nNew employment coming into your child\nRight the higher your rents are going to be and the higher your occupancy is going to be so get this right here right out of the blocks Dallas Fort Worth a hundred and forty six thousand\nNew people hundred and forty six thousand coming in Houston Ninety four thousand four hundred and Seventeen net group\nAtlanta ... nine thousand six eighty eight thousand and it goes down the list but here's where it gets interesting guys the liberal states are starting to lose people\nWhy well because those governments are feeling they're going broke and their taxes are getting higher and higher and higher their cost of living is getting higher and higher and people are fed up with it and they had net negative\nEmployment growth people are moving away\nRather play the growth but net negative\nPopulation growth okay so think about somebody like Chicago Chicago is losing Thirteen thousand people this year that's tax base property tax base that sales tax base that they're losing that's personal income state income tax base they're losing now\nFor the rest of you out there that haven't figured this out I took a bunch of just get your head in the sand if you live in one of these liberal states like California\nWhat's gonna happen to you this years your taxes are going to go up by twenty five to thirty percent because you have a twelve percent state income tax rate\nThat and you have high property taxes because your property they're so expensive the rates low but these properties are expensive so you have taxes you used to be able to write all that off the gift your federal income tax returns you no longer can folks\nThat means you're actually for the first time going to pay the taxes that you have been taxed by the government in other words the giant money steal\nThat state governments have been stealing from the federal government making all of us people in the rest of the country paper you guys to live it's over\nYou're going to pay to live like liberal whacked two knees and you're going to couldn't throwing out money to always welfare programs all these super super duper giveaways and you're going to go broke\nBut they're smart people that live where you're at they will they're going to come live with us they're going to come live in a rational society where people no longer try to live off of other people\nThink that went through but remember it's not the money it's a lifestyle seat about\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nRadio show memory can obtain there was no you can't get enough to go on the dot com boom was you know we really enjoyed the conversation

you can't vote on the south Carolina senatorial race if you live in Michigan or Virginia\nOr Florida or California although people in California Boy are they they're so interested in what happens in other people's states aren't they they just\nThey can't shake it they can't they can't stop worrying about your life and your business and trying to poke a little rotted taxes to tell us what to do here in the Lone Star state well that's why I'm grateful that Mike Pence is actually in Texas today he's going up to Dallas to do a little campaign for a buddy Ted Cruz up there and you know\nDoesn't hurt it's nice to get a little push I'm sure that Ted appreciates it in the meantime this\nIs what this really means what Kavanaugh getting on to the Supreme Court really means for you and you and me\nAnd that guy over there and her in the back and him in the rear no pun intended is that uh apparently what this really means is that now that Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court we all need to start worrying about midterms so that's where everybody's turning their attention now and ... and and not to be done Spartacus\nWent there as well oh Spartacus Spartacus by Spartacus\nCory Booker he went to Iowa over the weekend to give a speech to the Iowa Democrats nothing really that interesting happened there the real news is that he went in the first place why would Cory Booker be interested in traveling to New Jersey well I think we know why he wants to run for president and and he will Cory Booker will absolutely be one of the uh but he will he will actually\nBe one of the ... the candidates for the nomination for the DNC and and that that the influence of Kavanaugh getting on the Supreme Court\nHas made a tremendous effect on the Democrats because now now some of them want senator her own odor to run for president well she never had a prayer saying it's before she suddenly it was just lucky enough to be on the Senate Judiciary committee in time for one of the most contested\nJudicial nominations in history anyway I'm just getting warmed up we just got on the air this pursuit of happiness radio pursuit of happiness radio is not my show it's not Ken Webster

furious there's this video of them pounding on the doors of the Supreme Court on\nSunday and what what has if someone's going to come answered the door for them and why would they do if that did happen what if some guy came in open the door it was a janitor and he's like hey who's knocking on the door at your what did they get a new storm the Supreme Court and beat up the janitor I mean it's so silly the temper tantrum they're just\nOut there screaming ... eyes out and scream in their mouth and screaming their lungs and you know many other workers they that they could scream out of that's what they're doing\nIn the meantime what they need to do now is take the energy from the outrage over Kavanaugh in fire up the base they got to get people fired up for the next thing well what is the next big thing you know the left has a little bit of trouble with branding lately they're not exactly appealing to the masses with their uh\n... with their with their hot button issues of the day and they're not\nI think you'll know what I'm Talking about most people\nIn this day and age don't want more government healthcare we don't want more gun control\nThe things that the Democrats are really touting out to their constituency isn't necessarily stopped but those of us here in the fly over states care about half you know believe me I mean just imagine what's happening outside the Supreme Court right now is a group of angry grassroots activists gather together and outrage [noise]\nI don't even know what her name is does anybody you know and I don't\nEven think she knows her own and no one knows her name no one as they include her name is but she accused a Brett Kavanaugh of taking out is junk and waving it in her face at a party I think we all know what I mean by John ... his ... his man that's right and we'll just leave it at that plagues and berries right we'll leave it at that\nTime just as a family show of course it's a family show you get it Chris gets it we've got to keep it clean keeping PG around here we are trying to get rid of a young audience it's a lot of children that much like the Alex Jones show this is a family friendly program doesn't that make you laugh when he calls his family friendly show I'm Sorry if I was just a family\nFinally show who what family is watching Alex job what [laughter] I mean no in fact I just don't think it is anyway where was I I kinda lost my train of thought there\nSo so Republicans and Democrats alike are now blaming Michael ... and I don't know if it's the fair I don't know if that's fair but one thing is for sure\nBrett Kavanaugh is going to happen no matter what just get over edit the Republicans won the election they had more than enough votes in is not to mention they had my parents you probably saw that that that bolt of lightning shoot through the sky on friday and it was Mike Pence\nHeading to Washington DC to confirm his vote for Brett Kavanaugh will turn out I don't think we've needed it we are Joe Manchin he's a Democrat common way and and I mean that was enough it didn't matter after that yeah Jeff like Jeff Flake by the way let's never forget Jeff Flake will never run for office again so it probably won't matter but don't ever forget\nThat Jeff Flake who called for the FBI investigation was doing it because a bunch of ... a fan of Nazis\nAccosted him on an elevator and it turned out they were just a bunch of paid activists funded by George Charles Jeff Flake got fault I'm Ken Webster junior did you know it's Columbus Day technically Columbus Day It's Wednesday I think but today we honor ads\nAnd the left wants you to believe that you shouldn't while I'm here to tell you that you can you can probably celebrate Columbus Day because he's made some great contributions to
