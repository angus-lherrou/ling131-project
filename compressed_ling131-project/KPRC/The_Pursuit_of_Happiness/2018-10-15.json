I'm just and you do that the prices of this realistic compared to the prices in the past is so large\nThe curb is still there are guys but it looks sweat on the surface\nAnd it's just not going to get there very quickly and by the way we don't fall off a bird even though it's around\nAnd I don't think you're going to follow up real estate investment even though you're sitting on a curve this was an opportunity right now to really kill it I Hope you'll see that\n... has been beneficial hoping usually that now before we go I Want to remind you\nThat I Will be a location this year over the country I Want you to go to this website ... ... ... ... del dot com\nYou go there you'll see all the locations I'm going to be up to do so I'm going to be there and I want to be in your area sometime this year we're going over the country or would you go their website pick out I mean what do you want to go to register yourself to come see me to meet me personally\nI always do not only little presentation but open conversation Ashville presentation where you sit and talk to me personally and asked me questions you asked me you're not going to want to miss this\nThese this opportunity is only going to occur in your city once each year because I Will be going all over the country but these are little small intimate things that you can get involved in\nAnd you're not going to want to Michelle to go to meet del dot com R.

hurricane Michael's destruction her makes the Brady functioning as President Trump taking an aerial tour of devastated communities in the Florida Panhandle calling the damage really incredible including massive trees just ripped out of the earth governor Rick Scott was at the airport to greet him when he arrived earlier today\nIt's a newspaper that spent years trying to protect Warren on this issue and and I was already had issued a correction on this piece for overstating warns Indian ancestry ancestry they broke the details of orange DNA test\nAnd and the analysis earlier today the articles author is Amy Lenski similarly ...\nProvided cover for Warren's passed in September with a story declaring or claimed to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard law faculty at every step of her remarkable rise in the legal profession [noise] the people responsible for hiring her saw her as a white\nWoman okay is that true Lenski admits Warren changed her ethnicity from white to Native American both at University of Pennsylvania law school where she taught from Nineteen eighty seven in Nineteen Ninety five and at Harvard law school where she had tenure starting in Nineteen Ninety five so this benefited her career\nIn academic assuming the DNA test is accurate Warren could still make no claimed to membership and the Cherokee tribe\nThe eastern span of Cherokee Indians as a minimum threshold of one sixteenth blood quantum\nAnd the United the Taliban's threshold is one quarter blood quantum I'm not a geneticist I won't pretend that I have done the or have done the test on this myself but here's what this really means let's say hypothetically any grain of is destroyed all which I don't think it is\nThat would mean that if she goes on line to DNA dot\nCom or ancestry dot com or what's the other one what's the other popular website Chris you never done one of these\n... okay ancestry dot com or one of the competitors you should be able to recreate the results of this stuff is a scientific than surely you should be able to go on to another website send\nThem your percentage of your bloodline or your urine test or whatever it is they do DNA test you know he's sending a spit swab or whatever it is and they send you back the results there should be we should be able to recreate the results of this if this is scientific\nIf it's real science real science that it can't be recreated now remember Trump challenged her on this back in July and and he's not the first people that the challenge dream around this for years years and years passed\nFor years we've wandered are really a Native American never proved it never bothered to even try she claimed she knew that she was Native American because people in her family have high cheekbones well what is that even mean it means nothing ... literally means\nNothing it's fake news folks the gloves rent paid a front page headline which Warren shared on social media to declare victory for herself reads Warren reveals test confirming ancestry but they don't actually point out that they haven't said for an ancestry I'm Ken Webster junior we are just getting warmed up a we

that's okay we don't need things we don't need a fast paced high speed Internet connection to give people information about what's going on in the world why would we need that\nIt doesn't matter where we are just happy to be here you know sometimes you just got to breathe to take a brac ... like attracts like that's what my wife always says it is possible that the Russians are messing with me right now\nI mean there's no other logical explanation for any of this or is it possible maybe it's possible that maybe it's\nPossible that Elizabeth Warren found out we were speaking hill of her on the radio and she has\nThe ghosts of some\nCherokee wore cheap haunting the ISD on line or possibly the tea it's not the end it's the one we're using a T one connection and there's no other explanation there must be a Cherokee wore cheap\nSent by Pocahontas to haunt the studio 'cause she knew I was going to come on the air and figuratively speaking rubber a new one\nBut I Can't because I I Can't even play audio right now here we go what's going on here this computer oh this is the best okay so anyway I'm Donald Trump there's two reasons why we're talking about Elizabeth Warren okay so if you're just tuning in in the last segment I've already explained that Elizabeth Warren took this DNA tested she was bragging about it she was so proud of herself\nBecause after all the DNA test proved\nThat Donald Trump was wrong about her that she really is a Native American and the DNA test doesn't really prove that she's Native American approves it she's Ninety five percent European American\nAnd in order to claim that your Native American you have to be at least twelve percent right\nShe was claiming what that she was Cherokee you know really is Cherokee I always love bringing the story up because this is unreal Texas heritage stuff Sam Houston no no no he wasn't genetically biologically\nCherokee Indian he was made an honorary member because he used\nDoes your show up at protests which shields and bats but this weekend they were out there the city of Portland was a mess this weekend\nSo the patriots prayer organized a march for law and order on Saturday law and order was nowhere to be seen by the way it was the point of the rally\nBecause if you've been following the news you know what's been going on in Portland lately it's been violence it's been out of control antifa built a wall in front of the local ice facility earlier this summer and since that's happened they a black guy got shot by cops while he was shooting it to other people who incidentally he hit\nSo antifa comes out and blocks off an intersection and started protesting every anti for a rally pretty much turns into a riot within minutes I I mean and that's an exaggeration but within hours sometimes minutes sometimes days doesn't antifa will get there they will turn every rally into a violent demonstration just give them the chance and they will do it\nAnd people pay not so surprising visit to this right wing rally this weekend and their spare spray and blunt objects and people being violently attacked\nEssentially 'cause they don't like that somebody else there doesn't share their political beliefs\nWhen you see the two videos when er there's multiple videos of this but when you see the video of the duo groups slowly approaching each other\nYou can tell they're about to start fighting there is a video of this up at Cape here see radio dot com if you want to take a look at it just got to the Ken Webster junior blog click the show blog ... drop down near the top of the screen click on my name Kendall after junior and you can usually find an article or a video for almost everything I talk about on the show there\nAnd riot police were called out to defuse the situation but that's not what happened they used pepper balls to combat the violence street fighters and the Portland girl claims the MTV extremist carry blast brass knuckles [laughter] and it got it got pretty dangerous pretty quickly a quick break has\nMe run the blank here ah give us a call seven on three to five nine five zero could this happen in Houston well it kind of has already and I'll tell you a little bit about that right after we get back at me a call let me know what's going on out there Houston how're you doing more pursuit of happiness radio coming up right after this [noise] you've got pursuit of happiness radio\nRadio [noise]\nGreetings hooks getting my junior year welcome to the show pursuit of happiness radio other phone line seven when three two one two five nine fifty it'd be like to make a comment on the show I Love when you do we are all we've been hacked by Russians\nToday we're having some issues for those that are wondering where is the live video feed we almost always have a live video feed of this radio shows people number on the air\nAnd streams out of her face but climbing we just don't happen today we're just couldn't get the couldn't get the equipment to work we got hacked by Russians and we could not get a connection before the show started we tried we try to hurt us we always try to do the best show for all of you and today we failed because Russians hacked into there's no other explanation\nWe we have our we have a people we have we have higher Robert Mueller to investigate this and figure out why the video feed will not work\nRobert Mueller is working feverishly James Comey is involved James Comey is you're right now isn't that right say hello James\nThat's weird how your voice is so high pitched James I don't know how their voice kind of like that so interesting anyway and other news you may have heard about this today weren't there are things happening besides our studio being hacked by Russians today I Know it's big news by a team of investigators entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier today\nFor what Turkish officials called a joint inspection of the building where Saudi journalist he's ... he's an American Jamal 'cause soggy disappeared nearly two weeks ago guy wrote for the Washington Post it's been claimed there was a report that he went into the consulate and he was murdered\nAnd reports on that very a bit I've seen some dark explanations\nOut there on the Internet for what happened to him um I won't even begin to try to figure it out but the team arrived by on marked police cars at the council it and said nothing to journalists waiting outside as they enter the building police Bush back the journalist from the front of the council that\nThey've been out there for days these people it's just like the protest to Kavanaugh these guys would standing out there for days they don't know what's going on everybody wants to know what's up\nAnd now they're supposed to be some joint investigation happening I'm skeptical at us the latest report on this that Saudi is going to admit to killing the journalists during interrogation so this was a new report from CNN\nBut remember this is CNN so kind of take that as a grain of salt\nI don't it's not that I don't believe that that's what would happen I totally believe that it's\nPossible that that is a very likely explanation but when CNN is the source point you've got to be skeptical about this I mean we all know we all know how often they are misleading on things like this\nThey had an interview with Donald Trump on sixty minutes over the weekend and they asked about this they almost kind of asked him about this as if they were blaming him\nI'm I'm not really sure that it's fair to blame Donald Trump for this but you know how the media will blame them for anything\nThe media will the media will blame Donald Trump for this missing journalist if they thought they could get away with it because you know why why not it's a it's a fun story for them it's fun for their viewers to believe that Donald Trump is somehow involved in this part of the reason why they're mad at my wife CBS would even suggest\nThis journalist missing in in ... in in Turkey that disappeared at the consulate there is somehow the fault of Donald Trump is because they think Donald Trump as a friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia it's almost like they've never seen those photos\nBrock Obama bowing down\nTo the king of Saudi Arabia Saudi crown prince anyway so here's Donald Trump on CBS on sixty minutes yesterday being asked about the missing journalist and I'm a computer ...\nMiles a shovel the journalist's journalist is was he murdered by the Saudis and did the prince ... the order to kill him\nWho nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated it's being looked at very very strongly that we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it and then that denied the mentally couldn't pay them yes\nChallenger son in law just got on the phone and asked the plans\nTo pay what it didn't and I think\nThey deny it they denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer what\nAre your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators proposed\nWhat depends on what the sanctions and give me an example they ordering military weapons\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanting it China wanted we wanted it we got it and we got all of it every bit of it so would you cut that are like well what I don't want to do going ... Raphael and all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that and you know there are other ways of a\nKind of how to use a word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\nHowever buddy what to do here you know\nWell there's a lot of sick there's a lot at stake and maybe especially so because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that there's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to see we're going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punishment\nAll right so what one of the things people are calling for years well why doesn't Donald Trump get trade embargoes or why does it mean issue sanctions against Saudi Arabia well probably for a lot of reasons the first of which being\nWe don't usually don't issue saying some sanctions and trade embargoes over one person somewhere disappearing or going ... we don't really have an explanation yet so yeah that does affect a lot of people's jobs a lot of people's businesses we do a lot of business with Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia trustworthy country now it's pretty much\nISIS with the un suits that's basically what Saudi Arabia is they had people in the streets and\nYou know the human rights don't really exist in Saudi Arabia is just an abomination there but the Saudi king Solomon been\nAbdul is as did you think I did a good deal good on his name they're close enough right Chris Saudi king Salman been Abdul is is already had a phone conversation with Turkish president Erdogan and this this is a dictator talking to a dictator I don't know who I trust why is\nThat is conversation yesterday and uh", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "15"}
