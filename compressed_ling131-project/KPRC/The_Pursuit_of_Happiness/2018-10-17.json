that you're Native American where's the proof that your Native American show me the money show me the just a little bit of evidence here and for years and years and years and years and years people have been talking about this and then back in July\nDonald Trump apparently made this claim\nThat he would pay a million dollars if only Elizabeth Warren would take a DNA test so she did sort of\nThere's a guy at Stanford University he's a geneticist this is sort of what he does for a living and he had her take a test and the tests confirmed she is Ninety five percent\nEuropean Ninety five percent European Ninety five percent the people who\nKilled the Native Americans and took their country those darn European shame on them of course you know this happened hundreds of years before she was born she couldn't be blamed for it any more than [laughter] than Donald Trump good but I digress she is having a moment here this is a big exciting day for the Democrats and\nAfter all when you're when you're Ninety five percent not Native American that must mean you're five percent Native American right\nWell no not exactly that's not exactly the case either you know the minimum requirement to claim membership but most Native American tribes as wanting the Trump wants to be twelve point five percent so she's five percent not European\nWe don't even know if she's five percent Native American\nThey know according to this geneticist who just so happens to be a researcher a professor at Stanford University which is an incredibly liberal university on the west coast which just so happens to be a place where she has a lot of friends who are professors and people involved in an academic I'm sure not a coincidence\nWell well this person found the camera or less than five percent of whatever she is\nIs not European could that be that she's a Native American you\nKnow the reality is at best she's about one sixty fourth Native American but barely qualifies as anything that's not even [laughter] that's not that's not enough to qualify as actually being a Native American\nSo the Boston Globe it's a newspaper that spent years start trying to protect torn on this issue in and has already had it issued a correction on this piece for overstating warns Indian ancestry ancestry they broke the details of orange DNA test\nAnd and the analysis earlier today\nThe articles author is

Ninety five so this benefited her career in academic\nAssuming the DNA test is accurate weren't could still make no claimed to membership in the Cherokee tribe\nThe eastern band Cherokee Indians as a minimum thresholds one sixteenth blood quantum and the United the Taliban's threshold is one quarter blood quantum I'm\nNot a geneticist I won't pretend that I have done the or have done the test on this myself but here's what this really means let's say hypothetically any grain of is destroyed all which I don't think it is that would mean that if she goes on line to DNA dot com or ancestry dot

the building where Saudi journalist he's a he's an American Jamal 'cause soggy disappeared nearly two weeks ago guy wrote for the Washington Post\nIt's been claimed to there's a report that he went into the consulate and he was murdered\nAnd reports on that very about I've seen some dark\nExplanations out there on the Internet for what happened to him um I won't even begin to try to figure it out but the team arrived by on marked police cars at the council and said nothing to journalists waiting outside as they entered the building\nPolice Bush back the journalist from the front of the

interrogation so this is a new report from CNN\nBut remember this is CNN's the kind of take that as a grain of SALT I don't it's not that I don't believe that that's what would happen I totally believe\nThat it's possible that that is a very likely explanation but when CNN is the source point you got to be skeptical about this I mean we all know we all know how often they are misleading on things like this\nThey had an interview with Donald Trump on sixty minutes over the weekend and they asked him about this they almost kind of asked him about this as if they were blaming him\nI'm I'm not really sure that it's fair to blame Donald Trump for this but you know how the media will blame him for anything\nThe media loves the media will blame Donald Trump for this missing journalist if they thought they could get away with it because you know why why not it's a it's a fun story for them it's fun for their viewers to believe that Donald Trump is somehow involved in this part of the reason why they're mad at M. Y. Y. CBS would even suggest\nThis journalist missing in in ... in in Turkey that disappeared at the consulate there is somehow the fault of Donald Trump is because they think Donald Trump has a friendly relationship with Saudi Arabia it's almost like they've never seen those photos a bronco bomber bowing down\nTo the king of Saudi Arabia Saudi crown prince anyway here's Donald Trump on CBS on sixty minutes yesterday being asked about the missing journalist and I'm a computer ...\nMiles a shovel the journalists and journalism is was he murdered by the Saudis and did the prince skim the order to kill him\nWhen nobody knows yet but we'll probably be able to find out it's being investigated as being looked at very very strongly and we wouldn't be very upset and angry if that were the case as of this moment they deny it ended that denied the mentally could it be them yes\nChallenger son in law just got on the phone and asked the prince did he didn't deny after\nThey deny it they denied every way you can imagine in the not too distant future I think we'll know an answer\nWhat are your options let's say they did what are your options would you consider imposing sanctions as a bipartisan group of senators proposed\nWhat depends on what the sanctions and give me an example they ordering military equipment\nEverybody in the world one in that order Russia wanting it China wanted it we wanted it we got it\nAnd we got all of it every bit of it or would you cut that ... well I Would I don't want to do going ...

need an ID to go outside and get some cigarettes you need an ID to get sued affect\nYou need an idea to drive a moped right don't you in some states I think that's not an all of them are the point\nIs

currently a Democrat but but maybe not a complete moron first of all the headline of the article is all the good beta headlines have been used yeah she's right the point I don't know if you get the joke there what she's saying is all the op ed writers on the left have written\nAn insane amount I mean the the number of flattering fan boy pieces about pay to work from leftist is staggering there's so many of these articles they published at this point\nAnd then the sub headline is\nThere's a much covered Texas representative looking to unseat Ted Cruz stand a chance to question mark and what if he gulp loses question mark well we've been here before and then she goes on to talk about\nWendy Davis and other rising stars of the DNC you ended up being a bit disappointing little lackluster I'm a

there'll be plenty of things for him to do when he loses to Ted Cruz he'll probably go run for president realistically will he when great question\nI don't know I mean we went in the DNC nomination is the first question I don't think he could be Trump Trump is very popular right now something big laptop to the next two years the Trump is reached a point here\nWhere he's he's hit peak outrage from people on the left and it's not working anymore every day you can't cry hysterics and think that people are going to listen to you you know the boy who cried wolf Chicken Little there's only so much we can take from people on the left\nIn terms of hyperbole in sensationalism against Trump until people started to realize hey wait a second they're not putting gay people into internment camps they're not killing all the Muslims the number of black people shot by white cops isn't gone up at a staggering amount it doesn't change things are better not worse than they were before Trump\nIf things are getting better under Trump and not worse how could he lose how could they say how can they say come election time that they were right\nWell they can't anyway\nSo paint on my Ron what do

wisdom says you know men on a mission to retire American one version other moms\nLooking back to do on the radio show with me here today Scott an offshoot of Houston marketing Woodward multifamily mentors there and I'm Scott\nWe've been talking about the opportunities here nationwide how we really opened up the you know the the opportunities by going to all these different cities [noise] however you or it may mentioned\nThat there have been some very favorable metrics in the Houston area market and wanted to share with us you know do you believe in your heart of the people that put out the metrics do they believe that we've bounced that we hit the bottom were coming back\nYeah so uh the large brokers the IRA is marks and Mila chap CPR is all these guys do quarterly a presentations on where they're saying the market and some of the metrics that I picked out of those that I think really form\nA bottom added up turn at what we're seeing here are are taking shape and they seem to be across the board these guys are all saying it\nUh one of the things I have to say a Curtis is chasing a class say I know you've got a bucket list that you want to buy a class say and I have had conversations with both of you think telling you that you're crazy why would you want to go after this when things are so good and the B and C and that's the bread and butter word that's got us where we are for the last twenty five years\nHowever uh I have a solid B plus property and the Galleria area and while Eighteen months ago I thought there was such a big gap between the rental property and the new construction and class say stuff that we were going to be immune to downward pressure from these guys as they've done a great job of over building can\nAre really having to deal out huge concessions to get their places filled up\nDidn't think we'd feel it at my place there but we did\nAnd it it's not bad it's not unbearable but but we felt it now what's happening in this class say stuff things that a year ago I was seeing all around me and I live right in that area too so I I watch it\nUm things that were thirty percent occupied and giving three months free Fifteen months it's starting to farm up I went and did a search on my own after I saw the data come out of these guys and I looked at all those places on a subscription service that I I look at\nAnd they're all Seventy Seventy five even eighty five percent now there's a new batch of them coming online now that some of them are below ten percent because they just come on line right by my house or inside the loop there but the stuff that I got up struggling a year ago it's farmed up and some of those things have even been able to refinance now\nThat they're above Seventy five percent were usually we think Ninety percent of the magic number on our stuff so [noise] the capitals banks agencies wherever the financing we're starting to back these deals in\nA ... and it looks like they're they're saying a bottom there's one deal on the market right now [noise] person built it for a hundred Seventy five thousand a couple of years ago before things turned out they could have sold it for two ten but they were holding out because their goal was to twenty five to thirty five\nNow they've got an aspiring alone and they're going to bail out of it for a hundred and eighty five thousand door they still make ten thousand adore building that deal with the person that's buying it firmly believes that in the next five years we're going to see a return and they're going to be able to sell that for two twenty five or something like that within the next five years so\nI think the model that you and courtesy of actually been tracing I've been wrong on it and I think you guys have had the forward vision a little better than I have and\nThings like ah those classes rights are up a couple of percentage points now the margin between the the rats when the rents are starting to grow again I've seen my occupancy growing in the gallery at that project I was talking about so everything started to shape up really well\n[noise] yeah just for those who are listening for the first time they're not saying by ... for a hundred and Seventy five thousand they're seeing a hundred and Seventy five to two hundred and twenty five thousand per door image per unit\n[laughter] ... [laughter] yeah 'cause\nI was looking at looking at the one the other day a class here so I can do if there's a big difference for between a syndicator Anna ... and I'm I'm trying to ... I don't know I may have to syndicate one just to do one but I'm trying to do it as as I wrote preferred to that way\nBut the differences is that there becomes the depth of cash you can actually come up with it so you look at these things is okay let's say it's a hundred and fifty thousand a door that's a decent number and you know you got two hundred units that's thirty million dollars right\nBut if you got three hundred units that's forty five million dollars and that's a big difference when you got to put twenty five percent ... percent closing costs you're talking thirty percent of thirty million compared to thirty percent of forty five million that's half the difference in what you have to come up with\nAnd so I found that you know I'm not afraid to buy the expensive stuff\nBut I don't think I could buy the three and four hundred unit that makes sense\n[noise] Oh absolutely you're talking about a different ... five million dollars and those two scenarios that you played out there that's a lot a lot of cash come up with and\nIt's a situation where I think you're dealing with slightly lower returns that were used to you know a year to year basis however I think there's big capital gain that's out there at the end of the rainbow for those deals\nWell the you know it makes sense\nGiven given both of those or neither of those the way I look at it as is\nTen years from now classes will be classy minus or a class B plus and they will be the center of the market\nNo doubt there will be building properties are going to be you know selling like you say two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand or people will be paying three thousand bucks a month or read it's going to happen that there is no doubt about it it's going to happen and so if you think about it\nWhen I first got in Scott I was buying sixties and seventies construction I bought several he's really cool no see I got started eighty seven eighty eight eighty nine that area so I was buying stuff in Seventy ... subtly ten years old this is not bad\nUh by the time I'd been in ten years I was buying stuff in the seventies and started buying stuff in the eighties\nAnd I bought ... struck construction was like wow clasby stuff this was incredible this unbelievable but man we're we're not talking about two thousand Seventeen I've been touched up is now like dead it's fifty sixty years old somewhere those buildings you have to wear out give up and go away so\nIt's kind of would appreciate you coming on the show today thank you for coming on thank you for being a mentor even the

policies worked in Texas you can't be anti gun pro socialism raised taxes single payer healthcare medicated for all this isn't stuff that even moderator centrist\nTexans are going to embrace much less conservatives in constitutional lifts and libertarians anyway so it works talking last night\nOne of the things that came up is whether or not he supports late term abortion and some people have tried to\nSome people have tried to argue there's no no no no ... and an extremist on abortion well whatever your feelings are on abortion I got to think that you would agree that late term abortion is a bit upsetting O'Rourke is a longtime supporter of abortion rights in October twenty Seventeen\nOr he was working in the house in the U.S house at about twenty to thirty seven to one eighty nine the bill was called the pain capable unborn child act essentially this was a measure that would effectively ban abortions\nAfter ... weeks ha late term abortions in a work was one of the mostly Democrats who voted no on this so\nWhen we're trying to if you're not against banning late term abortions than what what would what would that mean about you\nTake away the double natives means you're for\nLate term abortions right another thing that was thrown around last night debate over our vote for a ten dollar barrel tax on every barrel of oil and Texas yeah he did he absolutely did\nThis happened back in twenty sixteen the claim goes to the days of president bronco Obama he had proposed a ten dollar tax on every barrel of oil paid for by energy companies to fund railways as if anybody's riding on the railways\nAnd House Republicans are twenty sixteen introduced a resolution opposing the proposal or quoted against it work is since defended his vote similarly her this is the same guy who voted
