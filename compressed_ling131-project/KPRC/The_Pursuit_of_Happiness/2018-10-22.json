mission to retire America One person at a\nMonth and he\nLooked back to their homes and British show today we're talking about the seasons of your life and I'm Talking about how I was wrong I Believe that's probably only lived at age sixty five and here I Am sixty two um I've been thrown every kind of physical ailment fitness problem and\nInjuries that can be thrown at you and I'm Still kicking that feels better than I ever felt before my life uh stop drinking alcohol about three weeks ago or just to prove that I could to everybody around me and\nDefinitely clarified my mind so now I'm back and I'm sitting here in this situation where I've gone through the seasons of my life to where each and every season I succeeded in becoming successful to the point where it seems like it's time to stop\nRight okay I've done it I Can't see any further because you can't see all the way down the line guys you can only see as far as you can see when you get there you change your mind people come in here they are afraid to buy their first read house\nThen they buy three or four red house and all of a sudden they finally decided by small apartment complex then they want to buy a larger part because then they want to be a syndicator uh it just you grow and grow because you get you can't see yourself being all that being that wealthy being successful you just don't see it in yourself\nA but when you get there you can see further and\nThat is each season as you re address who you believe yourself to be when you re address that that's when you grow while you were in the process of doing stuff\nAnd and mastering something I don't know really if that growth other than just that's starting to uh what would be the right word for it um\n[noise] your your your perfecting a skill set now somebody would call that growth um and I couldn't argue that point but it's in my mind is something slightly different and said okay we're going through the grind again we're doing we're ... we're learning it were mastering it\nBut it's not really growth growth happens the day you get to the end of that and yeah we did it now what\nNow you look outside of your circle of influence you look outside of your circle control in your life and you say what can I Do now\nWe're should I go now so it's sixty five sixty two years of age I'm asking myself what should I Do now where should I go now and by the way for we went to break I told you I Would tell you about these apartment complexes John and I bought these numbers are\nOr what is on my resume this is what John gave me um I assume they're accurate but if they're not they're only off by a little bit whatever but we bought an apartment complex which is two hundred and fifty six units\nWe bought it for four million eight hundred thousand we sold it for seven million six hundred thousand and by the way there's more dollars that around and I'm up just to make it easy so you're talking about three million dollar gain their\nUh the next one we bought was two hundred and Seventy units we bought it for three million five we sold it for nine million for\nSo that's a five million nine hundred thousand dollar again on that apartment complex I realize these properties we're paying as cash flow for eight years also it wasn't like that's all we may that was what we made at the end after we had cash flow for eight years or we bought a three hundred and twenty unit apartment complex\nAnd you've got to listen to it you need to pay attention to this one we bought it for two million five hundred\nThousand dollars we sold it for fourteen million four hundred thousand dollars\nNow think about that\nThat's a twelve million dollar game on one apartment complex plus the cash flow for eight years can you even imagine can you imagine imagine the change in your life if you would have done this one\nProperty just one\nI look back now and I think to myself you know it's it's a shame that I did it with other people let other people and and the reason I let other people and it was because it was a point in Iraq what it was hard to get loans nobody gate law and so I said I can get loans I'm strong enough financially get him so I let other people getting a deal\nA but can you imagine if I Would have done that you'll just by myself make twelve million on one\nDeal I mean if if you look at these deals here the last one we did by the way we bought it for two point one million fold over five point five million that's three point four million dollar game\nSo that's Fifteen sixteen million\nAnd a that one right there three to nine will be six that's twenty two million and a that were right there was four to seven three that's twenty five million dollars of gains in eight years twenty five million\nIn eight years and\nYou just got to see that for what it is and that was that's just for deals we did there were hundreds if not thousands of deals being done during that time and all these lifestyles members made all this money and you're sitting here on the couch right now going well I don't know if\nI even got the guts to buy a house you need to get the guts to buy a house now here's the interesting point about all that that season was over made a massive return it made me wealthier in eight years that I had been\nThe previous ... years before that and there I was with nothing to do I didn't operate those properties John did all the operations island three other for the properties that Melissa ran I did nothing\nUh did radio shows four days a week on the radio that was it\nHad nothing to do\nAnd so that's when I started drinking because my mind was idle it had nothing to do I had to comment down\nBut now stop drinking so it's not comedy more so in the last six months I purchased for properties for apartment complexes that\nAdd up to be about eight hundred units\nAnd an addition to that I mean right now trying to buy the property and this one is going to be all by myself it's just a class or your ... and what's interesting on this deal is if it goes through is it all be making fifty thousand dollars a month but what broke\nSo it'll tell you that to proceed with just approachable you that you can make that what you would change in your life it's something to get excited about wrap your arms around let's go make another fifty grand about do we need that we don't really [noise] then you can think back and say well it's not really the money that is so it gets washed off of a wonderful day we'll see you tomorrow [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n... radio show

estimated seven thousand heading for the U.S border where they're willing to take their chances despite us efforts to stem the flow\nIn the afternoon you're alive right now I'm K. P. R. C. nine fifty in Houston more real Texas real talking almost set our own slogan there I have extra tuning in every body very exciting day to day in Texas all eyes are tuned to each town all over the country people are watching us hear what's happening today well it's a couple of things happening apparently there's this\nGuy named finances and he's he's Irish but he thinks he's Hispanic and he's driving around the city right now visiting polling stations\nAnd also you may know this guy is ... that's that's what he calls himself ... or work they do cruising around age town\nYou know lighten up a split listen to some ... some zero in the low ride well he ... some some lean that's not really what's happening but she is out right now trying to get people excited about his campaign as he has been I guess he had a thing in ... the other day\nWhere the attendance was so low that they had to move the venue or something like that I only heard about this from a listener I don't know I wasn't there but it works out a lot of rallies lately he's been having them all over the place and tonight I don't know if you guys heard about this\nBut tonight Ted Cruz has a little rally here in Houston yes it's true it was originally planned to be energy arena which is not\nThe football stadium at the energy stay no it's right outside of that he was originally going to be in the convention center next to where the Texans played football at and I guess that venue wasn't big enough they had not anticipated this many people would RSVP to attend the event\nThe word is that so far Seventy thousand people live RSVP and you know signed up essentially well they don't have enough room for that many people to get inside\nSo the original venue at room for eight thousand people in this current one has room for Eighteen thousand people a little bit of a difference there right probably they should of had this event\nAt where the Houston Texans played football happens that are having it at the Toyota Center where the rockets play and that's OK are still in ice venue it's still a big place still not big enough I was just down there with my producer Chris little and and this woman who works in our digital media department and they McHale up\nAnd they're both in their twenties they never been to a political rally or a protest before why as you know Ken left her junior a K producer Kenny I attend lots of protest I'm something of a protest savant I've been to the protests I've been to a T five been to occupy\nRallies or low rise a Tea Party rallies um the the the rights for illegal immigrants rally I've been all the rallies you know been doing it for years it's it's when I used to do in Chicago when I worked on the man show there I Would go to these\nPro illegal immigrant rallies which was a weird thing to do they're marching for the rights of people who don't have rights than it would seem weird to me anyway so we're down to the event today and and right before we leave\nI wanted to prepare the two youngsters you know I'm In my thirties they're in their twenties around millennials technically Christmas too young to be a millennial but we're all younger people we represent the younger voting class but me\nBeing in my mid thirties I Am the elder millennium no I'm the mature sophisticated one so I have to tell them you know what to get what to anticipate and I walk into the digital media room this morning and I said of the gang a you know it's\nThe people that run our Web sites and do video and social media for the company and I said I'm hey is there anybody here that can hold a camera for me and Chris little while we go down to the Trump rally we're going to walk around and get some footage\nAnd immediately McKay law one of one of the the women here in the digital media department says all go Emmett Kelly is very smart sweet very kind person so I look at her and I go I Would love to have you with us on the team today there's just one thing\nI Can't guarantee you'll be safe I don't know what it's going to be like down there in the ... down there with their masks on trying to fight people support I really built it up I\nI I wasn't trying to create a false sense of danger but that's sort of happened I intend to do this I tell in Chris McKay Lara dies be careful everyone stay close together you don't know what it's going to be like if you see people in masks don't get too close to him film them but to keep it healthy distance\nThere wasn't any of that down there first of all here all the stereotypes were broken I didn't see any leftist agitator so I don't know if there'll be there tonight but they weren't out early like I expected them to be and last time Trump was in Houston and he was here I think a little less than a year ago\nTraveling around the city going meetings and as that was happening I was following around his motorcade as were a lot of other media people\nAnd uh and at the time everywhere I went there were communist agitator they're left wing agitator is trying to rally people are trying to get excited looking for a fight looking for a riots\nFinally I you know I I after running into that at each of the events that Trump was at a less than a year ago I just assumed that this would be like that\nBoy did I have a wrong [laughter] really got it wrong we went down there and like I said it was truly every stereotype broken first of all it's not just a sea of white people very diverse there's Latinos for Trump's\nOr get ready for this there's a group down there called Muslims for Trump's yes Muslim well for Trump singular Trump while Trump's too I'm sure they like Eric and Don junior in a bunker and I know about Muslims for Trump\nLatinos for Trump African Americans were Trump L G beauty cue elemental pie for Trump all that stuff they're all down there I'm ... and ... and capitalism\nAnd its finest on every block everywhere you go right now surrounding the Toyota Center you will see on full display any kind of Trump merchandise you want to get any anything you name it from funny T shirts to the traditional maggot hat\nStuff from when he was on The Apprentice or the Donald ... that Donald Trump board game I mean everything is for sale if you want to buy it it's for sale\nEverything's for sale I wanted to hear some for some people right now the Trump rally by the way it's always open phone lines on

better radio shows and this one you know that one of the things I enjoy doing\nIs getting out there and sticking the microphone in the face of the left is protesters and asking them questions that

Johnson maybe Michael Barry played a clip 'em I Love talking to protesters I went all the way down there today and I couldn't find any\nSo instead I decided if I Can't talk to protesters I'm going to be the next big thing I'm going to get the crowd to cheer for silly nonsense so here you go\n[laughter] they weren't ready for that\n\nHow do you\nGet\nA brisket brisket got a big cheer bigger than

other thing I like to ask people who would win and if like Godzilla or King Kong\nGodzilla radioactive breath world\nYeah right nuclear firebombs right exactly but ... but don't don't write off King Kong he's pretty he's pretty quick yeah\nBut I Would generally vote today wants to solar was a lot of people voting lots of adults lots of people looked like they were on their lunch break or had to take an extended lunch for work and I get the feeling they're not all voting for Bobby France\nOr so or you don't have to say exactly where you live but what part of the city where are you voting and Katie [laughter] okay so yeah I mean Katie I Would expect that but but there are some ... you know you walk around and sold them around yeah usually um\nBeta signs however many\nBeta science is a lot a lot more Ted Cruz sons I don't know if Kavanaugh has something to do with these people are asking Ted and hiding in a restaurant or if enough people thought Nancy Pelosi speaker again they're God no\nOh yeah you said dude and and you know they did that to Haiti Cruz when she was out eating with her husband they did it to Mitch McConnell and his wife they did it again over the weekend they ransom\nThey I think they were eating a Cuban food or something and some guy at this restaurant in Louisville sits up and start screaming Mitch McConnell and he throws his doggy bag like you're throwing food waste that's away but I also\nSaw some of the other people in the restaurant we're about to throw down with a guy including a very large ... hats so is that she was our when you make a ... man it it's not going to be pretty like why there are protesters up lots of big guys and ... and ... cells\nYeah no you're right exactly you know this is taxes so I got to think of some of the tea for guys are probably pack into but not as much as people on the right our\nOwn little two guys are public schools ... in their basement or not we don't have basements this this close to the coast they're asleep in the garage apartment her mom spare room so they have the command center\nRight what kind of you but when they get good in math\nBut they don't have more money than they think they deserve but they really don't want to go work for they'll probably come out and try to protest and probably just get locked up by some of the Trump people\n[laughter] you know that we got an email here in the news room at ... case you are rich and keep your see you're connected and I think a lot of people know that their sister stations so the case here each newsrooms right outside the room where I'm doing this radio show and somebody in the newsroom got an email from the Democratic socialist to Houston\nSaying they would have a hundred people there are protesting it as soon as soon as I saw that I was like oh man let's go get in the car get Chris little got my producer let's do this and we couldn't they were nowhere to be found man maybe they just want to people to think that or

eight million dollars he's got to the other Senate campaigns around the ... the country that's you can't say you\nFavor socialism and not want to spread the wealth will thirty eight million dollars is a lot for senators campaign but it's not a lot for a presidential campaign and that's\nJust the ... ...\nOh yeah absolutely that this is all forbade don't know you nailed it neck forbade oh this is

charges so\nYeah she uh she he was he was once charged with burglary\nOr he tried to walk away from the scene of an accident at a DUI and hey look people make mistakes but part of my problem with NATO in his legal history is he's sort of tried to deny it he's tried to pretend to know he didn't leave the scene of the crime and even CNN left leaning CNN had to call 'em out on this plea\nHe along with law enforcement during Jim Crow yes that that are on\nThat and they're in the last debate it really got how he go get it out for I'm not representing\nConstituents because he was running for the
