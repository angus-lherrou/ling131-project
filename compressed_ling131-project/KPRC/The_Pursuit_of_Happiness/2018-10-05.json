printed page and I do get the desire to have something that is resistant to the sun so you can read outside during the summertime it's lots of people like do and well that's all good\nBut I only recently got into the idea of reading\nOn a device as opposed to reading a book and it happened one it happened during a flight I was traveling to see some family over Christmas and I've forgotten to bring my books and I was just like damn it I like to read\nChristmas Vacation is pretty much the only chance I get to read the way I like to read I really like to read and I forgot my books wow\nWhat

date on sale and trying to get people to buy tickets [noise]\nThat's a whole different kettle of fish but when he showed up to these things people then for the most part happy to see him [noise]\nApparently he did not address any of the scandal involving the me too situation and the fact that he used his power and influence within the comedy industry to put females in a position where they felt obligated to watch him [noise]\nAs George Cassandra as mom said to him treat his body like an amusement park or as the rest of the cast a Seinfeld said not be master of his domain [noise]\nSo there was that Lucy Kay [noise] came back again and he was greeted warmly by the crowd at another surprise stand up ... both of them are just relieved that his microphone was the only

today's Thursday\nToday's Thursday Thursday and you know what that means are now know are there there's plenty of things happening\nAnd today we're going to spend a little bit of time on Kavanaugh we're going to spend ... how could you ignore that we're going to spend a little bit of time on some economic issues I no money in numbers are boring but they're not boring when it's your money as it no it's not and the national debt has never been higher and he keeps going going going going gone this is something I complain about\nA lot government spending I've said before I'll take out at a Donald Trump red make America great again hat and I will wear it right now under one condition\nDonald Trump has to stop signing these Democrat like spending bills\nThe budget and the spending are totally out of control well the budget isn't so much of an issue it's the spending\nAnd the deficit and the national debt but maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm a crazy person I complain about this all the time government spending is is astronomical it's ... and and yet for some reason there never seems to be any consequences I don't know someday there probably will be in the meantime funny things are happening here today you might notice for those of you\nWho are listening on the radio on terrestrial radio and there are thousands of you out there so they are so much for tuning in\nI Love that you guys listen to the show when I wouldn't have a show if you didn't listen to it um but for those that are watching right now and Facebook Live that's another way to check us out you can also listen I heart radio but every day I Try to go live on Facebook Live which means it's very important that I shave\nAnd wear pants and so far I've done at least one of those two things I definitely shave this morning but no if you're watching me right now on Facebook Live you can see\nThat I have a little T shirt on our little teacher and I'm a big man who am I going to end the shirt says pirate pack pirate political action committee that's what a package and behind me there's a couple of science yesterday I showed you guys this sign I'm ... for those you I'm gonna try to paint a picture here for those you listening on the radio can't see what I'm doing\nI have these ... works\nScience behind me but they're actually not paid or work science it's satire their ... their ... a barrel rocket science here in Texas we love what a burger boy they're falling all over the place on trying to talk here in Texas we love what a burger and Chris would you agree with is that the ... kind of look like the what a burger spicy catch up\nIt's identical right like it's almost a is it a coincidence I don't think it's a coincidence\nHuh how dare you progressive taxes for co opting to what a burger brand task task you discussed me you sickened me you vial disgusting corporate co opting jerks anyway so so yesterday I showed you guys that's very funny somebody one of our listeners to young men actually made the sign\nAnd it it looks just like the ... sign but instead of being a regular ... rock sign it says his name is Robert O'Rourke not said oh he was one hundred percent Irish he's not he's zero percent Hispanic\nHash tag Robert F O'Rourke which is really funny I think really funny now another group of people uh the pirate pack contacted me online\nAnd they hit me up with some other ones they're making T shirts if you like the first sign all you have to do is contact them you can get a PDF from them and then you could go see my buddies Scott coots hatch over on west time or he owns a fast signs location it's near west highland fountain view it's by where the old\nToys R us says it's by were the toys R Us used to be which is a very old fashioned sentence and the ... and he's got a fast signs there and if you go in there and you tell him I sent you um\nHe'll he'll you know you don't have to tell him I sent you a homemaker besides regardless but there'll be there'll be extra special polite and sweet you if you tell them I sent you and they'll print some of these signs for you you just need to get the the Pdf file for my buddies so to find them go to hash tag\nRobert F O'Rourke and you'll find most guys now the pirate pack these are all all these funny signs\nThat I'm showing you guys on Facebook Live right now but you know that I'm describing are the people on the radio were created by just regular Joes who are concerned citizens and millennial aged conservative to these are young guys they're not they're not all stuffy zombies that work in Austin that are doing this political activism but this one says\nBeta instead of saying they do it says beta stop texting me\nPolitical ad paid for by pirate pac which I think is super awesome and I'm also wearing one of their T shirts today so anybody out there that go goes and does stuff like this if you take the time you know to people that live outside of ... that live outside of Texas maybe you don't understand the need for this\nTexas has a lot of beta ... work yard signs planted in front of people's houses in urban areas\nAnd there's a reason why you see those and you don't see the Ted Cruz science well there's two reasons why first of all Ted Cruz's core constituents\nThey live out in the country they live on big lots and stuff like that there would be no need for them to have a yard sign if you live on a ranch but there are Ted Cruz supporters who live here in the city there are a lot of them I can testify for it I drink beer with them every night and and just go out and hang out with them on the weekends I Know they exist because I I talk to them all day long\nBut there's a difference between us and them and one of the core differences of this we don't assault people for taking a political position that's different from ours and they do it on the wreck they do it all the time constantly and that's their that's their their their modus operandi right that's their MO they love\nTo get violent they want to have more laws I've made this point before but this is a great point to make about the left\nThey want to have more laws\nBut they also actively support breaking the laws it's the craziest thing it it it will blow your mind all over your face it's absolutely bonkers people on the left are hypocrites\nOf their own state has them they want the states to get bigger and bigger and bigger and they love the state has them oh we're worse if the government shower down your government on me oh but then when it really comes down to actually supporting these laws they hate the cops and\nAnd progressive constituents encourage their a progressive politicians encourage their constituents to go out and in public and create chaos it's absolutely bonkers it's

them get it over with I Am sick and tired of being sick and tired this thing is exhausting\nBrett Kavanaugh's hearing has become boring at this point\nIt's weird how hard we fought as conservatives and libertarians and people that are classified as the far right how hard we have fought to get a moderate on to the Supreme Court because when it really comes down to it folks this isn't about politics this isn't about ideological opinion\nThis is about the fact that Donald Trump won the twenty sixteen election and I say that if someone who was never his biggest cheerleader not by a long shot I was very critical of Donald Trump you can look at my old tweets\nThere are still up if it if Donald Trump had lost the election who would be getting on the Supreme Court who do you think they would have replaced Gorsuch with somebody on the far left\nWell I mean ... we wouldn't have Gorsuch is my point who do you think they would have replaced Kennedy with do you think that we would have got a moderate like Kevin Oh\nNo we wouldn't get a moderate like Kavanaugh it would be another member of the far left putting cabin on the Supreme Court was supposed to be an easy pick for Donald Trump I think we know the\nReal conservatives and liberty minded people in the pro life community wanted Amy Coney Barrett a Catholic\nAnd it would it and it would've been interesting to see them attack her\nShe's a Catholic mom with twelve kids or something like that and you know who else has fits the same description Nancy Pelosi was strangely enough just loves abortion and that's really what this is about they're making it into abortion when it's not a new abortion it's not an abortion issue folks Brett Kavanaugh is not the pro life Republican but they're making them out to be but I couldn't be wrong I don't know it'll it'll be interesting to see if\nIf the worst nightmare of the left comes true and they do get a vote again on roe versus Wade if we do if we do bring another roe versus Wade hearing to the Supreme Court I if we challenge it I think it's unlikely but you never know [noise]\nGet him and his day very listen to the pursuit of happiness radio [noise]\nEver it is

are also trying to backtrack and and put attention on some of the news stories that they haven't focused on over the last few weeks 'cause they would still obsessed with Kevin\n... and if you don't believe me listen to the segment that aired last night on MSNBC [noise]\nWe'll come back to MSNBC over the past few weeks\nOur newsroom like many other media outlets spending increased amount of time

the family some sort of a crisis the businesses in crisis they have to travel they fall behind on filing their taxes or the IRS says hey you know what you made a mistake you owe us money top tax\nWelcome back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time\nBomb sleigh\nLooking back to do on the radio show today we're discussing six different reasons why real estate\nInvesting or the investment in real estate is more profitable than any other types of investments other than maybe owning your own business\nOlive Bill Gates or\n... or anybody Warren Buffett who owns Berkshire Hathaway\nOr those types of businesses or any business for that matter run correctly is going to have the highest rate of return out there but real estate is one of those things is right there where the uh the next two we've done one through four so far first one was capital ... was captured that second one was cash flow\nThird one was appreciation for one was forced appreciation and number five is capital gains um\nWhen you look at a piece of real estate\nYou have something called capital gains it is not cash flow and it's not ordinary income\nAnd when you pull this money out it gets taxed at a lower tax rate\nOr it doesn't get taxed at all now we can take and force appreciation or forced a capital gain through real estate where you buy stock there's nothing you can do to force a capital gain we can force that capital gain\nBy improving the quality of the property or just improving the management of the property\nNow when this capital gain a curves what's different for us is that we don't have to sell the property to capture the capital gain we can refinance the money out and the money that comes out is tax free so I'll give you an example we buy property\nFor a million dollars we put two hundred thousand dollars down we get eight hundred thousand dollar loan and we go in there and we increase the income by just ten percent so the income was three hundred thousand a year a minus two hundred and expenses which gave us a hundred thousand dollars and not operating income that that operate in comes the amount of money we learn\nIf we own the property free and clear and\nAfter all expenses so we make a hundred grand a year now we take that up I temper said two hundred and thirty thousand by increasing the sales from three hundred to three thirty\nDrop to the bottom line three hundred thirty thousand dollar a hundred and thirty thousand dollars income now makes the property worth one point three million dollars\nWe now go back to the bank is that like a new eighty percent loan and they give us a loan for a one million fifty which is eighty percent of that\nOne point three and then we pay all the old one of eight hundred thousand dollars what do we walk away with his two hundred and fifty thousand dollars tax free\nAnd I remember we had to pay fifty thousand closing costs to do the ... actually we have ... fifty thousand to the second trash that you're actually a little less than that but it all with all would basically comes out to his about a hundred percent gain\nHow long does it take to make that game well in some cases\nJust ... property small enough we can get that all the stuff on the needs to be done to turn that around within six months larger poverty might take a year\nReally large property might take two years longest one I ever did was Eighteen months and in Eighteen months uh we made the property go up or should we bought it at Eight Belles door we put forward it we owned it for twelve we sold it for thirty five\nSo uh from\nFifteen to thirty buck twenty thousand dollars a door\nA type of gay that's a lot of money\nEspecially says it was like three hundred Twenty years or something like that so it was a it was a mass again and again just round those numbers off you don't have to have specific actual numbers to conceive what I'm Talking about but the very simple fact is now is in this case we did selves property but before we saw that we did a refund as we pulled out that equity tax free\nNow what's going through the last one year because we've only got a few seconds left here a few minutes ... minutes ... seconds and that's tax benefits what you can do with real estate is you can prolong paying taxes for the rest of your life you can differ differ differ and then get out of paying taxes by dying\nSo let's talk about all this time of differing all the taxes on the casual by using depreciation to cover it if you don't understand this go back to one of my other podcaster come to the summit arm teach at a used it for ... to pay no taxes on your casual\nYou could do that for the rest of your life you can do a ten thirty one exchange and sell the property by another one without encourage any capital gains you're Rowley whatever attacks a\nLiability you have to do next property and you could do that property up the property after property to you die that when you die your family is going to inherit that real estate in stepped up bases meaning all those all the difference between what you paid for it and what it's worth it\nWould be a capital game that all gone all the paid down mortgage\nAt all the depreciation taken to allow you to earn those Castro's free they all disappear completely disappear noticed so you look for when your family\nFor them to get to that money they would have to pay the taxes on the four oh one K. to get it out\nBut your family could inherit this real estate virtually tax rate up by the way we're not talking about inherited stacks we're talking about paying income taxes on the income that had been burned by you that you never pay taxes on you've never pay taxes on the casual you never pay taxes on the capital gains and you're given to them and they're not going to pay it either\nNow on your stocks if you had to do for what Jay and\nStocks go up ... or even if they're not for what can you give them stocks the difference between the basis of what you bought them for what they're worth\nIs going to be tax now if you had four one K. the dividends would not have been tax if they would also be ... if you had not had it set up for what you said in each year when you got the evidence you'd have to pay taxes on them she was talking about earning six different ways will say five different ways and not paying taxes are\nWe talking about race to return that you could say total up to a thousand percent return you could say average a hundred percent return if you put them altogether divided by the number of beers you owned a real estate\nIs easily easily\nFour or five ten times better than any other investment out there that my friends to discussion ahead with this lady as we sat there\nAnd ate dinner and enjoyed liked worrying about where to put a couple of million dollars that you don't know what to do what a problem that\nRemember always though this is it about the money it's about the lifestyle have a wonderful day we'll see tomorrow\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] ah\n\nRadio show every time you get obtained there was no you join us

trial of a Chicago police officer who killed a teenage burglary suspect they read the verdict moments ago Fox is just not to do is live in Chicago\nThis is special be great for Texas because Texas\nHas remarkably low unemployment compared to the rest of the country and you know why\nBut because of our our great business climate and our oil business\nYes absolutely we are very friendly to businesses here we don't over regulate people to death when they do in California where they just passed a law that says that you can't have a corporation with a board that has no men on it yeah which is a weird thing right that's like saying if you and your buddies just finished up college and you want to go to Silicon Valley\nSo they're saying that even limited private corporations limited liability corporations like an El Al see they have to have a female on the board\nGreat question I haven't dug that deeply into it but that's the impression I've gotten but a publicly traded one yeah\nWithout a doubt yeah it and it is it's a tricky thing here what what's the undergo from that is maybe just to chase businesses out of California\nWell they do in a really good job without that Truman Calif\nAnd yet is it their biggest problem is that they're California but the best thing about Texas is that we're not California anyway job growth slumped in September\nUm but the unemployment rate hits the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine here's what that means the unemployment fell two tenths of a percentage point to three point seven percent I don't want to bore people with numbers here so that's not what most of the show is but let's just get this out of the way this is good stuff non farm payrolls just rose a hundred and thirty four thousand\nWell below estimates of a hundred and eighty five thousand the worst performance since last December when the labor strike\nWaited on numbers now the closely watched average hourly earnings component showed a to point eight percent year over year increase and again I don't want to bore people details but what does all this mean the economy is still growing that we're still in a bull market well it\nAlso may mean some of those unemployment numbers meaning that employers are actually having a hard time finding people to fill those jobs right so you know if if wages are going up and yet the um the payroll is is slowing a little bit it means they're having a hard time finding people to fill those jobs\nAnd one of the great things about a good economy is that you get a little extra money in your pocket which means that you can have the privilege of ... spending money on stupid thing mhm so the other day I bought a lego what a burger action figure place that\nYeah you see it on line and you can get it done you can

thirty four Ninety nine you can purchase your own little build your own what a burger and if you if you're willing to spend a little extra money in your intellect does\nGet to see giant robot legs put
