in on that legacy of making your prove all sorts of scary [laughter] well well all know soon enough green poop creme ... something people just love talking about on social media for some weird reason\nDo from different studies in the past we know that food can affect dreams and the quality and they were going to be looking at specific mixtures of proteins that can actually disrupt a

like we have nightmares I Can't\nI Would ever sign up for nightmares\nI don't know if I make myself a guinea pig and that just because good sleep is so hard to come by nightmares or to not the fun kind of scary [noise]\nActually to be honest with you though I haven't had a nightmare and a very long time trying to remember the last one I had oh man so [noise]\nThey don't qualify as a nightmare but\nThere was a ... do you um are you are you going to like do self hypnosis apps stuff like that [noise]\nI don't know if they ever you know actually do the stuff that they're going to say that they help you do I wouldn't count too heavily on 'em but just me you know the whole you know this hypnosis I can make you a better person or make you quit smoking or whatever but um one thing I found was\nThere was a couple of them that really helped me knock out on planes doesn't matter how hard I Try and relax on a plane I Can't sleep but I found that with a couple of hypnosis apps\nThat basically just go hey you're getting sleepy count backwards from whatever the hell numbered as a as I could wake up on the other end which was actually kind of cool when I was flying a lot\nIt was really really helpful I was flying a lot not getting a chance to sleep regularly because of work and things of that nature so the fact that it helped me get a little bit of rest on planes these hypnosis abs I really liked and there was this one company ... uh she was mined by mind maybe that was a company that\nI haven't used them in a while but this was a company that I I got 'em all from and they're all completely reliable but then I noticed when the company came out with a couple of new ones there was a twist at the end of a\nI guess it was meant to be healthy thing but they said hey and you know tonight\nTonight after you go to bed early in the morning after you've gotten all this really great sleep that you're going to get because you're going to sleep better as a person in general you're going to have venting dreams and\nDarned if they didn't change the quality of my dreams these hypnosis apps and I stopped listening to him because of venting dream I guess there's maybe where you let go of a lot of stuff I don't know if this is a term that exist maybe you're a mess\nA practitioner you know something about it maybe it was just something that the people at the hypnosis app company came up with but I Will start going like oh my God\nEvery single time I listen to one of these things is that I Would have vending dreams and I don't know it wasn't really something that I Would sign up for voluntarily so I might give the nightmare inducing Burger King sandwich\nAnd the big old ... you try to get back to me [noise] let me know how that works out for you [noise]\n[noise]\nA great way to get over break up according to doctors is to have sex with your ex yeah apparently the best way to get over someone after a break up is to get back on top of them and then perhaps underneath them and then side by side with them and maybe on top of him again for good measure because believe it or not according to a new study\nOut of Wayne State University in Detroit that doctors they're determined that one of the best ways to get over your access by getting on with him one last\nThe researchers say that people who did that with their acts after a break up were less likely to be depressed and felt better overall on a day to day basis why well they say that having that final her on one more time actually gives you a real sense of closure which can help you start to move on and and now you know\nThe counters did okay and the ratings that counters it okay and the ratings on Tuesday night at average ten point six million viewers\nAlthough that number might climb a bit wants TV aren't delayed viewing are factored in there a couple of ways to look at that on one hand it was exactly where it Roseanne left off this past spring when ten point six million people watched the season finale on may twenty second but it was down from last season's premier\nWhich attracted sixteen point six guy Eighteen point four million viewers\nNow some might say that it's down because Roseanne bars and on the show any more\nBut it's hard to make the direct correlation because last season it was coming back after having been off the air for twenty Twenty one years and there's tremendous anticipation rabbit and this season it was coming back after being off the air for five months of the big question is now that the hype and curiosity factor has gone will the ratings settle in\nAnd whatever that number is it'll be hard to say whether or not it would have been better with\nOr without Roseanne speaking of watching things and onto than viewing and all the above your here's a story I promised we'd get two for whatever reason people are tweeting about all the things today's kids are missing out on by growing up in the Netflix era here some of the

time but at least for part of the time I guess he's trying to sound like me and which I that's I appreciate people doing fun character voices\nI built a radio show that revolves around ... character voices I find character voices are great I just don't understand doing fun character voices while you're being videotaped breaking the law\n... I mean I Am\nI it's I have a far fetched extreme opinion on this folks I'm gonna go ahead and just be controversial here I don't think you should vandalized people's property while you're doing ... voices and this has become common place at the last day he's very proud of themselves as he does it he's patting himself on the back any kind of makes the kid who's filming him I don't know who the kid was the videotape that\nOne of our listeners apparently because he had just in the video and the video went wow will be viral people are pretty upset about this rightfully so do you remember this isn't the first time that a bailout\nSupporter gotten nutty recently it's it's happened it's happening more common than you think unfortunately in fact uh it happened with tiny crews remember Heidi cruise cruise walking around it's Ted Cruz's wife\nAnd I I guess for some reason somebody just decided oh are we should attack Heidi cruiser Ted Cruz while they're trying to eat dinner so that's exactly what they did Steve ... warned us about this just the other day he told us this is a problem violent leftist are\nYou know you're seeing more and more this from the left and and there's no place for them what I wrote about was that when you see these kinds of things being said it is inciting people and frankly it's not the direction that we should be going it's not what our country is all about they were great country that that celebrates the facts\nIn the report they wanted to be classy and that's fine I did it anyway\nThe man in walk to a nearby P.

problem violence on the left is a problem right now it's helping tones down a little bit what could we do to get them to calm down I guess in order to get them to come down and we just have to lose an election well I don't think we're going to be doing that anytime soon if you're just do it again I gave a host of reasons why the Democrats shot themselves in the ... next month\nWhen the November midterms come around they're not going\nTo do that well I predict that Beto O'Rourke loses by double digits and I think most people know that at this point\nThese polls always lean a little to the left\nSo if cruises had by nine the real numbers probably more like Eighteen they never call me the recall you guys say never call any of us are another thing we were discussing earlier was the need for a stronger border four thousand people\nSlowly approaching our southern most border right now among Mexico there in where are they now Guatemala and there's four thousand of them good lord that's a lot of people\nWell there's a reason why we're concerned about four thousand people approaching the border and if you don't understand this\nTake a good look at the Democratic Republic of Congo it's a place over in Africa you ever heard of it it's a pretty big continent overseas and the world Health Organization announced the Congo's latest outbreak\nOf the deadly Ebola virus is not considered a global emergency but it's definitely an emergency in their country and who are they boarded by Rwanda and one other country and people that we know that this is going to spread like wildfire it's heading into those countries very soon it's going to be a real problem\nSo here's a look at the outbreak a hundred and eighty five confirmed cases a hundred and seven deaths since it was declared an August first it's a pretty short time ago did you guys you remember we ... a ball that come to America during the Obama era\nWhy do you think it has it made its way here yet during the Trump era a ... you probably know the answer to this one\nOkay it's probably because Trump isn't mail ordering Ebola patients and having them delivered to the United states like Obama did so why is this region being compared to a war zone World Cup of different reasons first of all there's multiple rebel\nGroups over there in the Congo they've killed hundreds of people in recent years they've had attacks and Benny which actually\nIs the center of Ebola containment uh area but\nRight now you know a hundred people get slaughtered by rebel groups a hundred people get slaughtered by Ebola what's worse tomato tomato would you rather\nWould you rather vomit blood to death or or have some eleven year old child soldiers stab you with a with a ship while while he while he looks down at your core obscene you bleed to death so there is some resistance this is the first time and he pulled outbreak has occurred in this part of the Congo\nAnd health workers are trying to explain the importance of safe burials in preventative measures to the people that live in that area here's the problem with people that live in that area\nThey don't get it they they don't understand they're not listening they don't trust the health professionals there actually is um there actually is a vaccine for Ebola and while it's not a hundred percent effective it works pretty well\nBut these government health care workers are walking around going hey everybody you live in a third world hell hole you know this is what what how to Trump's people describe\nIt it's a ... you know one whole I mean this is exactly what kind of country that is sad this is happening there walking up and going hey we got a solution here for you just got to take this vaccine do you want it\nYeah I don't want it now they don't want to be saved they don't want to be helped I don't know it's crazy by the way you know the fun thing about this Ebola is actually the is actually the Mexican word of the day to day\nMe andme egos are you having trouble assimilating into the New America well then maybe what you need is the Mexican American word of the day\nIs Mexican American word of the day is what is the Mexican American Translation of the word Ebola sleepy Fernando to use it in a sentence the blood ... he's not good at playing poker Monday but not really good the sleepy Fernando Mexican American word of the day now maybe you won't be so stupid that they\nWere\nFor the past couple of months all people could talk about was Brett Kavanaugh now that he's on the Supreme Court people seem to forget that they were outraged about that pretty quickly outraged people have a Fifteen minute memory they don't remember that there are upset about something\nYou tell them you tell them something that upsets them they get really angry and then a squirrel runs by invade or works case blind squirrel and they're they're just distracted by well\nFalse allegations of rape are pretty serious problem we don't have any real statistics about how many people are falsely accused of rape because\nThey were falsely accused we don't know what we don't know but he was a story I wanted to share with all this just happened in Pittsburgh recently remember when the ... I Believe all women think about that as I tell you about this story there's a group of high school girls in Pittsburgh\nThey didn't like one of their male classmates as a group of girls didn't like one guy\nSo they claimed that he sexually assaulted them what one of them know all of them he sexually assaulted all of them\nThat seems that seems pretty ambitious for a claim your but okay so they escorted him out of school in shackles they cuffed him up charged him with crime he spent the entire summer wearing an ankle monitor stuck indoors\nJust what the girls are now admitting\nThey made it up ... ... ... that male student is now suing the Pennsylvania School district the girls admitted on tape they may not be assault story one of them actually sent I just don't like him I Would do anything to get him expelled the false allegations were life derailing for the accused\nWho by the way it is referred to as T F in the lawsuit 'cause he's a kid he was a child these people are under age we don't know what their real names are\nHoping first started on October third back in twenty Seventeen one of the girls told other students AT T F a T I that's the boy's name had sexually assaulted her in a pool\nSo uh this is Pittsburgh area a cynical valley guidance counselor overheard the accusations you know it was a school\nAnd reported it to the states child abuse prevention agency which I guess it's called child line I don't know if do we have anything like that in Texas I guess we probably do I don't know if it has the same name now this is a requirement by ... something that they have to do so\nSwiftly charged with indecent assault and harassment and receive six months of probation is part of a ... months passed by six months of probation\nThin in March twenty Eighteen T. F. again falsely accused they do they do tend to get a second time\nAccording to the lawsuit happened more than one another girl inviting them over to a house party a few days later she told the school guidance counselor that he had broken into her home and sexually assaulted her this kept happening and happening to the kid well when is enough enough\nFinally they get a tape they get an audio recording of these girls admitting that they made the whole thing but the whole thing just kind of ruined his life just could've kept him out of college I guess it doesn't matter and it didn't matter if they kept Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court they didn't care it didn't matter at all just as much as they didn't care\nBrett Kavanaugh did it they didn't care if it had really happened to Christine Blasey Ford 'cause they don't care about Christine Blasey Ford and they never did I'm kind of junior even listen to the pursuit of happiness radio get caught up on the podcast got to keep

back [noise]\nYou know it's not easy to be single when you're on the right\nEarlier this week it was a news story about the make America date again website it's a clever enough name\nAppealing to young Trump gators Trump Trump supporters looking for somebody to date them not the first time we heard about this there was another website called Trump's singles\nAnd now they're they're well now there is this for Donald ... that's how they described it unfortunately it was a botched execution within twenty four hours of the make America date again website being on the line\nSomething very embarrassing happened\nIt turns out they had a little security exposure and they accidentally docks all their users all the users' data on the website was exposed within twenty four hours and I I think we all know what happens to conservatives when we're out it on the Internet it's it's not conservatives dinner harassing people on the left in public places\nI was blown away by this it's gotta be hard to be single when you're a conservative or a Republican or a libertarian or constitutional is whichever little sub genre you put yourselves into and I needed some commonsense I needed somebody to help explain to me maybe what somebody could do if they were in this predicament I I happen to be married but I have a lot of friends\nSo I reached out to the funniest guy I Know who lives in Washington DC very specific Venus an author and a stand up comedian well known to pursuit of happiness radio listeners the last\nHeadliner of one of our operation comedy therapy shows live right now via D.C comedian Tim Young author of I hate Democrats I hate Republicans welcome to the show certain\nYou know I really feel like we can do about ... minutes on how I don't understand how you're

time and You're welcome to Lone Star state moms Tim Young Tim Young spent a little bit of time in Austin anybody judging him right now and it's like a central east coast comic that he would he is he's been around\nHalf\nOf so So Tim you weren't Don make America great again website where you\nKnow but you know when I saw that stuff go up and when I see those things go up I just assumed that they are like fishing expeditions ph fishing so that people can get information on a Trump supporters and ducks them at this point so they can harassed them I just feel like that's where the world is now you should be careful\nHow do you think that would you really think of that that's what this was\nToo I mean look what happened\nYou know this could be a bunch of different ways either but that was\nA joke on my Facebook the other day or somebody posted that up because I think complaining about 'em and find stuff that's going on in dating apps here but I I said immediately say scene duck the\nRight it does seem ducks yes it does say there was a similar thing for people on the left although they didn't get expose there there was a website for Bernie Sanders singles called feel the burn beta dating I was that what it was called beta snows called seal the burning I think a lot of people thought it might be a dating websites where people with genital herpes but not the case [laughter]\nI I'm Sorry I Trump's your joke with mine\nAnd they were good jumps I feel like we're given the listeners plenty of laughs western right you don't know which way it's coming from [laughter] shirt combat speaking speaking of\nSo Tim would never used one of these dating websites well what do you think about this what is a young single or possibly middle aged single conservative or libertarian to do\nWell here's the thing so I Do is I I use all the apps because uh that's what I Do in the middle of meetings I don't like games on my phone I like actually use\nThe apps just entertain myself so I've got tender bumble I'd like one or the other ones but like\nSo in the middle of long conversations and this is in a major have like the the Ninety three seven Democrats or Republicans\nAre and I'm I'm I'm well no and I'm currently decently well known so people can gloomy very easily they find out I'm a comedian my name is and it's a hard to find me\nA day hundreds of thousands of followers like it's not hard to find him things\nThat things are going on the Twitter things are going on a Twitter I've two hundred and eight that far but who's counting\nUh so if the people who made these\nWomen and in the middle of it no lie all have a great conversation on that and and one the other day says\nHold on it seems like you're a Republican\nDress up for re co workers let's address so how did you address it\nI said I Am and then I put up a little gift and the guy eating popcorn to watch her just literally unravel in the chat and then another one woman said\nShe doesn't like Republicans I was like well don't you like differing opinions catch you you know like don't you like the painting with people and she goes I Do and then she went on this long thing I Love hearing difference of opinion and it was long paragraph that I should have had ready to read it because I said to all of\nUs\nThat she goes into how Republicans are ticket and hateful and disgusting people and how dare they you know do things like I guess past tax report to save everybody money\nOr whatever but she she\nLiterally wanted and I was like wait a second just contradicted yourself and she continued to flip out and I just literally just screen chop the entire thing it was great\nWow so that was that huh I I I I guess it didn't work out with her ... do you do go out on dates you know you're on dating websites you're doing it\nBut you're still single so is that just said that maybe a Republican just can't find success on the sides and you're not even really a Republican you're just vaguely on the right I mean by my political standards I don't think of you is like a makeover oh\nNo I'm [laughter] like the other day someone asked me there's the horrible comedy toward that going around there like why aren't you a part of it I'm like 'cause I'm not a deplorable and that the term for three years ago get over it\nThough I heard about I mean\nYou got these guys that are like heart like I I God Bless them one you know don't jumped out of office whether it be a couple of years from now or you know whatever\nAh their careers are over because they pitched to that but like you know I'm I just right and I believe in the policies on policy by talking it's amazing where we are as a country right now and how literally the term ticket it's when you shut down somebody for not taking the same way that you do\nAnd that's what really what's happening is we're saying that's like getting reaction everything is everybody has to be such an extreme at this point\nYeah it's true 'cause everything everything isn't extremism to people that everyone's\nThat extremist except for people think like you that's the new standards I hate to even bring this up but what is it being called the jury Leno's in thirty seconds to Mars the name of the sun the plays on the radio I hate that I'm even mentioning this and the sun so we're trying to get political and may go\nThe right you know\nNo I'm not going to sing it but just the very fact that they describe people on the right as being the far right and then the left of you know it's not the far right there is a small group of people that are in the far right but most of us are just the right\nYeah it really seems like there's a lot more people in the far left if we want to play that game because I mean we watch people basically robbing their faces on the tours of the Supreme\nCourt [laughter] haven't off I mean like what was that they look for like you know\nAre gone the apocalypse or where they're trying to Rob like there's a live human in that building like come on like you don't\nSee that as long as I write like there's like twelve\nAnd a sweat the country naked numbered by five million people anytime they say hey we might show up somewhere male and that's what everybody's like oh my God everybody on the right it's a Nazi in a hater they're picketing and blah blah and whatever phobic here and come up with to this point but you're listening to this rhetoric\nComing from leadership like back in waters in your clothes and Cory Booker that saying hey we need to harass these people they're not allowed to be comfortable lives\nDon't let them sleep I mean this is getting crazy\nYeah and it it is getting crazy and you're right about that I don't see people from the right marching through the streets the way they have any cheaper rallies looks weird thing here in Houston a couple of days ago where a guy was walking around ripping up Ted Cruz signs on camera you don't see people doing that with ... will be the point\nBy the way that was in front of a black hole coffee where I went after the show when I was in Houston and it's a bunch of like\nThe people who go to black hole copy all looked like that guy that was ripping up those signs\nSo that's I don't even know if that video is real or it was kind of like staged by this guy 'cause I mean it just seems like he got up from his his little ... whatever craft beer go\nI Believe that a good teacher has the feel set to be able to reach people through\nLevels of words that are completely different from one comment on that is\n[noise] [noise] we know you're out there\nHiding in plain sight living a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grain there's a better way a better life at lifestyles unlimited it's time to live their life you deserve\nYou can only do that by creating passive income led a show you how it's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com at lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n[noise]\nBack now here's some more conventional wisdom to set you free the man on a mission to retire America One person at a guy\nWelcome back to the last segment Adele wants the radio show if you'd like to call and ask a question of this last segment our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven [noise] um just sat next segment here I Want to share something with you I thought was rather interesting I found an article\nA that was stating that\nIt costs more to rent that it does cost more to own that it does to read in every state in the union every city in the union everywhere and the reason why I thought that the article made sense to bring the brain view is because people always ask me what do you think the market to speak\nAnd you know the answer\nYou can look at data in and making predictions that it might be picked or might not be but I can tell you this as long as it's cheaper to read than it is to own\nInvestors are going to continue to buy\nAnd as they continue to buy rentals they're going to drive the price up and they're going to make lots and lots of money doing it they're also going to have lots of positive casual so I was looking at this if somebody has to buy living you know by housing\nWhat would they be willing to pay to go from renting a place to owning a comparable piece of housing and it really blew my mind when I look\nThese numbers so the ... is the key takeaways according to the article and then I'll come back we'll speak more specifically about the markets rent\nIt says owning is more expensive everywhere access to all fifty ... days including watch to see it costs more each month to own a home than to rent the median costs people pay nationwide own a home is fifty four percent more than the median cost or to rent one\nThe smallest differences still third is still a third more to old state where the premium to own a home is the lowest is Florida\nWhere it costs a meeting of thirty three percent more to own the direct the states with the next lowest premiums are Colorado forty percent in Arizona forty one percent so you can see why you know it wouldn't make sense for people even in these areas where you would think they could get housing\nYou know cheaper\nRight then they can't other places it still costs you at least thirty to forty percent more to own a house\nIt goes on and says in some states it costs voting is far eclipses across reading in New Jersey state with the highest ownership premium the median monthly cost of owning is nearly double that of renting Ninety three percent more to own\nThat it is to read this is just an unbelievable situation Ninety three percent more so it looks to me that there is no time soon that people are going to stop renting when you can go live for half the price\nOr fifty percent less than why would you want to take the risk of buying a house looks like we have a caller on the line Tom is this need Tom Ziegler\nHello anybody out there ... okay\nThought to have somebody like that so let's go back to this let's look at the area's local areas here a first local area\nA is Texas it cost fifty six percent more to own in Texas than direct flowed is the lowest are only thirty three percent premium in Arizona is forty one the second lowest Georgia is the third lowest\nMichigan is fifty two per se and a California sixty two percent\nSixty two percent there so it looks like a people are going to be renting for some time in the future it appears at this point uh looks like there's phone lines lit up here is there anybody on the phone\n...\nOdd lost connection with my engineer it looks like All right so moving on\nLast thing I Want to cover here today is this when you're looking at retiring what you're thinking most of the times how can I save up enough money to be able to retire that's the concept right\nBut the reality is that what you really should be looking at is how can I learned to replace my earned income\nSo that if I Do lose my job if I Do retire my financial situation does it get worse it gets better\nThat's the whole goal behind what we do is not to create a big pile of money although many of us do\nBut the idea is to replace our earned income we passive income that's the whole game\nAnd that's what we're trying to teach you how to do need to get one of our free workshops you need to get to our website Go to the lifestyles are limited dot com and figure out what it is that you're going to need to do ... to start taking steps\nYou know there's an old saying how do you do not even one bite at a time and that's really what we're trying to teach you how do you start taking the

like so many antifa oppose or want to be mean to pose a wreath legitimately trying to keep a and I think that I think most people listening understand what Dave's asking about\nThis is the guy who is ramping up Ted Cruz yard signs to somebody\nAnd they sent me this guy's social media account information about him what he does for a living [noise] um information about his ah his background is education where he's been where he's grown up I Know everything about the guy I've got photos of him so I contact the police of the information that I have ... as a journalist and a reporter here KPMG I Can't go public\nI cannot it it it's kind of reckless just posted online yeah I had a conversation with management about it\nAnd so I contacted the police about it and I'm not sure that there's a police report\nThat was filed against this guy I think it's just a video that went viral and somebody who made the video was like wow they ripped up my yard signs I don't know what to do about that um but I don't know there could be more to this ... ... it's an HPD's hands now hopefully they do the right thing but hey since you asked what do you think about that\nWell you know the thing is for me it's like I I've got some friends on Facebook we're talking about this in ... in the state of the ... and they're just the invader signs everywhere they're not seen a lot of Ted Cruz sign\nWhy and why do you think that is that it will be [laughter] if it wasn't an object a threat I don't want a science\nPulled out of the yard or or worse I mean during the Trump campaign there were people actually driving your ... yard\nRun by the over you know\nThat's exactly right David nailed it people don't want someone to smear feces on their front door or to follow their daughter to school\nPeople don't this is what they do I have a whole file here this is first friday so I haven't been playing a lot of sound bites the show\nBut I have a whole folder here of soundbites this week of high ranking liberal thought leaders either encouraging violence against a conservatives are actually doing it one of them was comedian George Lopez attacking a Trump supporter at a ... at a at a Hooters\nNancy Pelosi calling for collateral damage against conservatives I'm Tim Kaine telling people to fight in the streets we all remember wouldn't Maxine Waters said and don't forget Louis Farrakhan comparing Jews to term I think this is par for the course for left us right now so Dave is absolutely right about that this is the reason why you don't see more of that people don't want\nTo somebody to smear duty all over their front door or go or or violently assault their wife or she's unloading groceries\nAnd we don't even want to be bothered when we're walking around the neighborhood\nI Am a pretty staunch libertarian there's a reason why I've defended Donald Trump over the last two years and stuff like this you get you get it right Dave\nAbsolutely I mean it's like it seems like there are there fighting what they perceived to be fascism with actual fascism\nNailed it day by day if you want to go to ... to buzz fast I Would love to go to but then\nWhen you're going what you're going a critical you get his information thank you very much Chris little very awesome producer ... the next producer Cathy and I'm not in the best and worst way possible over over here over here to Alan on the north west side quick call go ahead sir\nI you know that they were doing good man how about you I imagine a beautiful day in the neighborhood best day\nYeah uh yeah I was talking about a third of immigrants that ...\nThe thousands of people marching up from Honduras okay yes I don't know how true it is a heard some article I read somewhere that they crashed a barricade and actually a between Mexico to get to keep marching north yeah that's what\nRecording that's the charges reporting so here's some stuff that's not true about it first of all it is true it's four thousand people strong they tend to be coming from Guatemala and Honduras\nI talked to I talked to experts on border security all the time both on and off the air one of the people I speak to his brain and Durbin\nBringing explain this to me last night on the phone we we're kicking it and just hang up just talking on the phone like we ought to do is my body and he was explaining to me\nAll right so these caravans are not uncommon part of the reason why this kind of an is getting so much attention is because it's four thousand people you may hear or read something on line about how it's funded by George Soros I've even speculated that simply because that's something I've heard other people say and I was curious if it was true Brennan says there's no evidence to suggest that\nAh that being said it's still problematic um this is still bothers some if this results in us cutting off foreign aid to Central American countries\nThere'll be a Soviet bravo I'm totally fine with that here's something that's not true about it Allen you may have heard that nearby the Caribbean there was a hundred ISIS fighters\nNot true that is fake news it was reported on by a tabloid newspaper in Guatemala and it was ... just hated it was originally that they had that they were aware of a hundred ISIS people affiliated with ISIS and somehow this made it to Tom fighting of judicial watch and I have nothing against Tom fighting he does some great work\nBut he reported on this and I don't think it's true and neither does anybody else there is no evidence to suggest that is true\nThis tabloid and Guatemala reported that this was something that the president of Guatemala to Mike Pence\nOff the record in somebody overheard it but nobody can confirm if that's true and there's no documents knowing", "year": "2018",
