locally owned and operated southern front dot com over ten thousand door styles to choose from about a hundred fifty doors on display in the showroom open Monday through Saturday\nYou got to refer to me that America's\nFrom Asian votes hours away I'm track hello hand Fox News the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee judge ... capital now seems assured since for previously undecided senators have announced their intentions\nAnd then based on the words of one person um I think that's a very dangerous precedent I think that our tendency as a nation to wait for evidence when when when when accusations of rape come out I\nThink that those tendencies we currently have to wait I think that comes a lot from the civil rights movement\nAnd from the Jim Crow era where so many young black men were accused of rape by white women and\nUltimately that's what got them Lynch just if if they were trying to vote or being up but he according to the white racist\nThen um you know they would just say that he raped her white woman or white women would say it and they would have they would just let him and so we as a nation or because we got away for be racist and having that type of system we began to expect more evidence in these cases and not just\nHang people because because uh ... vigilantes because someone was accused well now you see once again just what happened with white feminism in the sixties and seventies you see at once again we're we're largely white feminists\nAre are um basically saying hey to hell with the civil rights both to hell with with uh how the impact young black men we're going to do what we want to do politically\nAnd that's really what's happening here and I ... and it it's very scary to me but I'm also encouraged because a lot of people stood up against it and I think that's great I think the best thing that could happen for this\nCountry is as for the statement that you can't do that to people every time you disagree with someone just accused him of something and then destroy the dog pile them and pick their lives apart and I saw in New York Times article the other day that said um you know Kevin off for ISIS someone at a bar with\nA guy that is that it was very easily forty yeah it was after you'd be forty touch [laughter] right\nRight okay so okay well ... that's my point and and so you know one of them uh MSNBC contributor a producer was tweeting out how a Kavanaugh once held a ... a a\nLot up on a a a keg above his head\nThat victory that they finished off the Catholic and I'm like\nYou know what the point that this is you know when you start breaking down they tried to dog pile on with accusers when you start break it down the accusers is like okay the last one not credible yeah that was really not credible not even actually accusing but anything that the first one\nAt this point I'm going to say she's not credible at all and what it what it looks like is that she and a former FBI agent and a few others this is that parents asked is that they got together and and and tried to unseat a sitting Supreme Court justice I mean like let's be honest when Romney said hey I'm\nIf I'm elected I'm going to appoint Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court I'm going to nominate brick oven out of the Supreme Court excuse me I'm data when it's Ford went to a therapist and didn't name\nWho's a powerful

did\nGreat Britain and you were making an interesting point there about cabin on I I just want you to finish that bond and then we got some people here in this Facebook Live feed that we're doing who are asking questions that they want me to relate to use so once you finish up your your thoughts on Kavanaugh and then I'll get to some of these questions\nWhy just take it you look at what for did what the the\nThe initial accuser what she did and what she claimed is like what Romney almost got elected are that if I'm elected I'm going to play Kavanaugh she went to a therapist allegedly and said that someone powerful and he had raped her so\nIs she is an activist trying to stop the Supreme Court nomination nominate nominee ah\nShe just wrote herself a blank check in two thousand twelve right she wrote herself a blank check so she would have some verification even though she never mentioned it to us so\nFor decades prior um I I just look at it and I don't think it's credible and and not only do I not that gets credible um I I find a way that us media outlets have largely handled it to be even less credible I find it to be anyone at this point is going to\nFail Breitbart your activists in your your accent you're you're just trying to support right wing but I just shut up\nBut not because like what we saw with mainstream media outlets\nFrom the New York times to MSNBC to
