Obama did keep that one promise about Obamacare and that's not in that\nTo be fair fair's fair Steve that's the one thing the GOP didn't get rid of which is frustrating but maybe after the midterms that put that went up or vote again would you like to see that happen\nWell heck yeah me too dude let's hope it does happen hey great call thanks so much for calling in Steve everybody ready to go on with you\nI'm with it Steve says if you're going to the Trump rally on Monday bring a magic wand and it should be easy to get it actually he's got a great idea because there's just pop up Halloween shops all over the city and if anybody wants to get a magic wand I bet you could find that prop sheep at Halloween store you know what I'm saying\nIf there was a marine up all of what magic wands that it would be unique\nSteve I Hope this idea spreads like wildfire I I have a humble and modest audience size but I Know that they're paying attention so that thousands of people have definitely been injected with your idea\nOkay cheers rather hang\nShow I put ... great thanks for you\nSteve I Hope you're right about that\nUm and clearly the people who get in line for the tickets are being given out first come first served that people get in line first people get into the building first are going to be the ones who are getting inside for the event uh there are clearly not forty thousand seats inside so there is going to be a limited as to how they do get in\nSharing okay hum so that'd be inside ... is is it a possibility but you think that most people to get a ticket or going to get in or do you think this guy should be disappointed like how how how should we answer that guy's question just bottom line\nWell bottom line is that the configuration of the arena is gonna is going to decide how things are laid out um I think people take make preparations to get in line and get inside as quickly as they possibly can they'll have\nA better opportunity to be able to see it live I'm clearly there's going to be an issue where people who have tickets and they show up with posters are banners they may have some issues getting inside as well because those are not permitted but if you get in line early and you have your ticket while in hand and you're ready to you ready to go inside you shouldn't have a problem\nOkay great quite a great answer okay I think it's I think you pretty much sum it up a why have you on the line you mind if I pick her brain about one more thing sure All right so this is why the video if you're just tuning in he's the communications director for the Harris County GOP flat ah I'm guessing you saw the debate last night between ten and beta right\nAbsolutely we had watch party here at the headquarters in at our satellite offices across Harris County\nOkay we we only got ... we don't have a ton of time but I'd love to just hear your your quick thoughts any immediate reaction to the debate\nA it's a it's a no contest that it's a clear blow up by Ted Cruz a book that looked completely flustered he had no answers he wasn't able to land a punch it was basically a heavyweight versus the fly weight and um it it's it's a clear win for team cruise\nDo you think that he's really running for president in two years and this isn't about the Texas Senate seat at all\nI I wouldn't be surprised at all I think Democrats are scrambling to find anyone that can can gain traction against President Trump and the Republican agenda\nUh Beto is a attractive candidate who looks nice on TV and says all the right things in New York and in California but bottom line that he doesn't work for the rest of America and he fails every single time he's ever tried to do anything so this is clear to him positioning itself to make a lucrative career after he's out of Congress\nRight on great answers ... hey I'm Glad to video calling in right now from the Harris County GOP use their communications director\nThose who want to attend the Trump rally should register for entry on the official Trump\nCampaign website there's gonna be parking on the energy side slated to be a Fifteen dollars per car\nSo car pool if you can take over no one's going to be using those

the only one criticizing the electoral college Hillary did it to Hillary was writing in the Atlantic recently she said you will be surprised to hear that I passionately believe it's time to abolish the other ...\nLike okay so let's say we subjected pre presidential elections to the popular vote that might sound fair to some Americans who have a misunderstanding of how the system works but calling to eliminate the electoral college\nThat that's absolutely an assault on your personal liberties and freedoms Americans do you remember who founded the Russian Communist Party it was a guy named Vladimir Lenin he said\nYeah give me ... used to teach the children in the sea die of sewn would never be uprooted education is a weapon was affected depends on the world's demands and whom ... aimed\nMy uh Vladimir Lenin kind of sounds like my Islamic terror boys I Do I Do I send for like an Eastern European like in Afghanistan ... voice sometimes people think I'm doing a Russian guy but they have similar accents in Turkmenistan in Afghanistan to did you know that\nAnyway a lot of Americans or miss educated on how democracy works or what is democracy they think America is a democracy you it's not\nThe word democracy appears nowhere in the two most important documents for our country which documents to think of talking about document number one declaration of independence\nBoom\nDocument number two in the constitution double boom boom boom actually\nOur constitution an article for section for guarantees every state in this union a Republican form of government\nA republic beat the leaders in a republic are democratically elected but that doesn't mean that it's a democracy\nActually the people that started this country hated democracy James Madison do you remember that federalist paper you know that is federal paper number ten\nHe said the pure democracy is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or an noxious individual\nI mean if you don't understand why democracy can be problematic consider this\nGang rape is a conclusion that was reached using a form of democracy you got six people together five of them wanted to do some rape in one of them did not want to get raped guess who wins the debate\nAt the Seventeen eighty seven constitutional convention Virginia governor Edmund Randolph had something very interesting to say he said in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found out\nIn the turbulence and Follies of democracy James Adam John Adams once wrote remember democracy never lasts long it soon waste exhausted murders itself there never was a democracy yet but did not commit suicide boom\nWould be just one comment I don't know\nWe know you're out there\nHiding in plain sight living a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grave there's a better way a better life and lifestyles unlimited it's time to live the life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income let a show you how\nIt's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mindless night in front of the TV\nGo to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop\nWhich one\n\nWe're back with the Dell wants a radio show this is Len marrow was successful real estate investor and lifestyles unlimited single family mentor Laurie fond to know and today we've been working on your financial freedom during our conversation about creating wealth and passive income\nThrough real estate investing which allows you to live where you want and invest where you want to invest where it makes sense so lord we've come to the end of the hour and I knew we could go on forever about this but can you give us some some final thoughts on this for people who are\nYou know either they're real estate investors and they need to find a better way because they're either like you said at the beginning of the show there\nThey're focused on appreciation instead of focusing on the fundamentals of the real estate investment business that requires cash flow or they're thinking about getting started because what they're doing right now does it work and they see the need for a change\nYeah well one of\nThe one of the things I Would recommend is of course in the in the last like that I mentioned all they're doing the ... area and the property that you can Google lots of things and do research on that whole\nBut this isn't the low ... will uh endeavor and you need to have a team but one of the most important things I Would think that you really need to have it as a mentor\nSomeone that you can actually physically you only books you can read or write articles you can do all the reports she walked in the wall but it last year talking live and asking questions because many times do you ask a question to real life person who's been there done that followed the model that fully\nThey time she'll ask one question they'll have three or four answers or ... ... followed so I I think it's really important to get plugged in someone who has been been successful at the end up over\nThere again they'll hold you accountable when you go off track and they'll also save your money by mistake and they'll all they'll make money by following the model so you know many times I Know with lifestyle we talk about a millionaire like that in in a versus a\nMiddle class or or working employee mentality and one of the thing is is that we don't spend time learning from other people out there and find someone\nWho's already been successful at it don't reinvent the wheel and follow that model ... take care of many of them like in in the meantime the really when you got a good mentor you're taking care of them and following that\nThat's that's really good insight worry because there's a whole [noise] I don't know how I I Want to call it a cult but there's a whole cult that's grown up around\nIdea of make as many mistakes as possible as rapidly as possible so you can get to the success on the other side and the issue with that is that our resources are limited\nAnd one of the most important resources we have is time our time is limited for most of us where you know in our forties or fifties or even sixties or seventies and and we haven't secure to retire\nAnd yet at some summer younger we have never to come in and in their thirties and they get set up perfectly for retirement and by the time they're in their late thirties they're\nThey're doing their world travels and and um and he's going to pick the kids up from school every day and and they really are stepping into the lifestyle that had their parents could only dream of\nBut for for many of us we are looking at what we have done and like wow you know I've been successful by every measure of the world I've been successful in my career I've been successful in my life\nAnd yet I Am not prepared to have their retirement that I Want and so they they have to look at change they have to look at\nBeing responsible for that and so do you really want to look at it than\nJust going out there and trying things to see if they work when the clock is ticking away and your money is taking away so that that's how I look at what\nAnd what defines success we talk about being successful at our career successful and work like that but it's all about ... people are we actually living the life that we want to live we might have a milestone in that mile marker is accomplishing something\nBut they didn't get a result we want what we really focused on and when you've got the ... but then it allows you to go ... go out there and do the things in life they want to do it so it's not about earning more money\nIt's about living the life what an earlier time to do that\nYou're absolutely right time as a limited resource\nAnd if we spend all our time learning what doesn't work will we ever get around to learning what does and we light but it could take years to do I do go out and find a model that's what I Do fortunate that I had mentors and that's why I Love that people I Know\nIs because someone gave all the power and I want to share that with other people\n[noise] yeah it it really does it that thankful that really does inspire you to just turn around and how many people as you can and and it's ... living the life that is that creates the satisfaction\nOr the other thing that many of us have done is is we followed we followed the map that that friends or family established for us when we were young we wanted to make them proud of us we figure they know what's best for us and then as\nWe get older we realized that we followed them pass it really weren't our pets there was somebody else's path and they have that led to our own happiness and\nI I I think you and I both stand as examples of hope for turning that around\nAnd you you follow what\nYou do the best that you can with the resources that you can and what we're saying is there's other resources out there there's people who will share and will help\nAnd they will will help you to do this we you know we are\nSingle family an apartment community by and hold investors and if that's what you want to do and the things that you've heard dealt talk about talk about life talk about real estate and that's the path that you want to follow then you should you should follow people who have successfully done that\nAnd that's the metro that you're looking for whatever you want to do in life find somebody who was done it the way you want to do it and been successful and who's willing now\nBecause they're grateful for what they have to turn back and pass and that back to you\n[noise] Lorrie thank you so much for joining me
