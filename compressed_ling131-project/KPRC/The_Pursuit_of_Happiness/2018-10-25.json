the information's out their Twitter can kind of can try to suppress that guy's wife\nI don't know if it's credible or not um I don't know how to feel about that but\nAnyway calls are coming in and I want to know what you all think that part of the rally are coming up and just a little bit Brock Obama eating his own words explained why coming up in the meantime give us a call Seventy one three she went to five nine fifty you know like the station nine fifty seven when three two one two five nine five zero if you want to weigh in on this\nCabin in shadow view what's up Gavin you were at the rally yesterday you called us yesterday right\nServe so you finally got it and you called us from the line it was chaotic it was crazy out there are people were excited it it was kind of like going to a Leonard Skinner concert back in the seventies you finally got to you but\nNobody was drunk so great I mean a few people were probably drawn don't you're going to see some bears and the ...\nYeah there was definitely a few people were trying to get a few bruise but they weren't getting stupid drunk they were it was we spend the whole drunk you know there's there's happy drunk angry drunk respectful drunk and then like Saturn depressed drunk and I had two of those work well for me a ... to ... what what did you think man any takeaway what were the highs and lows any reaction to it\nSo I Would say the highs and lows where you literally is law and micro tells them what Houston\nI saw young I'm I'm a I'm saying like teenage black kids out there I saw Asian families out there are so proud burger recon stop you know more Hispanics than the left wing ... ever admit to\nOh you're you're not kidding Gavin there was there were lots of black people watching Hispanic people there was a whole group they're called Latinos for Trump there was there was Muslims for Trump did you see that I did it\nDid not expect to see that algae be cheaper Trump we've seen that before I mean Peter the wheel and my last novel as we know those guys are out there but but you you can't look at someone to know that they're gay so it's interesting when they put the shirt on and then it's like oh okay\nOh they're worse than on his new editor that's on them to do something\nWrong with it but they were going to be able to you know hey man joined the party\nYeah there's there's there's nothing wrong with that hey you know what part of the ... the reason why you see that and I'll Gavin is there's probably gay people who have been Democrats their whole life and then as soon as that Supreme Court ruling came out a few years back they thought\nWell that's it I was a one issue guy it's time for me to reevaluate this political party and after they did it they thought after the gay marriage thing I don't really know what else I got going for me over here I'm I guess I'm not a Democrat after all\nRight let me just say one quick thing\nI'm the only thing I had an issue with Trump's speech he didn't do any respect for the cage and\nOh I\nDon't I don't care for Kevin Brady otherwise she needed to give props to the people you know just the normal civilians who cared enough to come from out of town to help out those working\n... great great observation and gab and you know part of the reason why that is true is I mean you think even remember Hurricane Harvey they came here after Hurricane Harvey they praised the Cajun Navy at the state of the union address earlier this year certainly he's aware of it\nBut I think some people ... especially on the upper the middle east coast over there or Washington DC they probably think of the Cajun Navy as a New Orleans thing they're forgetting that\nThere's a lot of cages and Houston manage just drive around the city it's not hard to find a crawfish man\nOh are you Cajun molesting seven oh\nI should have figured that out I mean of course it's a French name again and I got a question for you man this is this is something that's weighed heavily on my mind I mean this is something that's really I've been I've stayed up late at night wondering this\nWhy is it\nThat when you're eating crawfish in Houston you get that orange stuff on your fingers but when you go to New Orleans that doesn't happen [noise]\nYou know\nYou cited I like going what don't you liked about driving in Louisiana is at the speed traps\n... well that and also it's just so especially when you're going through a ... I was caught red stick I Can't think of Baton Rouge we go through Baton Rouge has just always so backed up there but now you\nIt was even you you said it may in Baton Rouge has kind of like a little bit New Orleans a little bit Houston\nIt's inland a little bit it kind of reminds me of a cross between both cities um but you're right it it expanded too quickly Baton Rouge grew faster than the than the local government was able to deal with the infrastructure they don't have enough roads hostage kind of like that too I guess I'm speaking the obvious here you know\nYeah it's really that bridge right there in Baton Rouge religious gives you two lanes on each side and it just it's just such a bottleneck and then the the entered change go to it and everything are just so crazy but like you said it just was never designed for a traffic ... now\nYou have something happen there's going to always nightmare out driving back from Florida a couple of weeks ago I stopped in the Exxon station they're broke the bridge and got myself a gas station or some ...\n... you said he's absolutely right about that you know people always tell jokes about I don't eat the gas station sushi or whatever I\nI've never seen gas station sushi before but I have seen good food at Louisiana gas station I don't know it's just something about Louisiana Man I think it's some of the best food on earth and I say that as a person who enthusiastically moved to Texas many years ago specifically for the food well put food was certainly part of it you know you just gave me a great idea though Peter I know there's\nProbably wasn't your intention but I figured out how we could simultaneously solved two problems at once I'm I'm\nA I'm a two birds one stone kind of guy you got a problem in Austin with liberalism agree or disagree\nAgree he got a problem in Austin with traffic agree or disagree agree All right so here's what we do get back to the roots for now on if you want to travel around Austin it should be legal to drive a car you can only go around town on horseback\nIn truth Texas tradition I'm Talking about what should the punishment I don't think there's a punishment for Coney enough\nFor I mean because after all climate change and the global warming they're gonna have to accept this ... if we go to Austin city council and proposes a ridiculous law like that they're gonna have to listen to us simply if we start the conversation with well you know climate change global warming\nA you know your your your previous isn't enough everyone has to ride a horse for now on or you're destroying the environment and just like clockwork all the liberals or move up to Dallas what do you think Peter\nI like that yet I really liked to be able to get off and back\nBut you know I'm an idea guy that's what I did go on an ideal person I Do enjoy the food and the music in Austin but oh God the politics did you hear that one recently we talked about this on the show it's now illegal for restaurants in Austin to throw away food you either have to recycle it or use a compost heap\nI Know about compost eats my uncle Steve's got went up at Fort Worth he's ... he's one man living on a large property compost heap works great for him now imagine you have hundreds of people that your restaurant all day you have to do something with all that food Austin is going to stink\nKnow that the thing about the rats and everything you're going to have\nYeah you said it Peter hey man good called brother was ... what were you call it about Cajun food was or something you wanted to say about that I covered it all thank you\nI think you've nailed it Peter good call anybody wants to get in on the seven when three two one two five nine five zero you know we got to talk of to write are talking about right now there are two Castro brothers one of 'em went away to run me a\nHousing and urban development but the job the Ben Carson currently has nobody ever talks about that part of the reason why is I think Ben's doing an okay job but the other reason why is there were so many problems when when the Castro's were in charge of housing and urban development Julian Castro specifically that now that someone else who's running it we just don't hear about much about it anymore\nWhen Julian Julian pretty stupid but boy if his brother didn't didn't say hey here hold my beer I'm going out dumb you this is a straight up coast to coast George Norris stuff watching Castro is on CNN the other day and he makes a pretty outrageous claims\nHe says that Jared Kushner you know Jerry ... you know that Jared Kushner he's that nice I like daddy Blanca tribes has been that Jeremy ... is a bad night's boy with Jared Kushner\nHe's been talking to the Saudis about what to do about this ... they found by the way they found a body parts of his today in some garden or something isn't that creepy\nAnd this is just a regular day in Saudi Arabia we could pretend like this is ... ... this is shocking news it's not people journalists get murdered in Saudi Arabia just like they get murdered in Mexico people could be headed in the streets in Saudi Arabia\nThis thing with your market shaggy it's sad and it's scary but this is the tip of the iceberg for what happens in the Saudi king them anyway\nSo walking Castro's on CNN and he makes this far fetched claim as he's making this claim\nThe CNN anchor poppy Harlow stops them and goes I didn't know that we haven't heard that walking Castro claims that Jared Kushner put out a hit on your mark a shot and killed\nBefore we go out with like your take on the apparent murder and there are no ... Republican Senator Bob Corker chairs the Senate Foreign relations and he said that he is being locked\nUp I think the key intelligence so is that there's going to clamp down on further intelligence I take the Senate or in the White House responding thing look at not from I I I Know that you're not in fashion right now and you haven't had a camera with me if I'm wrong to say that I can tell it and talking about but what is your reaction to that concern\nFrom getting ready public and get ready zero to ... to ... I Know poppy\nThat there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list to the crown prince to NBS why ... and that the president may have acted on that one one of the people that he took action against Mr ... soldiers\nThat we have I just find it there for me or we do not have that reporting and I will not recording to that effect or not I know there has been reporting back a long and short\nAs you heard in the investigation you saw me on social media from some from somebody I think progress dot org there's no reporting on that even see I wouldn't take the bait it occurred to me though is he's making this absurd claim we should add the X. files music\nWhat their reaction to that concern from the Republican counterpart\nOh I'm I I Know that there's been a lot of discussion about this will be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today [noise] let me get to the point that I think is most disturbing right now\nThe reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list to the crown prince to NBS in Saudi Arabia\nThat may have acted on that one of the people he took action against\nMr Congress to find me there for the or we do not have that were born and not know where you're getting having been reporting\nBy goodbye Castro goodbye already bought the longest shorter than you [laughter]\nYou're listening bugs I Love all the\n... the\nThing is\nYour way\nThrough ruined the little Supreme Court party among other things during a lot of parties they didn't yeah they didn't get to follow up with Hillary's nomination for SCOTUS and that's just one of the\nThings that you voting for Trump did and that's why they're out to undo every single vote the laws on the cabin all\nGot nothing against him personally it's against you know they're out to get you who's out for Yahoo's with ya who's on your side you're looking at him and strike the men of the people you're W.

congressional representative of that is what Maxine Waters represents right\nSo she seems to think and get ready for those folks\nShe seems to think that Donald Trump is encouraging violence\nLet me rephrase that in different words after calling for violence Maxine Waters is accusing Trump of calling for violence irony level palpable I mean are you serious right now and he gave me a break earlier this year it was a factor was back in June twenty eighth team representative Maxine Waters was famous for saying this right here\nOf course the lives of president says that\nAll of his constituents I'll just\nThreaten his constituents is supportive I Know that\nAll the time that I Do at that\nTime okay so it actually was not the ... that was her talking about how she didn't threaten anybody that said she didn't threaten anyone All right so there she was saying that she didn't encourage violence right well I I think that I think that she actually did encourage violence um she she's she's done it more than once if I'm not mistaken but here's the soundbite I think I was actually looking\nFor that's what I say we show\nAnd I guess only station\nIf you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant she's talking about Republicans ... conservatives at a department store at a gas station in a public place you get out you create a crowd a crowd what's another river crowd anybody\n... mob mob would\nBe a word for word I Would use right\nYou get out and you create a mob you push back on what do you think what does push back on I mean somebody's trying to eat dinner\nWith their wife push back on um what does that mean well I think it literally means use force folks I'm not trying to draw lines here where they don't exist this is representative Maxine Waters and this is our rhetoric rate I hate that word rhetoric wow that is what it is\nAh the crowd cheered everybody wanted to Republicans were going to be mean to them in public and their wives and their kids and their\nGrandma's who were just trying to eat ice cream or whatever it is they're doing at the time right everybody liked it it was a short time later that aggressive progressive\nMob started to form around the country intimidating lawmakers in public places not just lawmakers you know\nAll kinds of people what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders and\nWe we all know what happened in ... before that it was even worse remember when Steve ... got shot remember when Rand Paul got tackled than they broke six of his ribs there have been other incidents this is these are isolated things that's happened a lot it happened to Lindsey Graham that happened to Jeff Flake although he's not necessarily on our side the mob certainly came from Jeff Flake right now\nBoy this lady ... I don't think anybody has a cell phone aware as Maxine Waters is after encouraging violence against Republicans Maxine Waters is now suggesting that Donald Trump is the one who's encouraging violence or we haven't power issues which has happened did all the electricity gardener that was so weird right\nNo everybody my headphones that doesn't matter anyway here's Maxine Waters saying that Trump is encouraging violence\nThe president of the United states\nShould take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're saying oh for the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states has been dog whistling to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there\nI think that the president on there and I had been dog with some folks at Maxine Waters this dog was selling a Donald Trump is dog whistling than what is Maxine Waters doing Maxine Waters is on a megaphone\nTelling people literally automated phone standing on a stage telling the crowd to be violent now Donald Trump's doing Donald Trump\nYou know with all these these these bomb reports today and part of the reason why I didn't start my show today with that is because you're hearing about that everywhere it's I I have Fox News on behind me they're talking about it right now that's all people are talking about today you don't need to hear me tell you that right well there's one sick\nPsychopath out there who who may be sending pipe bombs to somebody right it's a possibility that there's more than one person\nAnd that's about all we know about this we know nothing else about\nIt right the the bombs right there's bombs out there so that is scary but nobody has gotten hurt so that's good right\nI Am reluctant to say that this is somebody from a antifa or the alt right to really to say anything because we know almost nothing about the guy but that hasn't stopped people on the left from using mad bomber as\nJust as a hash tag but as a headline that's the topic of discussion now is oh who's the mega bomber alright folks let's let's get real here for a minute we don't know if this guy's the magnet bomber we have no idea what he is he could be with the left he couldn't be with ISIS remember after nine eleven did anybody say oh I Wonder I Wonder if it was the neo Nazis that flew a plane\nInto the world Trade Center no\nNobody said that that would be a pretty dumb thing to say considering especially what followed after that it's such a shame where we're at right now as a culture I mean\nYou always try to look at the silver lining in everything\nNine eleven was the biggest tragedy in American history it's hard to see that there was a silver lining in it but it did bring the country together at least for one brief fleeting moment I mean thousands of people's lives had to die and that certainly doesn't make it worth it but at least after that at least after that\nNeedless act of violence we as Americans said hey man we need to unify they don't want to unify under Trump the left isn't interested in unifying under Trump the left wants more division than ever they they they they hate us say hey you the hate liberty they have the constitution one of our listeners earlier today sent me this link\nTo Web results Web search results and I thought at first I thought why she sent me this and he did a Web search for Ted Cruz's website and the word constitutions what the word constitution appears on Ted Cruz's website a lot like over and over and over again\nI guess how many times it appears on ... or ...\nJust got gas well do you think twenty a dozen six one answer is no it appeared on at zero times exactly zilch zero not a single time they don't work\nNot a big fan of the constitution of course that all brings this conversation full circle earlier we were talking about Michael ... Michael ... wants to run for president he clearly does he's describing himself listen to this guy Michael ... past won't stop him from running and twenty twenty that's a headline right now", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "25"}
