life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to be terminated the grain there's a better way better life at lifestyles unlimited it's time to live their life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income let a show you how it's just two hours\nTo see breezy last seven days and you're on the caller long time and you were invited to join the conversation\nMade the Rio\nWe'll talk [laughter]\n[noise] we'll come back no here's some more money in your wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One for each month he will go\nBack to last segment do on the radio show today the concept is Ben that most of us that are not where we want to be in life in any specific barrier various a part of our lives um or not there because we started with the wrong base assumption in life and that\nHow you see the problem that your challenge with is really the problem itself and if you see the problem incorrectly or if you approach the problem with the wrong base assumption then you're not going to be able to fix or beat the problem\nAnd so we've got all over the place today we talked about fitness and finances and family and help that you know it it it's in every aspect of your life this is true\nSo what is the takeaway from this what should be done I think the first thing you need to do is you need to sit down today with yourself maybe with a family member of friends\nAnd ask yourself is basic question how do I approach life\nDo I approach everything I Do from the I wanted now type a instantaneously gratification diseased idea column and just strike out radically fast and hard on everything\nAnd not think through what the long term results or if I'm Taipei I probably don't have a life plan you probably can't find written down anywhere what my goals are in life\nI probably just going to change them by tomorrow anyway I'm if I'm that type of person that I wanted to realize that upfront and then I've got to think about ideas with that limitation your mind and figure out ways to keep yourself\nOn topic\nTo make yourself accountable for finishing the project\nMaybe even just cut down the number of projects that you take on in life whatever they be whether it's fitness finance family health whatever um\nBut you definitely have to see that that is your challenge now if you're type B personality you got to realize that you have no motivation at all in life\nYou want to take the easiest route through life that there is you want everything to stay the same and you don't want any challenges now in my personal life I'm a super type B person financially I'm a super type B personality and so it was very important for me\nTo find a spouse or that would be a Taipei\nThis keeps me you know centered in other words I Would never go out and do anything I'd live with a box under a bridge never go anywhere do anything\nBut my fiance she likes to go everywhere she wants to go out with people she likes groups of people and I'm not a group of people kind of guy I'm and just hang out with my girl kind of guy but she likes to go out get dressed up and go out with people and have fun and go out to eat different places and do different things she's always looking for something different to do\nAnd I'm always wanting to do the same things you know it's it's something that I had to just worried about myself that that's the way I was um\nYou know I've worked in health club\nFor twelve years the only job corporate job I really ever had did that my whole adult career\nI was in health clubs since I was a kid since I was fourteen years old at the workout new body building until I've competitive until I was thirty five sixty want us to work out a stick with it you know whatever it is I think's important in life I Do it do it do it do it again\n[noise] so what is it about type east it's challenging is they won't add anything new to their life they're afraid of taking risks they're very risque I'm\nAdverse or they don't like new projects where it takes a whole lot of effort to get that rock roll and\nUh and so you get like I said if you're being you need to find somebody can help you or to get over your views\nAnd if you're in a need to get somebody to help you get over your atheism and if you've got that person in your life you need to let them help you on those things and not get better because what you think they're doing is they're ... they're attacking your basic personality\nIs what they're doing in your mind that's what it is you're attacking my basic personality which means I don't like you know I Do like you I like your enough to want to help you and that's why when I can sit on the outside and know that everything you're telling me is wrong\nI if I like you have the responsibility to tell that to you and say look you're not seeing this quite right\nYou had the wrong base assumption about X Y Z and let's start with the base of something about yourself who do you think you are how are you approaching life and rare have your failures come from\n[noise] have you had eight different husbands eight different wives why maybe that part of your personality is to type age just go close your eyes run bank find somebody close rise run bang find somebody else falls apart\nYou know or you the kind of guy that met his girlfriend in high school and you've been with her and you're sixty years old been married for forty five years or something like that you know that's a different kind of relationship paradigm\nYou've got to know what yours is now that uh one paradigm you know to be like okay so it's good that we're together for forty five years right\nAnd I'm due to go over that paradigm and just to show you how that could be a bad paradigm because it sounds good on surface\nThe other one was the this has been wiped been married for twenty or Thirty years and the wife was really uncomfortable in the relationship as she took her husband ... pulled him into a psychiatrist's office a relationship their purpose whatever it was\nUntil the doctor look we've been married Twenty years he doesn't even told me he loves me anymore\nNever never ever ever tells me loves me or does it and using the actual like er shows proves that you love me and the doctor looked at the guy should which is true and we got to look to the doctor to doctor I told her Twenty years ago I loved her and I married her if anything changes uh let her know\nIn other words he's gotten so completion the relationship he brings up and do it\nAnd that my friends is how type B will lose the battle in everything they do they become so complex than what they're doing that they lose the church and then eventually they lose the battle so my friends looked at valuing first ourselves\nThe people around us our approach to life and then everything you\nDo whether it's finance business ... what about valuing our basic premise of base premise that were started if you do that you're going

for a drug and alcohol treatment centers that you trust and uses evidence based treatment\nSeven on three two one two five nine five oh if you want to get in on this my my producer sent me this video earlier\nWith Elizabeth Warren doing what looks like a town hall for a bunch of Democrats and basically it's Senator Elizabeth Warren admitting the Democrats' demand for this invest FBI investigation was just an opening to blocking judge Brett Kavanaugh for getting to the Supreme Court he never cared hours after this confirmation hours after\nThe nomination happen Bernie Sanders already came out and said we ought to do everything we can just stop Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed\nAnd at the time we knew nothing about Brett Kavanaugh except that he had spent years working in federal courts and he used to be Justice Kennedy's cork the same guy who is replacing it in the tournament strikingly similar policy positions again\nReplacing a moderate with a moderate earlier today the news broke while this this came out over the weekend but Trump basically gave free reign on the ah to the FBI on the cabinet investigation\nAnd there was some criticism over whether or not this was expansive and this is the FBI really giving us the investigation that we want\nAll right so the ... the White House has responded to that now the White House has reportedly preventing the FBI to interview anyone deemed appropriate and its investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh so they're expanding the already expanded investigation\nOh so what comes from this one has to ask that question right let's say hypothetically that the Democrats are calling for the FBI investigation don't find the smoking gun that they're waiting for\nAll right that goes out they knock on doors they make phone calls hey was was ... Kevin are really a virgin in college or did he lie about that now you don't know okay hey did Brett Kavanaugh ever get so drunk that he attacked somebody you know you don't know All right so they do all the research right and then they get to the point where they say\nAll right the FBI as concluded that we couldn't find any determinative you know a offended of evidence you know something something that would that would absolutely justify or warrant keeping them off the Supreme Court according to these allegations the smoking gun the thing the Democrats are waiting for\nThe Democrats then respond to that and go oh well I guess we were wrong about that we better better go ahead and could from Brett Kavanaugh\nI Know of course not that has nothing to do with it they're they're just pissed off about Neil Gorsuch there just pissed off about losing the election they're upset about so many things the book the blue wave is not coming and they know it so this is that this is all they've got right now they have to prove a small\nTo a small outspoken minority that they're willing to fight and they they do and they don't have anything to fight with they didn't bring any weapons to the brawl so instead of all they can deal with is hyperbole a sensationalism and and farfetched claims right anyway so now they're getting what they want here they're getting the FBI investigation that they asked for\nAnd interestingly enough I\nAs soon as this came out and they they first I Know it doesn't need to be a complicated investigation that really doesn't OK okay are you sure yeah yeah just a simple investigation we just want to know and the second the FBI investigation started\nThe Democrats change their tone I mean like that you could set your watch to it the minute it happened the Democrats came out and well the FBI is not investigating hard enough we needed expanse of investigation that needs to go on for months now we know that's what you want that's all you want it this whole time all you really care about is getting this to go until the midterms in November\nRight so they're going to get what they want probably I I'm beginning to think more and more every day that this passes\nThat this might actually make it to ... terms it's October now guys we all know an election day comes it's in early November the first week midterms are right around the corner I mean think about how quickly or how how short when a short time ago it was August\nIt's October now it's going to be November before you know it do you really think the Democrats don't have the patience to keep this up until November I kinda feel like they do anyway so Trump's giving them what they want and they're going to get it in the meantime for irony here that Dianne Feinstein of all the people was the one sounding the alarm on this Dianne Feinstein\nUpset that she wasn't getting an FBI investigation hey you old ... year old ... with your your turkey neck Banshee you had the possibility to get the FBI investigation way before anybody even knew about this she had the report she had the documents she had the letter for Christine Blasey Ford\nShe could've handed that over to the FBI then this investigation could have already been happening it wasn't there was no law enforcement involvement because of Dianne Feinstein and the fact that she stalled and delayed on is this is peak irony right here and I don't think that this lady sit on the report for months\nBut she's the same woman who had a Chinese spies working it's her personal driver for what was the decades that was going on for years how about an FBI investigation into that huh I'm curious what Dianne Feinstein is real connection to China looks like hey speaking of speaking of investigation somebody else's calling for an investigation now\nLindsey Graham Lindsey Graham on some investigation\nInto the Democrats now this is very interesting very specific group of Democrats the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats All right so what would they investigate well first of all it would be interesting to know if Christine Blasey Ford really is the uninvolved political that they claim or if in fact she she's an active liberal Democrat as the as the evidence seemed to suggest\nI've seen reports that she was that the women's march and I've\nSeen all kinds of things all kinds of claims made about this woman on the Internet which she's a Democrat donor in what's the real truth well an investigation would answer some of those questions um there was a photo going around on line of her with Hillary Clinton I don't know if that's real I don't necessarily believe that it is but\nUm but if anybody can correct me on that head give me a call them you know seven when three two one two five nine five oh I Would like to see an investigation into Dianne Feinstein wouldn't you with all the resources with all the money that we spend as taxpayers\nNot only for all these useless federal branches and agencies of of the government\nBut to pay the salaries of all these elitist establishment inside the beltway lawmakers wouldn't it be great if we could use our resources just do investigate them\nI Would have no problem with that instead of investigating I don't know if people pirated music on the Internet or whatever the FBI's busy doing lately people downloading illegal copies of Fort Night or whatever however we investigate that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "city": "Houston", "day": "01"}
