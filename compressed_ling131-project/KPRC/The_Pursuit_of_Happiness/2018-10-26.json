I could wake up on the other end which was actually kind of cool when I was flying a lot\nIt was really really helpful I was flying a lot not getting a chance to sleep regularly because of work and things of that nature so the fact that it helped me get a little bit of rest on planes these hypnosis apps I really liked and there was this one company ... uh she was mind defy mind if maybe that was a company that\nI haven't used them in a while but this was a company that I got 'em all from and they're all completely reliable but then I noticed when the company came out with a couple of new ones there was a twist at the end of a I guess it was meant to be healthy thing but they said hey and you know tonight\nTonight after you go to bed early in the morning after you've gotten all this really great sleep that you're going to get because you've got to sleep better as a person in general you're going to have venting dreams and\nDarned if they didn't change the quality of my dreams these hypnosis apps and I stopped listening to him because of venting dream I guess as maybe where you let go of a lot of stuff I don't know if this is a term that exists maybe you're a medical practitioner you know something about it maybe it was just something that the people at the hypnosis apps company came up with\nBut I work with a start going like oh my God [laughter]\nEvery single time I listen to one of these things is that I Would have vending dreams and I don't know it wasn't really something that I Would sign up for voluntarily so I might give the nightmare inducing Burger King sandwich\nThe big old ... you try to get back to me ... let me know how that works out for you [noise]\n[noise]\nA great way to get over break up according to doctors is to have sex with your ex yeah apparently the best way to get over someone after a break up is to get back on top of them and then perhaps underneath them and then side by side with them and maybe on top of him again for good measure because believe it or not according to a new study\nOut of Wayne State University in Detroit the doctors they're determined that one of the best way to get over your access by getting on with him one last\nThe researchers say that people who did that with ... after a break up were less likely to be depressed and felt better overall on a day to day basis why will they say that having that

ratings on Tuesday night at average ten point six million viewers\nAlthough that number might climb a bit wants TV aren't delayed viewing are factored in there a couple of ways to look at that on one hand it was exactly where Roseanne left off this past spring when ten point six million people watched the season finale on may twenty second but it was down from last season's premier\nWhich attracted sixteen point six Eighteen point four million viewers\nNow some might say that it's down because Roseanne bars and on the show any more\nBut it's hard to make the direct correlation because last season it was coming back after having been off the air for twenty Twenty one years and there's tremendous anticipation around it and this season it was coming back after being off the air for five months of the big question is now that the hype and curiosity factor has gone will the ratings settling\nAnd whatever that number is it'll be hard to say whether or not it would have been better with\nOr without Roseanne speaking of watching things and onto than viewing and all the above you here's a story I promise we get to for whatever reason people are tweeting about all the things

Chris of the band computer game and New York times best selling author AJ Jay Gould about how we are all family like it or not the way that\nI defined family is you know we are surrounded by people our lives that we consider cousins and close close loved ones that are closer to us\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWe are back our experience of telephone issues I Apologize folks right now we were going to have my buddy Brennan more song from red state but live radio doesn't always go the way that you want it to go so are you guys are calling and I apologize it sounds like our telephone system is running through a distortion pedal for a guitar\nSome of you a percentage of you will know exactly what I mean and the rest of you are probably thinking well what's wrong with that guitar sound cool All right well not when you're trying to run a vocal process or throw him it doesn't sound cool now there's something\nSomething very wrong with it right now hey you know other news though not to worry though there are other things there are other thing is happening but you're going to want to know about and uh yeah let me let me pull something up here right now\nUh so I think we all remember when this happened right this is the most self unaware person in politics or maybe she knows exactly what she's doing a Maxine Waters when I say the name Maxine Waters what are you immediately think of for representative Maxine Waters she doesn't live in her district\nAnd she's a lawmaker that's amazing right I mean I get it if you live right down the street or if you used to live there she doesn't live there at all if you've ever been and Maxine Waters district in in Los Angeles\nIt's kinda like you're driving through Skid Row it's nothing but syringes hanging out of people's arms uh junkies throwing feces at each other it's just the disgusting the worst place in LA that's\nWhere Maxine Waters is the lawmaker the congressional representative of that is what Maxine Waters represents right so she seems to think ... and get ready for this folks\nShe seems to think that Donald Trump is encouraging violence\nLet me rephrase that in different words after calling for violence Maxine Waters is accusing Trump of calling for violence irony level palpable I mean are you serious right now and he gave me a break earlier this year we factor was back in June twenty eighth team representative Maxine Waters was famous for saying this right here\nOf course the lives of president said that\nAll of his constituents out to\nThreaten his constituents is supportive I Do that\nAll the time but I didn't do at that\nTime okay so it actually was not the ... that was her talking about how she didn't threaten anybody that said she didn't threaten anyone All right so there she is saying that she didn't encourage violence right well I I think that I think that she actually did encourage violence um she she's she's done it more than once if I'm not mistaken but here's the soundbite I think I was actually looking\nFor that's what I say we show\nHave to show your\nAnd it has to lean in\nIf you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant you talking about Republican starting my conservatives at a department store at a gas station in a public place you get out you create a crowd a crowd what's another word for a crowd anybody\n... mob mob would\nBe a word for word I Would use right\nYou get on you create a mob you push back on what do you think what does push back on I mean somebody's trying to eat dinner\nWith their wife pushback on him what does that mean well I think it literally means use force folks I'm not trying to draw lines here where they don't exist this is representative Maxine Waters this is our rhetoric rate I hate that word rhetoric wow that's what it is\nAh the crowd cheered everybody wanted to and we're going to be made public and their wives and their kids and their\nGrandma's who were just trying to eat ice cream or whatever it is they're doing at the time right everybody liked it it was a short time later that aggressive progressive\nMob started to form around the country intimidating lawmakers in public places not just lawmakers you know\nAll kinds of people what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders and\nWe we all know what happened in ... before that it was even worse remember when Steve so we've got shot remember when Rand Paul got tackled and they broke six of his ribs there have been other incidents this has these aren't isolated things that's happened a lot it happened to Lindsey Graham it happened to Jeff Flake although he's not necessarily on our side the mob certainly came from Jeff Flake right now\nFor this lady I don't think anybody is a self underwear has Maxine\nWaters is after encouraging violence against Republicans Maxine Waters is now suggesting that Donald Trump is the one who's encouraging violence or we haven't power issues which has happened did all the electricity go out and there was so weird right no everybody my headphones that doesn't matter anyway here's Maxine Waters saying that Trump is encouraging violence\nThink the president of the United states\nShould take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're saying oh for the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states has been dog whistling\nWhat do you want to prove that he was more a native\nAmerican um and then uh [laughter] Elizabeth Warren or was that Lindsey Graham I don't know you had a funny line to anyway Chuck Grassley\nOn Thursday referred Julie sweat neck and her lawyer Michael having at each of the department of justice for a possible criminal investigation over allegations that they made false statements to Congress\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh lady ... that's the thing is I don't get to make up the facts I Wish I could I Wish I could make up the facts for you if I could make up the facts this would be a show like everybody in the country has got to get a\nFree ticket today in the mail for tacos no that's not what's happening lady this is this is awfully specific right like do you think do you think I even have a horse\nIn this race I'm not a Republican I don't care Brett Kavanaugh as a moderate if Brett Kavanaugh didn't get on to the Supreme Court we would have got Amy Cohen beret and she would have been better no really there's a part of me in the back of my head it bothers the crap out I mean it bothers the hell out of me that Democrats\nLeveled these false allegations of ... gets Brett Kavanaugh and that's the only reason why I defended him I'm not a Brett Kavanaugh Republican I don't care about defending Brett Kavanaugh lady oh bless your sweetheart oh Mickey I could count there are ... there are more letters in your first name\n[laughter] than there are two points for your brain because you're not a smart person Grassley is saying here's what Chuck Grassley said Chuck Grassley and I don't I've never been crazy about Chuck Grassley but he this was his doing if you don't like it lady moved to the state where he's from originally from South Dakota is that we're Chuck Grassley from he's from one of the Dakotas\nHe's really into corn and stuff like that um and and [laughter]\nHe has done a fantastic job of trying to get the truth out about what's going on right now uh excuse me Iowa that's what I meant to say not the Dakotas I'm Sorry about that I Want to give the wrong information on the air but I was wrong about he's from Iowa that's what I meant to say not the Dakotas so\nAnyway Chuck Grassley who's saying when a well meaning citizen comes forward information relevant to the committee's work I take it seriously\nIt takes courage to come forward it does I agree with him he continues especially with allegations of sexual misconduct are personal trauma here here Chuck Grassley is right about that I'm grateful for those who find that courage Grassley continued but in the heat of partisan moments\nSome do try to knowingly mislead the committee\nYeah like I don't like CPR for example creepy born lawyer yeah I think he did [laughter] I think he did Chuck Grassley continues that's unfair to my colleagues the nominees and others providing information who are seeking the truth yeah ... is a potential twenty twenty democratic for gradual connect candidate told\nCNN the place where I'm reading the story it's not a right wing news outlet it's CNN the communist news network oh Mickey Mickey as going nuts right now in the comic she's so angry defending herself what what\nYeah we'll get Chris Paul my Facebook Live video and look at the comments section it's pure comedy like she thinks I'm making up stories on the air that's not how this works lady I go\nI get we don't we don't make up facts we find out what the major news outlets are reporting on we tell you that information and then I respond to it and I try to piece together facts and information so I could for my conclusion oh Mickey you're the best part of the show today I really thought\nWhen the phones went down in their fix by the way the Folger backup if anybody wants to get it on this Seventy one three two one two five nine five zero seven when three two one two five nine five zero of anybody wants to get it on this the phones are back up now\nAnd congratulations to the find folks in the engineering department ... it was a quick it was a quick problem we got extra credit now my producer crisis in the comments section this is\nMy Facebook Live videos have turned into nothing short of a of a three ring circus today because I'm starting to attract the kind of people I wanted to get I wanted to get people into the show who are libertarians mission accomplished\nAll the libertarians in Houston have been listening to pursuit of happiness radio since it went on the air it's one of the only shows in in Houston that's focused on what libertarians are doing man I wanted to get like the ... the Republicans and America guys we have a lot in common with those guys I Want to I Want to bridge the gap between them I Want to shorten the divide I I think we could work with those guys and a lot of ways we have\nYou guys are seen what Rand Paul has done with Donald Trump over the last couple of years it's been fantastic and I want to do the same thing with this radio show but last but not least certainly not least I Want to get the really really cringe worthy laughable progressive trolls to check out my show\nAnd they're doing it [laughter] I [laughter] I had a whole\nNother segment prepared right now but this is infinitely more interesting than that [laughter]\nOh it's a it's it's too much fun I mean here's what I wanted to talk about what I wanted to talk about was the migrant caravan hey Mickey if you thought I was lying about that news story that I just read from CNN dot com do you where do you hear\nThis Fox News sends a reporter out to the Caribbean now how big is the Caribbean now we know it's at least seven thousand people oh Micky are going to have as we know what's at least seven thousand people and we know that uh the the numbers could maybe be as high as ten people are reporting some big numbers\nI always try to go with the lower side of is to just say it's at least seven thousand so for the purpose of reporting honestly so people like Mickey out there\nUh you know don't stay up all night are biting their nails over what I've said on the radio today we just like to address things to be truthful and honest with you 'cause that's me I'm a nice guy um I like honesty and I like the truth well Fox News sends a guy out today\nI think it was actually yesterday they send a reporter out Chris sent me this new story my producer this happened yesterday right\nThey send a guy out to walk amongst people in the Caribbean and ask them look here's what people are really worried about in America we don't dislike foreigners we want the world's entrepreneur and scientists and doctors and dentists and all the hardworking law abiding citizens to come to America\nCome here absolutely there's room in America for every one that's not what this is about I'm not like Tom Cotton in Arkansas I don't think that we should seal off the border I don't think we should do that at all\nUm there are places along the border where there's legitimately a human rights crisis happening and we need to do something about that because people are getting raped and kidnapped tortured and worst out there where the cartels and the coyotes control things murder local journalists and pay off police officers to look the other way that's\nA problem right but but similarly this caravan what we're worried about here is the same thing is there somebody in this\nCaravan that's that's not coming to get asylum that's not a refugee there's there's somebody in the Caribbean\nWho maybe is friendly I must Thirteen or Los Zetas or the Gulf Cartel and they're trying to escape persecution in Central America because they broke the law down there and they figure out we'll go to one of the sanctuary cities in America and will hide out so the Fox news reporter is walking around\nAnd he finds that guy and he asked them what what's the truth either criminals here in this crowd and the guy is a very honest answer some of those everywhere [noise]\nIs claiming will say here I mean it is\nA guy in the Caribbean is even admitting it they're criminals everywhere they're criminals here there are and that's what he's saying right now for those that are\nCurious about that what does he go on to say he goes on to make the point that the five second soundbite what happens after that is always a great question what happens after that as he goes on to make the point but there's also women and children and families there but hidden amongst them are criminals who need to be about it I'm kinda went through junior thanks so much for watching everybody don't pick on

along we did go to see him all we did I did get my ticket for Hamilton from my brother at the time we believe that they reserve my friends of Adam's Mike Miller\nAnd when I got there after work I got my ticket and we went and saw it and I assume my brother paid for it so as far as I Know that was the deal so don't assume anything about me just because I just because it's weird suspicious\nOr going on about how I was able to attend a Broadway play this is so silly but it matters\nThe issue at hand revolves around how Gillum\nObtained the Broadway tickets\nAnd also questions about payments for trips to New York city in Costa Rica and it looks like a little bit of cronyism is taking place here I mean that's what it looks like we don't know we do know\nGillum maintain that he believed his brother and not the undercover agent paid for the ticket yeah okay well what is your brother tell you that seems kind of obvious right isn't this weird it's such a strange suspicious story but records released as part of the subpoena by the lawyer\nFor former Florida lobbyist Adam Corey that's why he's a onetime Gillum ally seemed to paint a totally different picture looks looks a little bit like Caroline Islam\nGillum attended the Broadway show along with his brother Corey and Miller the undercover FBI agent that's when he's called in the report quote unquote Miller\nHere's with attacks that Cory texted Gillum on August tags ten twenty sixteen and he said just checking in with you Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight and eight PM\nWhat Mike Miller had the tickets you wait you knew that in the Gila replied\nAwesome news about Hamilton oh great we get to see him up and oh gosh\nThis is why local corruption looks like folks it really does he claims he's not under investigation well why would a law enforcement agents sending undercover agent to line their pockets if it wasn't for an investigation isn't it obvious what's going on here is getting investigated by the FBI but why\nThis is this issue\nIs definitely getting a lot of attention and foreign it's getting a lot of attraction and other people on the national stage you're talking about it as well but I I just think people in Houston should know about this this looks awfully familiar doesn't it like we've seen things in the past where Sheila Jackson Lee just suspiciously showed up at high profile events like\nWell like the super bowl for one but also Michael Jackson's funeral and you just gotta ask yourself how did she end up with these places\n[laughter] how did Andrew Gillum end up in Hamilton with an undercover FBI agent obviously there's more to the story than what we're seeing\nJust as there was a Sheila Jackson Lee you know I'm not suggesting that the two of these things run complete parallels to each other but\nIt's sketchy at shady\nWell anyway here's a little more on a here's a little more any Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum if you live in Florida and we don't we live in Texas but if we ... but if you could skip a stone across the Gulf of Mexico you'd hit Florida so what happens over there are clearly affects us right for the gubernatorial Kennedy\nAndrew Gillum he's now facing questions were claiming\nUm during Sunday night's debate that he had no idea what Ron dissent has was referring to\nWhen referencing a pledge to kill him sign that supports radical manifesto radical I never signed a radical I've no idea what pledge referring to the center says the fact is Andrew signed a pledge with the dream defenders pledging his support so radical manifesto\nI think you could kind of guess what the dream defenders is just by the name but let's talk about it a little\nNot only to give them sign the pledge and question he has evidence to close personal and professional relationship with the dream defenders it's a group that promoted the pledge right Gillum talked about eating the group's activism and he wrote in strong support of the dream defenders and their cofounder Philip cameo\nAnd new himself recently described along and close relationship with Andrew Gillum so yeah clearly there's more than what you're telling us here dude\nDream defenders papers elected officials pledging June or was signed by going along with three other democratic gubernatorial candidates\nFor the freedom papers and turns explains the police and prisons have no place in justice white [laughter]\nThe pledge contain specific language dating I pledge my support to the freedom papers\nBecause because police and prisons have no place in justice what no place to justice you mean the people who are in charge of capturing people who committed crimes and the place where we put them after they've committed said crime I hate to burst your bubble Andrew Gillum but\nPolice and prisons definitely have a place injustice and by the way you're in line when you're saying that you're not signing this pledge Andrew Gillum little bit of dishonesty issues here

are back from ray greetings folks that you're getting up with us it's friday morning October twenty six you made it at the end of the week thank you so much for joining us here in pursuit of happiness radio on KNPR see I'm really excited about my next guest I I have a lot of respect for this guy\nI always have a big I always have a big deal of respect for the underdog in any political raised particularly when it's somebody who represents my ideology my principles my believes\nYou know for those of us and the liberty movement constantly torn\nBetween two things\nDo we support the Republican Party and possibly compromise our principles on a number of issues but ended up getting someone who at least Begley supports where we believe in you know depending on the candidate of course some candidates more liberty oriented than others or\nRent reimpose now Lindsey Graham for example but but we all know that this is often the case in Texas you got big government conservatives in small government conservative Jim neo cons and Tea Party guys that's pretty much who make up the the Texas Republican parties but\nWhat about the other choices were your other choices are big government sadism Democratic Party never a good option right I mean we all we all know what the Democratic Party is in Texas even in Texas\nThere's still not really monitor its I digress and then there's the L. P. the Libertarian Party well there is one guy I'm hearing here in the state of Texas I consider him to be an ally in our\nIn our fight for liberty his name is Tom glass he's running for Texas Senate in district seven Tom I'm ... ... where where exactly give it give us the skinny right now and what's going on with you and what is in in what exactly is it that you think is the most important to Texas voters the season\n[noise] great when I'm Talking to voters out there every day and I am in the early voting locations people are telling me across the political spectrum and across racial lines that the appraisal process that we have\nIs arbitrary wasteful and maddening most people especially people from the left understand that it is the appraisal process that causes the values of property to go up every year and especially in poor neighborhoods to go up when a new house is nice houses built in a poor neighborhood\nCauses them to skyrocket that is driving poor people out of their homes up of course property taxes are going up as high as they are driving middle class and upper class people out of their homes as well\nBut the appraisal process is the thing that we've got to get under control and it's a very simple solution\nWhile you have to do is freeze evaluations that we have now and say they're not going to change until your property is sold and from here forward\nWe will appraise the property adage purchase price and then once again it's frozen until you you go then that way you don't get pushed out of your home just because somebody improves your neighborhood\nWow okay I mean that's very kind and drive time I'm a millennial and I'm I Am currently\nThe owner of my first home I never bought a home before I moved to Texas I'm really excited about that and I want people to make improvements to my neighborhood I live in a nice middle class neighborhood and I'm right in between a high high cost\nGated community and then just on the other side of me a few blocks away section eight which I think is which I think for those of us that live in the city he's the case for a lot of us a lot of us live near a bad neighborhood in a nice neighborhood and I never really considered before how you explain that why is it that the Republicans\nAnd the Democrats don't share the opinion that you do of the problem with uh with with with tax appraisal reform\nWell here's the thing the Republican rank and file the people showed up at the Republican state convention very much do you think of this as a solution and the problem uh they they put it is there one of their top five legislative priorities\nTo replace the maintenance an operation portion of the school property tax sales tax and the other major portion of that was to switch to the very solution I just proposed to make the appraised property be what the purchase price is and freeze it they're they're after\nThe problem is that the elected officials of the Republican Party at least some and in in this situation my opponent Paul Bettencourt in state Senate district seven or not following that legislative priority\nAnd so what I'm telling people is on this and other legislative priorities are the Republican Party if you want a state senator working on that in this district you're going to have to vote for a libertarian Tom glass\nWell well ... well explained um for those that don't know what I'm sure a lot of people do especially those that are in Texas district seven\nThis basically covers the northwest side of the suburbs of bleeds into the city a little bit but mostly we're talking about Jersey village Cyprus Tom Kline in spring that's for ... years running right now I'm ... and I'm curious how how is the reaction to people out there in the Libertarian Party you know\nI've always had this bitter sweet relationship with the Libertarian Party Tom and I know you know that and I know a lot of people do because I Want you guys to win but I also don't want to help the Democrats don't use their even a Democrat challenging you right now\nIs the one of the wonderful things about Senate district seventies gerrymandered can be Republican so heavily that there is no chance under any scenario that the damn well when Paul Bettencourt beat the Democrat in twenty fourteen the last time we had an election in this district by forty six percentage point gap\nRight mange you he got Seventy two percent the damn got twenty six and the libertarian got a little less than two [noise]\nThat means you could literally take half of the Republican vote and switch it to libertarian and the Republican would still be the Democrat or ten points no scenario does the damn when in my district\nAnd what I'm telling people is that means it's risk free to vote for what you want to vote there you have nothing to lose to the libertarian and your liberty to gain in this district\nQuestionnaires about that time I I've always I've always wondered about that sometimes we see it go one way and sometimes we go see go another when a libertarian candidate becomes popular in a district does that generally make the Republican become more liberty minded or more of a state is and what do you think your opponent will do\nMy objective of this is a my campaigned uh I mean I Would love to win and I'm doing everything I can to do so but if I don't my objective is\nTo change the behavior of my state senator so that he works on the priorities of his own party is asked him to work on and then I Want him to work on a show or on my hope is that a maybe\nA you'll listen a little bit more if I get a significant share of the vote I mean we'll we'll see you know there's a lot of Republicans out there\nAre there that you call the run I was I did not consider putting it in court to be a writer or the ... ah I I don't know any votes that he's cast it I disagreed with issues to his priorities that I question and I want him to change his priorities\nAre they there are rhinos they just need to be out there and we have libertarians running against them as well but that's\nNot quite the situation in Senate district seven\nYou know it's interesting 'cause Senate district seven kind of has the opposite problem of what the Texas congressional district nine has Al Green doesn't have a Republican challenger I mean this guy's such an abomination and the only person challenging him he's the Libertarian Party candidate Phil Kurtz who's pro life\nIt seems to actually be very conservative and libertarian standards how'd you know you guys are friends\nYou know he's a wonderful man and I think if you live in a congressional district nine you shouldn't be voting for ...\nYou know and I love that you said that I kinda feel the same way I Would say in the same thing on the show um and I feel like that's the case in there there's probably other places around the taxes I haven't figured it all mall out yet we're ah we're we're libertarians\nAre were were major party candidates are going on challenge short of maybe a libertarian and I think that's what's interesting about your campaign right and also about state\nBasis they're a we have um a case where the Republican needs to go and that's George Bush and uh met any a libertarian\nLevels of learning that are completely different from one out of\n[noise] we know you're out there\nHiding in plain sight living a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to be terminated the grain there's a better way better life at lifestyles unlimited it's time to live their life you did there or you can only do that by creating passive income last show you how\nIt's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings are not in mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited were not calm at lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nWelcome back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a bobsled team\nWill go back to do on the radio show today we're talking about how you've been educated or out of success you have been brainwashed\nInto mediocrity and that you no longer have any ability to do critical thinking to think outside of the box and figure out things for yourself in a manner that would allow you to become financially successful financially free\nSo third article I'm bringing up says almost Seventy percent of millennials regret buying their homes here's why\nAnd it goes on and talks about the fact of liberals are really upset about owning a home but first of all talks about the number of millennials that on their home and it says right now it looks like forty six percent of millennials on their home one percent stay with their friends\nAnd get a little more light on that uh eleven percent stay with their parents I'm Sorry forty two percent on their own home forty six percent rent a and a ... percent say with their parents were present stations ...\nAnd these ... decided that they made some really bad mistakes in buying a home Seventy percent of them be like they've made a very bad mistake in purchasing their home so let's talk about the mistakes that felt that they made\nAnd let's talk about why they made them the number one mistake they feel like they made is they feel like they put too much down on their personal residents\nNow that's a very logical thing to figure out after you do it but in the beginning\nEvery pundit you run into\nYour mother or your father your cousin your attorney or a CPA your doctor your financial planner all we are going to tell you put as much down as you possibly can to get your payments as low as you can add to get to sleep paid off as quickly as you can\n[noise] what they do they end up creating a cash poor environment\nAnd secondly they create an environment where they had no income and they can never get back that money that they save their life savings to put down around our house\nWhat should have done two things completely differently\nAnd only someone to actually understands why money financed which is none of the people I just mentioned I guarantee you know financial planner out there is smart enough to understand\nWhat they should have dealt with taking all of that money they put down and bought rental income so now they have more income to pay the mortgage no whip\nAnd they have three or four times the assets working for them number to an owner occupied can get into a home for zero down so they can still have a home so you've now got the asset of your personal residents accumulating\nA appreciation mortgage pay down all the benefits tax benefits which have been taken away by the way uh to some extent a ... and you also had these rental properties and for you know six hundred and think about six hundred thousand dollar house\nThat these guys were talking about if they put twenty percent down which would be the typical down payment\nYou know God I Can't even do that math is just so insane or mine well she's six hundred and eighty thousand dollar house\nTemper sat down and we'll be sixty eight thousand dollars you could have gone out and bought for rent houses with that twenty percent that would be\nA hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty thousand dollars you could have bought you know eight rent houses with that think of if they put twenty percent down they could have bought eight red houses made five hundred dollars a house\nAnd be making four thousand dollars a month more casual towards that mortgage payment towards is just their life for that matter he wouldn't need to drive ... if you make forty eight thousand dollars a year tax free\nBy his rental properties remembered tax free forty thousand is equivalent to that sixty nine thousand they both earned by having jobs\nSo they're insane to put that money down on the house is just insanity no guy sent me emails to all you do is yellow people are yell at you because you're not listening you're not paying attention as the successful\nPeople will get wealthier a wealthier wealthier and you're seeing that the smart people in our society are educated people educated in finance are getting wealthier every single day year month whatever\nAnd the middle class has gone that's what they're saying the middle class is gone now\nSo I could think about owning a home is they buy to larger home we've all been taught or a turtle was by the largest home you could possibly afford right because then over Thirty years you'll pay it off it would be your largest after a\nWhile Gomez Iraq your dollhouse pour you can't afford the payments and the second largest thing that they're complaining about is not the payments they knew the paper's going to be it's the upkeep and maintenance the reason forty six percent of\nMillennials lip read in the department is because when they call the apartment for making this there's a maintenance guy to come pick stuff now\nI just got off the ball with another person in my neighborhood and we're sitting here fighting with the landscape crews that have been doing our neighborhood for a year they just crippled\nThe cost of landscaping the cost of ... landscaping all my house is more than most people pay for the personal home residents mortgage payment and automobile payments\nEach month that's why landscaping and yet\nWhat happened was nuts 'cause they just tripled became wasn't that much before but they're just tripled to that and so a couple of names all of which you will to live in this neighborhood you up to be smart enough to be wealthy enough to Libya right got together and sort of decision saying these people don't know what they're doing\nAnd so we all go out look for some way to solve the problem but really the real problem is what my dad taught me a long time ago when I was a kid and that is is is not what it costs to buy it what it costs to maintain it\nAnd if you go out there by yourself a whole before you're financially able and capable to take care of it\nThen you were doing yourself to financial disaster the rest of your\nYes my friends we had been educated into poverty have a great day we'll see you tomorrow [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] ah\n[noise]\n\nRadio show him how much memory you'll get obtained there was never really enjoy the seven

even as a suspect was taken into custody identified at fifty six year old seizure say black who's been accused before making terroristic threat\nTo my couch where I can eat potato chips and watch television but I'm the cousin asked not to be identified which kind of makes you wonder like\nThese anonymous sources to the press are are so unreliable but it does appear as though he was a steroid user according to his legal records and also that he was a stripper Cornell at least one person went on the record appears as though his cousin is validated some of this information so ah the\nCousin said that steroids might have affected his brain yeah I think that's probably pretty likely I tell people this all the time\nYou want to drinks a BJ hookers vodka you want to drink a little a Texas giant bourbon is fantastic for you\nYou drink that you go to sleep later on you wake up maybe with a little hang over but probably you'll be fine as long as you don't over indulge hey look you fly to

here anyway the cousin said that he's something of a loose cannon he's always been a last saw too many steroids in his day that stuff will melt your brand I tend to agree so what's his political affiliation well and fortunately for people on us on our side you appears to be a Republican\nHis family was involved in fighting the Communist Party of the Philippines that's interesting right but he is a seminal a Native American Indian as well so I don't know\nMaybe part Philippine or part Native American or we haven't had a chance to get the DNA results back yet on him but according online records he's registered with the GOP he registered with a GOP in Florida in March twenty sixteen which means he hasn't necessarily\nBeen on the record as a Republican for a very long time at least not necessarily important kind of a kind of a Johnny come lately appears to have gotten joined up with the flock right before the twenty sixteen election right I'm Sorry that goes by sea\nThese are al teary ring ... on Facebook a in case you want to look him up over there it looks like his page has already been taken down yet drawn in there and that's the big Facebook in the federal government to

October surprises nobody expected the I\nDon't even want to call in the back of bomber but that's what people in the media are calling him and I it it's certainly going to have at least some effect on the mid term elections just like the Caribbean is neither of these things were preconceived\nBy anybody in the Democrat or Republican Party at least not as far as we know and yet here we are just less than two weeks away from election day and yeah the the people in the Caribbean do appear to be pretty dangerous don't they\n... are white power to Donald Trump junior ended up being open by his wife

proceed avenues radio right after this\nYou are listening to pursuit of happiness radio [noise]\nOh wow wow well that music tells me were coming back to the break we'll come back to the zoo to happiness radio if you're just tuning in that's where you're at I'm Ken Webster junior and apparently they've captured this guy the media calls\nHim the magnet bomber but\nLet's call him by his real name Cesar ... his name and I I'm not going to use that name a lot I I I don't feel like this is real different from news coverage for a mass\nShooting except for a couple of differences um nobody got hurt first of all\nBut the sensationalism and and the constant coverage of this new story is strikingly similar to when there's a mass shooting and whenever there's a mass shooting this is one of the few things I agree with people on the left about if you say the suspects name too much\nYou'll start to make some crazy person out there in terrestrial broadcast world saying hey this is how you get famous so I don't want people to think that ah I also don't want to call them the ... so we need to come up with a new name for this guy I don't know Jack leg or D bad or something I don't know we need to come up with a name for him\nSo that so that people will know who I'm Talking about um and yeah by the way the guy apparently has a Twitter account up online I'm looking at it right now and uh yeah I'd say it's a lot of stuff on Florida politics or he's not a big fan Andrew Gillum\nOr not surprisingly very surprisingly is a steroid user or act steroid use or I don't know what his current drug situation is like spent some time as a stripper Windsor catering\nCompany his family spent time in the Philippines involved in a binding militants over there which ... which is a bit odd right before we went to a break time I wanted you to finish up your point so go ahead why don't you finish your statement sir\nYeah well I was on the thing with the you know the the bomber now a caravan these stories are playing out extremely scripted a random in his hand on your speaking about all the details we are less than three hours to capture right\nAt all this stuff out on this dude already right exactly and it is the personal information you know almost like it's scripted reminds me very much of\nTimothy McVeigh after the Oklahoma City there were about the first five hours and for them and that's the way it was two fellows in a brown camino driving away mhm\nAnd then all of this cat that was a anti government here in in support of a David Koresh down their Waco and he went to a gun show all of a sudden we have our our ... you know\nAnd then and then they knew a lot of information about him very quickly and in a good call Tom and\nI and and another question that brings up to me is\nHow did this is something one of our listeners just setting the Facebook Live stream or live on Facebook Live right now if anybody feels a little voyeuristic and you want to watch us one of our listeners name Austin and the comments section here just pointed out\nIsn't it weird how this guy was a steroid use a stripper and he was able to get the addresses the personal home addresses of all these high ranking members of the government it's a it's a bit suspicious I mean I I\nI'm Still not sure how I feel about it I Can't wrap my head around the time you want to go see Los Lobos a Muslim the boys\nOh what a week is hey what day of the week is that I don't know yeah we're not really sure yeah I Know it's a man of yeah tell you what I Want to\nPut you on hold we'll see if we can keep up with something that you so much for the call Tom I'm much jump over here who's been on hold the longest re in DC what's on your mind sir [noise]\nIn a kennel 'em that we're not we're coming in\nHey man they said the appreciation of how you doing sir\nI just got back from them you know the president so that\nOh how did it go you met the president that's very interesting\nYeah it was it one way or how I like that way right if I thought that you know about the situation with that bomber I don't know anything about it because I never really had to have to look at it you know I was kind of in the White House\nWow how interesting yeah so I guess there was a lot of chaos going on over there I\nThought the rope that that will clear what\nWere the protesters blaming Trump for the for the bomb scares\nPretty much of core and also the fact that it was a young black leaders summit at the White House why we're so why were you there though I'm ... some kind of what you say\nWait a second rate you called before you're a brother I didn't know that yeah oh right on man that's going to just check and I'm just curious right on so so you're there you're there for those that are curious how I Know anything about ray rice called before she's a college aged pre law student from taxes moved up to Massachusetts\nGood for you or a man my hat goes off to your brother that's very cool so so so how much longer you going to be out there for\nA phone call right on man hey while you're in town a band I don't know what\nThe heck did you uh DC I bet I know somebody who doesn't know hang on a second let's jump over here to line five Sandy what would somebody do in DC this time of year it's too late for the cherry blossoms right right\nThey always sound like stuff today that there you can you can never go wrong spending time with some of them are wandering around the air and Space Museum or the national portrait gallery or something like that but what you really need to do as a way to call his mother um I Know it's a matter\nOf right now or a you know raise mom was so we're really I never\nHave I Know I Know right uh I never had a couple of like Katie or a\nTown hall do you want to go away and I met Ray's mom I don't think I don't think you know read that you may have met his law you know what I wanted to\nRe here's what you should do dude here's what you should do rare you still there ray you should go up to the Newseum it's it's like the word museum but with news in it as in like journalism news museum and there is a big controversy there earlier this year they didn't want people to\nUm sell magazine had similar gift shop and they were doing it which is weird 'cause I guess the museum is is ran by a liberal or a Democrat or something but they refused to take their hats down because they set out people are buying 'em we're trying to run a business here you know what I'm saying\nYeah I I remember that but that basically somebody said how can you can eat ban hats when when we were supposed to be supporting crispy\nYeah but that's right that's part of yeah that's all free speech it's all it all goes together man the whole ... right I uh I I for one am a ... and pretty uh\nPretty surprised at how crazy today's news cycle has been Sandra there's been no shortage of chaos today a ... that ... took a backseat pretty quick to this new thing with arresting the
