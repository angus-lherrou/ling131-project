C. plus plus but we uh do everything from conceptual process studies all the way through construction commissioning and started up of a basically any type of ah oil and gas unit that a chemical used it a\nNeed will argue believe this is just above my head but from what I can gather during the break when we talked you guys process chemicals process or process gas and people call you you do the engineering you the general contractors they build some facility to process stuff is that accurate\nWell all of our clients process stuff trying yeah we're the people behind it to build it so they can process it\nSo talk to me a little bit about the last year or so right with an uptick in oil and an uptick in drilling we've talked drillers talked to a pipeline guys talk to us a little bit about because I Would imagine you guys are quite busy right now\nWe are very busy in fact we're seeing a significant growth just a across all of our markets were were involved in oil gas petrochemical so with oil prices high and in gas prices low it's it's really the perfect storm\n... or ... a lot of holes in the ground right and they're paying a lot of product out ... and all that product needs to process are you guys building because people were running out of capacity are you building because there's something different about uh what's being pulled out that need some some adjustments to to to what the how the process\nWell you know it's a mixture of both there's a lot of exploration in West Texas people want to get it to Corpus Christi or Houston or so they can exploit it but at the same time the crew that were processing now there's a lot different than what most of the plants\nWere redesigned to do you know several years ago okay a lot of the imports were more heavy sour crude and we're back to using their own or are you using our own and most of it's light sweet\nPlus it has a lot of a natural gas liquids and then also I Want to natural gas associated with it too so you know feed stocks have changed significantly you have to change the processing plants to make up for that so that all this good for business right it's a perfect storm for us absolutely\nSo on the engineering side you guys have a significant amount of engineers on hand ready to do this right\nYeah we sure do you know if our our staff was seven hundred um most of those are engineers or that we have a lot of people in planning project controls you know those types of ... a physician's\nInteresting so where is that these projects are coming from 'cause there's some changes coming some ... some of them being in Corpus Christi they're doing some work on the porch or doing some uh dredging so they can get bigger a bigger ships in there how does that affect your business and in the is simply the oil industry in Texas right by extension\nYou know it's really great to what the changes in the export laws for oil port a Corpus Christi is wanting to deepen their channel or the report says they can take in the\n... a very large true carrying\nA cargo ships and are in Port Arthur ... navigation districts doing the same thing so they have huge projects associated with a place in the pipelines deeper that run across the port so that they can dredge it uh to meet the new death requirements so a lot of work associated with that and then a lot of work\nOf course associate with just building the pipelines to get some sort of ...\nYeah well ... ... it sounds like a a massive project now with the ability to get bigger ships and that means bigger volume of product moving through those capitalism is that accurate and so more needs to that so capacity nice increase to be able to account for the increased volume ship\nYou're correct yeah a lot of the big pipeline projects you see now are going towards Corpus Christi Houston or poor Port Arthur you know there's just not enough capacity in the high points to get everything from from west Texas and the other a large crude at producing areas to export terminals\nNow how sensitive\nHaving those [noise]\nAnd for ...\nWell how do you create the Lincoln presents you need to drive sales in Hampshire brand and recruit top talent

I mean they don't read body burns down Google to solve their problems\nRight right and people get this on the consumer side my messages yeah everything I'm saying applies to consumer focus companies that need to be Ninety four percent of people are researching online and they're making up about two thirds of their purchase decision before they reach out to the very first vendor you're out there with content you're not getting found\nWell in this gets even better because a lot of the ... guys the industry generally sucks at it\nOf very much more I'm Out of what I mean it's not a consumer being I mean if you\nIn the you know direct to consumer spam filtering but it can be a lot harder fight than it is if you're in the you know industrial filters business right I mean the industrial Phil ... I don't know anything about that by the way of making it up as an example but\nThey're not going to be as good at that is what some of these consumer industries and there's low hanging fruit to\nWrite a story I talked about a hundred and twenty groups a year which probably represents collectively a thousand be it'll be companies and I am constantly amazed\nHow bad they are at this which means that if you decide you want to you know pick up the ball and run with it it's a pretty clear playing field and I've I've worked with companies that have just seen the traffic goes through the roof because they decided they were going to focus a little bit on creating content and delivering up these social media platforms\nWell I'll tell you what are you know it's it's interesting that company and I and I've read articles about this in in ten years ago when my wife is a real estate brokers we put and built a media company in it\nFor that identical purpose right to to ensure that we had massive amounts of high quality content going out to play that long game with with searches\nHow how many companies are going to have to develop something like that within their own company and the near future\nUm I'll just say all of the survivors\nThat that's a good way to put a really critical because so much of the traffic starts with a search and not ever if you don't want your competitors getting and found and framing that purchase decision right you're going to lose since so we want to play that game I Do have a warning\nPeople our typing in some key words that represent what you do\nAnd their words are not necessarily your lingo right so we actually have to use some\nScience some data to figure out what people search for an athlete Google provides a wonderful free tool\nIt's called the key word planner and it shows you search frequency on any term in fact when you put in one term and it'll show you hundreds of others that are related and all we want to do is pick terms that have a high enough search for him to be interesting\nBut also show you how competitive it has to get ranked and so we want the ones that aren't that competitive and this tends to point you to more specific search terms what we talk about the long tale so it's not just one word it's usually a combination of words\nBut here's where I see people in the market that are that in and I keep hearing about this because I hear all the time I Will get you on the first page [laughter] they are selling a solution wrong problem you don't mean to be on the first page or do you mean the first page of Google for hundreds of items right\nWell often what they're talking about first of all Ninety nine percent of those people are ... well I got it yeah and and if they're legit what they're probably talking about is the paid advertising write the paper collect stuff that's how somebody can guarantee you're out and you pay you can be ... on Google that's not the real game the real game is let's get", "show_name": "Texas Business Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
