guess you had your car and shot anyway I just thought he was still wants to back uh unfortunately that belong to\nMeet race will give him my reading or your race I was going to give it to Serena

probably about ... oh this is the power I'm Talking about\nMotion and here that I'm offended by seeing how people can see this you draw you haul this guy before Congress right now wait\nThat's really what you're after you want to get involved up front to stop problems before they'd come rather than it's very costly if they what do they have a crisis and then they Brian Kearney it\nWhat you guys to go and you become their attorney general counsel on call kind of thing you get to know their business and the New Bern expert John if ... if necessary\nThat's exactly right and and and what I mean just to let the secret out the big companies and I say big companies large multinational right when he said figure this out\nThey that's why you have large legal department for large fortune fifty companies they've decided if we go bring lawyers in house teach them business they will sit with our our piano owners the BP's and they'll identify the gaps in the legal risk in their business plans before they get their\nSmaller companies can't afford to hire highly skilled trained lawyers out of big firms and pay 'em what they are demanding sure and what we say is look we can provide you those skilled senior lawyers at a price point you can afford to do the same thing that the big companies are doing\nWell and more importantly than that though because of the legal profession is a it's a very big left and right limit right I mean there's there's all kinds of specialization isn't there a but your ability to quarterback said that's right and identify a okay we need pat and help here we need a specialization or here\nBecause as a as a business owner I'm not going to know the different I'm not I'm not going to necessarily be able to identify that I Need specialist here there and uh and you also ability to do that is going to save a lot of time and energy for that seat you\nMadam you hit it on the head because what we do is we become the legal quarterbacks business guys or business guys they got to run their businesses true what they're good at they don't need to be basically dealing with legal issues gimme someone I can trust to go quarterback that manage that and they can go grow their business that's what we do I'll give you an example\nI had a client that actually he was a CEO of a company here he went over to London and he was managing a oil company in London publicly traded\nHe asked us to provide services because he loved the model for his company in London so we were going back and forth between Houston in London to basically quarterback be his\nYeah because you don't know the laws so I mean you're not the right but\nYou know how to go find the expert and and and you know how to vet the expert and you know how to make sure that that they're getting the right things that they mentioned that we did because I'm telling you that to an entire minefield in and do what's right I mean we've talked companies that are going international we've talked companies that are screwed up going international rights because they didn't understand that\nSome of the legal framework of the country they're going in but having somebody trusted here\nUh it it makes a lot of sense not talk to me about some of the ... you talked about you know a company has a has an emergency right in some of some of the calls you get or or or nine one one calls right we need we need lawyers right to to fix this\nGive me a flavor for some of those because I can imagine a okay you get sued or you find out your contracts aren't worth the paper written on because there's a hole in a more water some of the other reasons why you get those emergency\nPhone calls give me a good example at a client or a smaller company in a smaller size they were between\nTwo to four million in revenue IT company and they got threatened with three lawsuits because of the services they provide it there were an installer a computer equipment they would go buy from the oh yeah yeah and install it let's say with the hospital or a law firm or a small business\nWhile they were in the middle they bought equipment for someone else and they do the install\nWhere they were getting threatened by the end user customers because it doesn't work so if it's not work and who who's going to get the finger pointed out it's going to be the person in the middle and\nEverybody in that chain is going to each other right\nYep so they had three threats of stuff not working and so they had a fire and so they called us and they actually ask can you come in and help us figure this out try to get this behind as we got involved early on settle the three disputes got those out of the way but\nWe didn't stop there he said look look at your business guys you got to put some things in to prevent this in the future implemented a legal strategy and they never looked back the company has grown jungle\nAnd that legal strategy may want rewriting contracts that kind of thing\nMy my clients did not have any contracts they didn't have their own form contracts some of their deal they have contracts in place got it and so that's what created the exposure so we created their own form contracts and we train there are people on how to use them and so they could take those out to the marketplace they look more credible so their business cruiser Brazil\nSo when in a in a growing company when do they need this type certainly cause I mean I I've I've been there I've been the guy that has been growing his business and I didn't need it at the beginning but at the end I certainly did and I'm not sure when in that path into a across the line and needed how do they know\nSo mad I Would actually say they needed at the beginning most business owners they know that they need they need a marketing function or a business development function or sales function they know they needed ops function right to get this stuff made they know that they need a finance function\nBut what most business owners don't realize is that you can get value out at least legal bake it into your business early on so you don't have the blow up on the ...\nInteresting interesting stuff Greg Philips

is let's get into this die because it's going to be a great program I have in the studio with me tie when\nWho is an attorney\nI guess individual turning out I'm not sure what you call it but it's try\nTry when law office is that the name of that is right yes that's right so you're kicked off the program forced try thank you so much for joining us my place I happen to be here thank you for having me well this is going to be fine let me start with you have some expertise let's tell people write off what that is\nSo I Do a lot of a corporate business real estate and merchant acquisitions work um so basically I might be a lawyer and that includes you know one off transactions cheese\nIrving as chief legal advisor to small and medium size businesses\nSo one of the things you like to do though was just be there for them uh for for the company any anything not just legal but the legal perspective on much on non legal things things that they need to be concerned about or be aware of that they're generally wouldn't even think about\nRight yep yep so I'm I've been practicing all since uh two thousand one and uh have been involved in a lotta board meetings and worked with a lot of founder and CEO of company presidents um and uh what I Do is I take all of that experience\nAnd work with founders and CEOs of companies and a lot of times it's just bringing lawyers perspective right to the situation at hand so it may not necessarily be a legal issue but um you know I've I've seen it from a lawyer side and and so that I bring that value to\nUh my ... one of the things we we talked about before we started was a hot issue is just\nCorporate formality you called it yes let's talk about some of those things so these are things that every business owner needs to be aware of right right yeah so what is what would that include\nRight so um you know what so first of all like any good lawyer I'll I'll have to do a little disclaimer that we're just generally talking and we're not I'm not giving a kind of legal advice [laughter]\nYou don't have to tell them what to do them why they got\nThat right yes exactly so let's put that would that done a ... corporate formality is just a general\nA set of guidelines and enrolls in principle that business owners need to be aware of and and follow\nAnd even though the word is corporate you know this applies to corporations and El Al sees a like a mini business entity right any business entity and hear what we're talking about is is following proper procedures so that uh you don't exposed the company to being pierced\nThe tournaments curious about the corporate veil and the point of having corporations analyses is that had\nOne of the reasons is provides liability protection right right so you personally don't are not responsible for the companies are debts liabilities and obligations a but in order to get that shield you have to follow certain formalities so\nSo the the reality is folks is if you're going to have an corporation you're gonna have to say whatever it is whatever the structure is you're doing that super checked yourself to have a ... between you and your company and if you don't follow these rules\nSomeone can come along with ... mice will not have a corporation they're going to sue ... so let's let's get into some of the things that are best business practices right from this point\nSo um the the one thing that I see a lot of is many times contracts are signed um on behalf of the company but it's not proper that doesn't identify the company itself right so for instance you may have a contract\nThat has um you know a beast that's an ABC is the name of the company but on the contract to justice ABC it doesn't end in a fight as a ... in an L. C. so it's not formal\nUm so signing contracts make let's just make sure that the company name is properly identified and even if it's a de da you can say you know\nI'm widget maker db a ABC ain't or ABC ... feet or something like that so uh one contracting it identified the proper corporate or entity name um\nYou mentioned co mingling I think it was a big deal right\n... the co mingling is another concept where if you are actually running a business you have a separate entity you've got to ... separate its assets and liabilities from your own personal\nI'm so that means that you should not be\nUsing company's funds writing checks out of the company's bank account to pay your mortgage or your you know private car or a trip um unless it's a business trip but uh ... let's just make sure that the funds properly allocated to the business and if you need to take some of that money out for your personal then\nIt's gonna be through a distribution a dividend um something like ... got to be a formal\nThat's wrong relationship now I have to Al Al ... and obviously I have a personal lot those all gotta stay absolutely don't want to co mingled All right and the our actual by if I put I mean just about anything to do just got to be careful where you do it from to make sure you don't work the shield", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Texas Business Radio", "city": "Houston", "day": "06"}
