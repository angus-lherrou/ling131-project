Ali winds as a a an idea that I had years ago to ah when I was down in Argentina and I found an opportunity to invest in a small vineyard in a larger development and make wine super premium winds in Argentina and bring them up here\nAt first we were following more of a Blue Bell type model drink all we can\nAnd finally we decided well maybe we should sell the rest that uh we couldn't drink enough of the wind that are grapes were producing so in two thousand fourteen we created a\nCommercialization venture to try to sell the rest of our winds and into thousands Seventeen we created a winery of Texas which provided us with the venue to be able to market our wines\nAre we is simply a wild idea is basically the dream that I had and years ago back in two thousand eight when I first got into this to ah\nFor the venture and I tried to pitch it to my friends and so far but a lot of success and a lot of fun doing it\nI Love that strategy always means wild idea and you got a wild idea you had a passion for this and you went off and you you did it so you started when two thousand eight two thousand and eight and I understand you actually went down there and planet\nI was actually a well two thousand seven I had to go out to men do so to do a due diligence or with an for another client I just have to be an Argentine outside popped over there found the concepts thought about it quite a bit researched it\nIn two thousand eight a friend of mine uh actually went down and we actually planted or the first acre of ... so\nIs it fair to say this is Texas wine made in Argentina\nNo these are hard time why you're\nArjun we all by Texan company but they're ... quality gripes and the the whole environmental no I think the oil that Argentina is famous for\nYes it's a unique er vines were in the ... valley which is southern Mendoza it's high altitude it was a up and coming region back in a two thousand eight now it's one of the hottest regions in in Argentina producing award winning winds and we've been very successful with our grapes\nYeah so we don't have a lot of time and this is such a great story you tell me how you\nManeuver from being drunk all you can now you're actually selling wine are you selling that to book club\nSelling it through specs or total wines or restaurants how how how could someone\nAnd find it All right now we are selling our wine mainly direct to consumer is we have a a website all we wind dot com which everybody can buy our winds from and we've had some good success there are we've also a branching out to talk to a lot of restaurants I'm\nAn ... or ... to train those cell cycle the bit longer to get into those a lot of competition everybody wants to get on those wind list uh so we continue to do that um I just retired a few weeks ago from a long\nStint and corporate world and now I'm enjoying this uh getting out there but um [noise] we will probably be mainly a direct to consumer will be launching a a wind club when we lie or ... thousand Fifteen winds and a couple of months\nWell tell me about the two thousand fourteenth those were your first real\nIn two thousand fourteen our our winds arrived uh about the same time we received our winery license or one of the first things I did was submitted\nA couple of these wines into the rodeo Houston rodeo wind competition as you know that's one of the largest wine competitions we submitted to have our winds are grand court today which is a of a Bordeaux style blend mainly with about forty percent mall back\nAnd uh we also submitted are cabernet solving young\nUh we're very lucky in our first rodeo we won a gold medal for our grand court today and we also as a reserve class champion and our cabernet solving John was a silver medalist so\nReally so you you just just got in the Senate in to the second largest competition the United states only two lines and won a gold and silver yes that is amazing\nIt was a lot of fun and then we also are also has against\nWell not everybody can see it but we also us make a white wines and so I I make a cabernet uh somehow block and I make a thought on this which is a crisp white wine that's very unique Argentine Argentina and we make a mall deck Rosa say\nOkay so we've got quite a portfolio winds so those folks who are ... are watching this on the video these too\nUm but it's not like we have to send out for someone else bring it in and then ship it out\nSo you just don't go in the laboratory and make do says a lot of work that goes into it\nNo no no it takes in order to a project from start to finish can take six months to a year um um\nIf it works at all um but yes we have a lot of catalog products that someone can just order off the shelf but we also do offer a custom and contract services so if it's not on our site and it's a a a particular a hot protein\nThat needs to be studied by pharmaceutical company or something like that we uh we have a team of very experienced PHD scientists that will work with that investigator to generate a\nFit for fit for purpose or re agents to physically for them\nSo this sounds to me like what you're doing is facilitating the researchers that are finding the solutions in our medical system right you're exactly\nYeah in fact our our tagline or our purpose is to improve lives by supporting scientific discovery\nI'm so he said what we do wow and\nAre you reinventing all the time or do you GET requests than you have to go figure it out or how how is your story ... just a set number new got him in ... but it's a combination of heavy researchers write all we do and it's a it's a\nCombination so a lot of targets that will go after it will be things that we've\nUm read about in the literature or hot particular targets that we need antibodies to\nOr we'll have a a colleague or a collaborator at one of the major institutions or a pharmaceutical company for example call us and say hey we can't find this can you do it for us um and and those are very valuable collaborations as well\nSo there's a lot of research I mean this isn't a miracle industry right now they're they're the problems that are being soft or you're just amazing but God I think a lot of it's round cancer\nWell yeah right now in in a\nCancer research and cancer therapies the immune checkpoint inhibitors a drug you see them advertised on TV all the time um have really revolutionized cancer care and ... will continue to revolutionize cancer care and the next\nIn the coming decade now it may turn out that it ends up bankrupting the country because these things are so expensive yes However I'm\nAt that but we believe that excited about a whole line of antibodies that are specific for these immune checkpoint inhibitors a and four other immune related cells that would be infiltrating a cancer and one of our\nOne of the things that we've worked on recently and that we really are excited about is the opportunity to take these custom built recombination antibodies and put them in a multiplex staff said meaning on a single slide a of a\nA cancer tissue for example I um that's been taken out of that has been taken out of a patient brio for example if a if a\nIf there's a ... on your long or a novel in Nebraska and the doctor does a fine needle aspiration or a core needle biopsy you have a limited amount of tissue right or limited at very limited amount of tissue and if he wants to do\nA understand what markers or on that tumor or in that tumor than if that's all it just would have to do a single slide cut for example for each one of those stain that with\nAn anti um which would consume a great deal of tissue I'm One of the things that were working on now is generating re agents and the opportunity to do\nMultiple stains for multiple targets on a single slide a basically called multiplex team you know history chemistry um and we think that ultimately it's got a really revolutionize a the pathological diagnose\nTo censor like that would save time and money and be more efficient she can do multiple someone slide then that's not normal that's that's new stuff you're working on\nAnd that's that's a new there are other methods out there and other companies that are working on that as well um but again even even more than the time saving is the opportunity to really understand\nThe makeup of the of the tumor of the\nImmune cells that are associated with the tumor and that'll help define what patients are going to uh respond to certain chemotherapies and equally as important what patients are not going to respond to certain therapies so uh\nI I was just at a conference in Boston a week or two ago uh that really highlighted the advances enemy and oncology um but again\nThe importance of the ... agents and the methods for the diagnosis and and really get to that personalized medicine\nSo let me see if I can say this back to 'em in simple terms\nI can understand the patient gets say cancer some short they go in and I\nTake a slice it's very small slice they bring it into the research or to the laboratory and then they use sure antibiotics to test it to find out what types of cells and proteins when there is that what you're saying they\nThey could use one of our antibodies that are often times now and what what are the currently available ones that are in the lab or not using ... or ... researchers who would be studying status tissues as part of a large tissue banks or whatever I Would definitely be using some of ...\nSo you have to be your your ... researchers you're probably well known probably don't have anybody just take orders but what what a very very interesting story what what's going on right now what are you working on right now it's kinda\nUnique well like I said that the multiplex a him you know his to chemistry is probably the that's the most cutting edge type things that we are developing 'em and and in that process where using only recombination we produce antibodies so these are these are full length antibodies grown in cell culture um\nUnbelievable you also mentioned your value proposition which I thought was pretty unique in these give that to us well the\nThe main thing that differentiate step all from a lot of the antibody sellers in the market is that we're not a reseller where a primary manufacture we control the entire antibody life cycle from the design of the antigens\nWhich would be used to raise the antibody or the sheriff vacation I'm the validation all the way to ... putting it into violence shipping it out the door\nFrom the beginning to the un
