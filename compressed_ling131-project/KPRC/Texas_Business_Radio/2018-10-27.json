I was hit a\nCrow in my shoulder are you sure it wasn't a bald eagle now is a crow those are the bald eagle oh have you arrested as I went back and check it out 'cause I I knew I'd kill they hit my shoulder so hard so I went back circle back to see\nThe dead grow and he was dead after about a man that shoulder was sore for a week that was why the impact\nSo woman in New Hampshire said I'm OK and I got to keep the turkey so that he's already tender eyes [laughter] smack you up pretty good\nYou can do what you want to I mean we're not going to sit here and listen to you that\nYou know I\n\n... [laughter] my God I Can't think of some aspects of\nTanks and warfare now we've had tanks in warfare I guess they started in World War one\nIn earnest and then they were real big in World War two\nAnd now tanks are pretty much going to be useful in the battlefield in the future they said because robots firing missiles can render tank useless well all we do is just make a better tanked a few robots firing a few of these new tank piercing missiles have invented you know wipe out of\nA fleet of tanks and no time\nWell every time they come up with some radar all at the police house they come up with a better radar detector and then the police come up with better radar and then they come up with a better right or did they will just keep going back and forth and make these uh senators rich\n[noise] well I think go or the tank they came up with the tanks to tore the trench machine gun warfare the origins\nOf the machine guys with the tanks and just mowing down on a leash a prize or with a tank that will lift off the ground and fly like a drone [noise]\nThat would surprise them if you have something like that let me know and we'll go pitch it\nMakes money do you oh you mean that you know or else get something out for you well I think they require like a working model for they commit to\nInnovate and to do at some I'm probably going to need some better to let a feed the show those generals attack that would take off and fly like a drone it's a matter of fact\nThat's probably the battlefield the future going to be nuts about robots and drone yeah thrown at each other and and the and the combatants the soldiers who he will be the guy sitting at the game console gaming consoles or the joy sticks operating them all\nWell that means we'll just probably be more likely to go to war more frequently if there's a less of a chance of ah the ... man power law that's exactly\nRight and so that was going to happen is whichever one defeats the other one first\nThen the drones and the robots well ... what's your if you run out of ... and robots to oppose the other guys wrote a drones and robots then they come for the human\nProduction when they won the war you got to throw some live and meet\nAt him and then that's when we were in trouble well right now I just like to remember the words of Julia Louis Dreyfus from the pill show\nElaine she said Elaine ... received the Mark Twain prize for American humor Sunday night wasn't dancing I Know that for sure that dancing with the rumors come on she talked about her breast cancer a lot and what healthcare beat it and she says\nCancer is not funny but a big part of ... is finding funny moments well there is a ... she we have the same attitude there is no situation but isn't improved with a couple of laughs well she had looked around the landscape\nOf the nation recently how she comedy is pretty much dead you can't make fun of anything\nBut but you can have a laugh you yourself without broadcasting it to others I'm just a well I tell you\nAbout had it with this lack of humor situation the up and I get no credit\nI beat anorexia hardly ever get anybody to drew look at wall they be anorexia ...\nTo a pulp you focus to anorexia and gave it a ...\nI got no anorexia I\nTalk or no signs of it [laughter] no outward signs have at our interest here to be in your future\nI was able to defeat it I'd like a little notoriety if you don't mind a little celebration maybe a parade or something maybe a book\nEither moral series guys are going at it I Know probably don't have cars are actually heated the Astros to get Boston in the world series Boston and uh LA I'm pretty sure they ... the brewers to get the Dodgers in the world series to at some point in time yeah but not as obvious\nAs stealing home runs away from me and things like that kind of like that that Alabama situation a best way to get the best defensive player off the field make a fake targeting call on me I always gone\nJust made the first time the red Sox and Dodgers have faced off in the world series since Nineteen sixteen hundred and two\nYears ago I think last time they played in a World Series Babe Ruth is on the pitchers\nPardon yeah seriously he was a pitcher before he was\nA hitter yeah that's the reason they have in Boston they have this thing called the curse of the Bambi no\nBecause when the ... left to go to New York apparently he put a they went all those years without any kind of post season play or what not and it was they were cursed by their Bambi no yeah\nBecause he had a I guess he didn't want to go he was happy with this current job a new trade are they old boy\nNow later turned out pretty good for the best thing ever happened to him but he didn't know what is the\nTime he thought oh you oh you are you sending me on my way oh really that car she with the chicken bones\nVoodoo curse you got to kind of lean Boston a little bit on this just by the numbers in baseball does love their numbers is the first of all Boston won a hundred and eight\nGames this season and then they'd be two other teams to get to the world series\nAnd both of those teams the Yankees and the Astros one over a hundred games this season they were both both previous World Series ... so uh yeah must have had a little tougher road to get there and then manage just knock it out of the bark as they\nSay I would say probably Boston has the edge although Los Angeles probably feels like they're motivated since the Astros beat 'em and seven last\nYear yeah they they got close it's so hard\nIt was tantalizing close for the other team uh celebrate and get all famous and everything\nAnd they thought they had us last year\nWhen they took it to a game seven ... man we got a game seven and it's in Los Angeles we're winning this one\nOpening a ... but he goes Boston slight favors or ... they figure about fifty seven percent so unreal socks uh you know if you've been a hundred dollars or Boston you could win Seventy ... that's not that does\nNot that I bet no money on this thing one of well what if you go ahead and read bet on the Dodgers ... hundred\nYou win a hundred and Fifteen again not a lot of paid back yeah I Want to be if I'm going to take a risk I Want a bigger payoff\nYou got to bet the outside bit the the one with the big odds on them like one player will die during the series or something crazy like that and and if that pays off you're going to get re Joe one player will be blind to what I that sounds like\nYou're in the series if you'd nail that one that's got to be millions [laughter] wow in that\nIt's a little too dark that's like a two dollar bet returns like a million on that land if you name the player than I Do is all your job you get to retire\nYeah [noise] exactly speaking of that money you do know that the power the mega I guess it's mega the one at one point six lottery is tonight yeah so well if you haven't already get your tickets now so that\nYou're not in my way when we get outta here a little while our balls tomorrow night and I didn't know ... that's ... that's crowd in about half a million you probably have begun right there even if you didn't win that oh yeah I take either one and I tell\nYou when when I when I'm either wants\nA wouldn't it be crazy about one above all would be just great so I Want them both or I Want to tell you guys are all\nGoing to be taken care of All right well I'm not appreciate to appreciate that I mean we'll have like a lunch or something big longevity on the house all go and have another drink have another beer if you're on it's on the house did you feel like a woman on a Beijing order lobster champagne and everything yeah it's good\nI got ya go ahead yeah we're good he\nJust get out of here before when his heart attack different kids [laughter]\nAs a I think we need to be talked into break there are you can lose an event or did you lose your right to obtain a pet so there are steps or things that they need to do or not do to preserve that right\nWell I promise you most people don't know exactly what those steps are I mean this is a complex process right\nAh yes there's it's it's very new and especially the the the patent science things\nSo we've talked a little bit about engineers mass absolutely right engineers ... thanks and then they want to protect them but I work with a couple of CEOs that I've been around for a while or companies are pretty nice\nBut they've decided to overcome the ups and downs with your business they need to expand and they've started aren't the operations and you do something like that and that should nukem riding on that what what what research and development or they do it and what's going to end up being Patton knock that and\nThe yes ah the first thing is\nRecognized where that I ... it might be coming from a and also again ensure ownership so you you want to make sure if it's independent contractors that the independent contractor agreements have clauses in place that transfers the uh uh the ownership of die peace to the company\nAbout employees so that if you are employed them and you pay them to do this employee\nHe's usually if as if they are paid to do that if that is\nPart of their duty wears a drought this wealth that they use a do not need to to have in ... but it's a good idea to do that anyway yeah I'm a tell you what I've probably met a hundred of these guys right the the guys that have worked for\nA major company as an engineer they've come up with an idea right and left to be here by the way yeah I mean I mean I Am too I live in an area but uh you know here's where it gets a little dicey though\nThey are employed by a major company they leave major company and they started a company with whatever invention am\nWho owns that idea I mean at what point is this engineer running into trouble if they used company time company software company resources to invent an idea that is now going to compete against the big company big companies don't necessarily appreciate that right\nThat's correct um and usually it do situations will warn litigation sure and uh\nFrom my experience the one that's more most important things or or evidence that people look for their uh is documentation right because you know a lot of ties engineers will come up with an invention but there is no physical evidence of it it's in their head because\nUh invention a pat noble concept is a concept is actually not\nYou know anything physical shirt idea as to cut the conception of that idea that triggers the date of that invention and sometimes it's not you know as well as usually not\nEasy to trace the birth of that idea the birth of that invention and that day or the the data conception usually determines who owns it because if that\nInventor is employed as an engineer for the previous company when they can see the idea then that company\nIt's possible the company ... ... well but oftentimes we don't have documentation sure\nWhere it's it's interesting and it's something that comes up a lot especially in Houston I'm I like I said I Know probably a hundred of these guys the the last thing or talking about is is companies that are expanding by acquisition are getting ready to buy a company that has some kind of intellectual property associated with it\nAre you guys have every ability to come in and help them figure out the landscape of what it is they're buying correct\nAll the time yes especially when they're buying a company that is what technology is central to the value of that company and what they do\nWell I Need to get somebody like you involved right\nThere right yeah well I Would I Would think I mean 'cause 'cause questions that obviously pop up is how will protect it is this idea right and\nIs there anything that I'm going to rub up against right whenever I buy it and is there anything additionally I Need to do to protect it right once I buy it does that ... some of the things that they that you're working on huh exactly\nAll right interesting stuff is Alberto or Amazon junior Amazon McCoy is the law firm a out of Houston, Texas what is the easiest way for someone to

the show Texas business radio Texas business radio dot com being a website for for a one for one for forest twenty four hour ... gets calls and now that I'm In later\nDoesn't really matter to me we're going to get the experts in here to get those questions answered I'm your host Matt register Jake curries normally sitting over there and the co host chair had ducked out he's going to join us here shortly but in the meantime we're going to talk a little bit about\nPersuasion and I don't care what business you're in you're in the business of persuading somebody or persuading a customer you're persuading employees you're persuading somebody and I hate to break this to you but most of you guys are not persuasive most you guys are doing it wrong\nAnd we have an expert in here and it's going to tell us all about it we have experts coming into Texas all the time to talk to CEOs and they have a wealth of information we like to get these guys in here in the segment we like to call the national advisor showcase and this is one of those segments\nDr Christoph Moran who is here from sales brain as you're talking to CEO sales brain as the company the persuasion code is the book\nLet's go ahead and let him tell you about it a doctor more than welcome to the show certain thank you met very very happy to be here with you so tell me a little bit about the persuasion code and sales brain what do you do who do you do it too\nWell you introduce persuasion perfectly you may or may not realize every single day maybe even every single hour we are on a mission to convince a client an employee and how about a family members to those of us who have Parenthood\nA stories will remember how difficult and a frustrating it is to convince your own children well it turns out that persuasion doesn't need to be as painful because there is a science behind it and that's what the book is revealing in terms of uh how it works in the brain\nOkay the science behind we were talking during the break there is that a lot of work and a lot of research that went into what it is you're doing I mean you're talking about measuring hundreds of times a second and brain impulses in sweat uh the tell me a little bit about how you figure out what's effective what is not effective when it comes to persuasion\nSo persuasion in the field of frustration is boring alright I teach I'm a professor of media psychology and I have to go through these old obsolete models where we have a ... for a long time that we are these perfect rational decision making machine\nAnd as long as we organize our arguments logically we're going to close deals in arguments\nIt doesn't work and so I became as a researcher extremely frustrated\nWhen I was talking to people because the stories that we get is I Am a rational person I'm going to decide based on price based on features and someone\nWhen in fact uh the evidence coming from sales data or what we know is the measurement of advertising is that going to a different direction it doesn't uh line up with what people tell us\nSo I decided to not talk to people anymore I decided to measure their brain activity okay and that brought in neuroscience the science of understanding\nHow the brain works into marketing and this was initially a little bit of a controversial subject when I started this two thousand to a lot of people thought I was on a mission to implant chips in people's brains when in fact I was just really trying to reveal what is the biochemical\nPlay inside the brain of attention what is a tension comprehension all those phenomena are explain in the brain\nWell and they and and not doing that does not give you ... you get answers that people want to tell you right they say I'm a logical person I'd buy based on logic when in fact\nThe the evidence points to the opposite direction so you're not getting valuable data without taking measurements of the unconscious uh their their brain activity right\nAnd to make it easier on everybody's mind I Want to introduce a the brain and two\nSystems one system that we all have is considered primal it's on the bottom of the brain and it measures and controls all the activity that corresponds to life you know blood flow temperature heart rate activity your capacity to stay away\nFake is controlled by what's called the primal brain now we don't think about that brain and that's a good thing because you imagine if you have to think of your breathing\nRight no no that's right it controls your basic the lizard brain they call it right I mean that's lizard\nRain with Jillian brain we assume that it's only a fairly effective brain but it doesn't participate in cognition well that's a wrong assumption because our research has demonstrated that to be persuasive to actually be effective in convincing people you have to in fact\nSpeak and communicate to the primal brain first\nInteresting but what percentage of of marketing efforts are going out there that makes no attempt at this and get this wrong I mean\n\n... but the next game for the Houston Cougars will be coming up\nSaturday it'll be five o'clock six o'clock kick off as a five o'clock here the Houston I N G\nSports network it as a at five o'clock pre game shows will get things going on the tailgate show ... got SMU I we all know all too well last time I used to what they asked him you they got beat and they got beat bad and they were heavily favored team in that game um\nNow you got to just go there and you know it's a thing about SMU it it's something in this is all due respect it it means a lot to SMU oh yeah a a Tom Herman had the words about the private school in Dallas in you know it resonates with them and we know the the previous history of Ninety five Twenty one all those different things\nUh it it means a lot to them and I can promise you they will be ready to play\nOh they're going to be ready to play there's no doubt and then you know that the you know there's all kinds of sort of hidden your stories behind the story got you know talking about Ben Hicks for instance that bin ... is is you know highly touted a quarterback coming out of high school committed to the University of Houston the commits that goes DSM you I mean\nYeah there's all kinds of stories like that behind the scenes with these two teams and you know when it comes down to it\nThese are ah SMU does things a lot very similar to the way the Houston does offensively you know they do some same types of things defensively so uh it's gonna be a battle\nI so that'll be coming up from sports stadium in Dallas on the campus of SMU in law gets started at five o'clock as the cougars travel north ... take on the bus pangs of SMU cougars get it done today this was a match up today of two teams with combined records of Thirteen and one\nWhere you put that together there was no game of the country with two teams where they come by better record and then this one today between Houston and us set us up coming into this game rank number twenty of the country but the cougars when it and they win it going away used to go to seven and one\nAt foreign aid conference play well USF drops to seven and one and three and one\nIn copper to play the final score today fifty seven\nThirty six used to knock knock number twenty us have what they call the folks who worked a counter Weingarten back at
