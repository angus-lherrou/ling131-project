{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "So how do you overcome the subduction and some of the other sectors that you like\nWell we've always I'm employed just simple strategy and the strategies we buy companies that have as close to monopolistic pricing as possible\nWe're looking primarily for a relationship between a landlord and attendant excuse the expression but that is abusive in favor of the landlord on a structural and secular base is what we mean by that is you know they have the only thing in town and the tenant needs that only thing I'll give you an example of the cell phone tower\nOr less versus in an apartment and then added apartment complex\nI'm half the people move out every year and they're well informed about other apartments in my living with the prices and so does the landlord right so it's a fair fight okay um let's say instead you're attendant on a cell phone tower you're Eighteen Jay\nAnd you're rolling out five gee and not only can you not leave because if you do if you leave a cell phone tower\nThe guy that lives down the street from that his phone doesn't work that's my teenagers like dude that's not cool and I woke up my phone didn't work and guys as wise as well because we didn't really feel like we're doing at least right and then in addition to that they're rolling out five gee so\nOur our focus is on companies that can grow cash flow much faster than inflation in fact\nThe growth of our portfolio and the casualties is about ten percent per year versus regular real estate at about for now the way we get there is by these companies that have monopolistic positions and monopolistic pricing in their models are in their markets and our ... biggest exposure is to the Internet of things and to data\nUm everybody listening to this this this a show probably has multiple devices right they've got a cell phone and they've gotten eye pad\nAnd they've got a computer at home to work and they have three or four even five devices\nIf you listen to Cisco and Cisco keep track of all this stuff they're telling you that the demand\nFor mobile data is go and get forty percent per year for the next five years\nForty percent for years so it's going to go up something like eight acts between now and twenty twenty two and that's a result of\nBetter apps more enriched apps five and gee and more devices pretty soon your refrigerator we'll talk to your microwave and it'll order milk and it'll report its own diagnostics but the biggest driver of all this we think of the next couple years\nIs self driving vehicles I had the opportunity to go to the pack our\nInnovation center about three weeks ago Packer by the way makes kind of work trucks uh and they make Peterbilt so on the largest truck manufacturers and world they're sixty five engineers in Silicon valley figuring out how to make autonomous vehicles self driving trucks and they can show you a slide shows why this is advantageous for both\nTraffic and you can run the traffic at night and it's easier you know blah blah blah blah blah they give you fifty five ways this makes economic sense\nBut then you get to that his presentation and you go well how much data does issues and the guy says well a self driving vehicles now these are the rudimentary ones that are working on now they're testing in places like Tucson in Scottsdale uses sixty five ... five gigs of data every hour\nThe cell phone ... the the iPhone right in front of me as thirty five mix so a car a rudimentary car they're working on now has uses two thousand times well as much data as my phone this is one car\nImagined this conversation three or four or five years from now when Google has rolled out five hundred of these in Vegas or five thousand of these in New York\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg so we think the way we played is is I don't want to have to pick who's going to make a better car whether it's going to be way mo which is Google or whether it's going to be Amazon or apple or any of that and I don't really care what I Want to do with me and arms dealer\nI Want to sell connectivity in the form of fiber back call\nAnd cell phone connections and distributed intend to systems a small cells are owned by the cell phone tower reach and I wanted to sell data connectivity security and availability through the data centers\nSo we're our arms dealers to this industry we don't care who the winners and losers are but we have a good significant portion of the portfolio invested in cell phone communications reached and data center reason we also have\nA data center company we own in China\nAnd all of this stuff you here in America when it till you forty percent of the growth rate you can double that they're well it's the numbers are off the chart in terms of connectivity and devices and this doesn't include things like artificial intelligence\nAnd machine learning and augmented reality you know I'm into reality by the way it will be the biggest of these three and what I mean by that is\nYour a master mechanic at Boeing and you work on Rolls Royce engines and in front of you as a Rolls Royce engine has passed\nA thousand parts and each of these parts has a replacement cycle in the meantime between failures and put glasses on and glasses show you every part what the serial number was when it was replaced and where to stock now take that little concept of this Boeing engineer applied to everybody does a technical job\nEverybody from your doctor your dentist to Mr good rich\nAnd everyone has access to all the information well things are working on you eliminate mistakes you streamline supplies you are way more efficient and productive this was going to be a revolution in all of this stuff lives in a data center\nAnd gets back and forth across the toll roads that we're buying today in the south tower so basically you're investing at the root of all this was going to be\nThe system is very smart place so we hope so yeah yeah well it's bigger but things don't work immediately and I think you know investors want that immediate gratification uh they lack that patients but I think that the narrative that you pointed out I mean again it makes sense I mean I think many people see self driving cars is a\nProblem however I'd rather have a self driving car than a teenager texting and not paying attention to the road ah yeah me too I Would very much like\nThat or will the beast or at least well these are terrible drivers don't work any of the button or that was some travel drivers basically yeah whereabouts has been a pleasure\nAlways a full of information and ah you know go get stuff and we get by the website if we got access to Berlin and where you can contact them where you can get his writings in a in a sea what he does for for for everybody else but I appreciate it really thick you'd take it taking the time it coming out when\nWe we didn't spend anywhere near enough time with football next time I really want to spend like almost eighty Ninety ... on football\nIs supposed to the playoffs will be more exciting right now I can happen to the season to season alone on what's your call for the quickly [noise]\nUh I hate\nKansas City Missouri charged fan but I have to go to court\nI mean ... that run to my\nJumps over a guy to bring it back [noise] and then you've got to turn to him\nWhat was the only drawback Kansas City Kansas City there to you for listening to the FDA my\nShaving listening to it for entertainment purposes on the second ...\nThe market and you can make money when you pass performance is no guarantee of teachers are nothing set on this show should be considered an offer worse than what the mission to buy forced out any security thing in the last time\nDoes that have helped me in a town of ... and ... ... ... men are\nThe SPA money our program\nBy the Avon\nTo some more motivational material I got to read some more educational stuff\nI actually went back to the other day and my fiance are by an apartment complex right now and I really want her she'd been in operation for Twenty years she knows what to do but I wanted her to be a buyer owner operator so I'm making her take all the classes and not like I'm forcing her she wants to do it but\nShe's taking all the classes to become an owner operator\nAn independent owner so that she could do it if I'm gone to a bar I Want her to be able to go out and continue the business and uh you know perpetuated Dodgers operate the businesses that are already purchased I Want her to know how to go out and purchased properties and do the whole bit\nAnd the people that work in jobs added apartment in in in the apartment industry add an apartment complex\nThey never learn all that they just learn how to lease and manage to collect rent and do the maintenance and so on and so forth so I Want her to have the whole thing but so what it's done is for me [noise]\nIt's got me up taking classes with her now you have to realize that I just signed this whole thing over twenty eight years\nAnd every time I thought there should be another class on the topic I Would say okay who can best do this topic and we put these classes together and in the classes you have to realize that most of the material that got into the classes because I decided that I wanted it there\nBut what was interesting is as I take these clashes man I really recommend you get off the couch\nGet signed up get to these classes and take these classes isn't that was great man this is really really really good stuff even though I Know Ninety nine point nine percent of it and every once in a while I think I missed one question so far because it was kind of a trick question um\n[noise] is to something you know how many things should you know before you do this and\nI had all of them and I guess that's because I Know all of them but they said no only for the five and one of them you didn't need to know type of question but I knew all five of them so I thought you needed all five of my mistake but the bottom line is is that\nJust materials were very very good now\nIf you're not going to take this material you should be taking some other kind of material I'm sitting up the nights before I decided to take this with my fiance I decided to set up and listen to motivational speakers\nAnd I sat there for hours just listening to motivational speaker what'd you realize is that like you're listening this podcast right now I haven't listened you buddy for years because I've had everything I've always wanted\nSo now these guys are telling me well Dell what are you doing you're just sitting there I mean what does it mean to be a multimillionaire when you could be a mega mega multimillionaire and I don't really see the number the numbers the money as something I have to have\nI see it as a score card as what I'm doing what am I doing with my life and how much do I have to give back to society what do I have that I can go out there in place into the world and make it operate do something with it she I don't hoard my money if I go out to invest my money\nThen I'm going out there and making something happen in the world for other people and I think that's an important point however that's not the point that I'm trying to get to today for them trying to get to today is you're wasting\nYour life away there's no way that there isn't only enough hours in the day to go to work come home to eat and then to watch TV\nAny amount of TV you're watching is almost guaranteed to be a complete waste of time\nNews is a complete waste of time you can go away from the news for two three four or five weeks at a time come back and you've missed nothing it's absolutely the way it was when you went away even if there is a disaster you come back they solve the disaster was over there is nothing there what a waste of your time\nTo consume hours and hours and hours of nonsense especially when it's politically minded like you have the right wing and the left wing type CNN and Fox News type stuff is just mind boggling stupid\nUm sitcoms about the dumbest thing in the world right now there's just there's nothing you can learn from them you know what I was a kid there was cartoons in cartoons actually taught you something\nYou know nowadays you should con still teach you anything other than how to be a fool let's act a fool and let's do it on TV so everybody else will act to fool she's crazy stuff now\nWhat I'm saying to you is this if you get out there and you get going and you start paying attention to what's going on thinking about all the hours from five o'clock to ten o'clock before you go to bed maybe you go to bed earlier I don't go to bed until one or two o'clock usually but\nI'm I'm ... found that I'm not capable of learning past about nine nine thirty ten o'clock I started getting tired\nAnd the stuff doesn't go in as simply as it should\nBut think about how much warning you can accomplish and not only learning how much doing you could get done you see I don't have enough time to be successful I I'm busy no I don't even believe that a ... I just don't you're sitting on the couch a quiet desperation living in this life\nOf quiet desperation because you if he's elected to do that\nYou have decided it's no longer enough time to grow no longer enough time to get out there and make something happen for your family you or the one that's making that happen not someone else it's not real you're living a lie my friends\nI Know because I was living a lie but I was living it on purpose I was drinking 'cause I didn't really care\nWell stopping drinking only did one thing woke me up to [noise] what am I going to do now\nRight and I'm saying whatever you're doing right now but is paralyzing you you need to think why you're doing that yourself while you're putting yourself in that situation where you can't grow you can't have more\nThat you're not allowing yourself to do what's most important\nProducer for yourself and your family well\nTake a short break be right back with a dumpster radio [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]

[noise]\nRadio Welcome back you know here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One for each other\nMoms and back to\nDo all the way to show that they were talking about what are you doing with your life right now I mean I'm\nYou know the the whole thing that shouldn't be here the last couple of days is that um about three weeks ago I stopped drinking or what the hospital for procedure came back out and now it's like man\nIf I don't drink or do I do I'll tell you what to do I get back on the horse and start thinking about life again because I was ... myself out so I've been talking on the first two segments about what are you doing to numb yourself out to come home at night and stopped caring about life\nPicked those segments up if you just turn again to go to um\nThe website and get the podcast so I'm going to get off that topic to talk about another topic\nTo talk about what rich people do compared to poor and middle class people which are like I said the other day I was was this ... this guy said anybody who's middle class is really poor because all they think about is just basically getting by what can I earn what could I have well can I drive well can I live in\nYou know what kind of close kind of work what kind of watch do I have because it's just me me me me me and I would just basically starvation mode you know what what do I have and talk about the the poor middle class and the poor would just forget about I mean they're just completely lost\nBut the middle class people think that there somewhere\nAnd their idea is save a little pile of money\nRich people don't think about save a little pile of money rich people think completely differently\nAnd then poor and middle class people middle class people think about saving they think about structuring their consumption to be below what their income is\nWealthy people don't necessarily waste don't get me wrong many of them are frugal also but they don't focus on structuring\nTheir life to live below their means they focus their life on creating more income enrich said for dad cows Psaki said it pretty interested in the well you said my poor dad\nOr see how did he say to go see if I get this correct quote here or at least close enough that resemble his statement but he says his um his his for dad would say we can't afford that\nAnd his rich dad would say what do we need to do so that we can afford that that's a pretty clear explanation of the two different types of thinking\nAnd so wealthy people we go you know what I'd like to take our life up another notch let's go by another income producing asset\nLet's buy some more income\nPoor people instead say let's go buy some more debt let's go buy a car that we have to pay payments I'll buy a house we have to pay payments on let's buy stuff on credit cards we have teams so they're buying their debt is buying them payments\nAnd reducing the standard and quality of their life\nWhereas wealthy people are using their credit to go buy assets that are producing income and increasing the standard and the quality of their life no this is so blatantly different that if you're on the radio right now and you're listening to this or if you pick this up on a podcast later on guys\nYou've got to think to yourself which one of these and my\nMind that guy that just thinks oh my God\nHow can I save enough money to maybe put some money aside how can I get by how can I create a pile we'll call Billy's college fund and we'll call it an emergency fund and we'll call it a retirement fund\nRich people do do that rich people don't have pockets I don't have pockets of money I have cash\nThirty right thirty million in cash that can be spent where I Need to invest it to make the money I Need I don't have it in buckets it may\nBe in probably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's there and it's waiting for the next\nBig deal I don't want it there I Want it in a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings accounts but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest eagle boy that's incredible I could live off that the rest of all I'd go oh\nThat's terrible the rate of return on that investment is terrible now I go out and buy an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself cost me
