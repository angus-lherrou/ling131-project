{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "And you multiply that number by twenty five\nTo estimate how much you'll need to save a total based on what you'll need each year so if you're you've determined that you'll need about fifty thousand dollars each year during retirement multiply that by twenty five and you only roughly one and a quarter million dollars to comfortably retire\nWas twenty five come from actuarial tables\nWell it's just a rough estimate it's a rough estimate can yeah it's a rough estimate it just kind of giving people a guide post right and I think that's we're trying to make us up all kinds of people don't ya ya so keep that in mind when you're looking at the number of today's dollars\nSo by the way it is a guy plus we're ... factoring in several things right as the amount of money you'll need each year course the cost of health care inflation those kinds of things so [noise]\nWell like the last segment I said if you were Twenty years make fifty thousand dollars a year you have a million dollars you don't spend anything and then it was in same works on the other side when you retire if you think you can live up to ... thousand dollars a year it's not fifty thousand dollars a year 'cause you've got tax coming up\nWell that's right and so if you've got a million dollars even as an example you got taxes health care costs than inflation eating away at your money and eroding your capital so you just have to think about these things and so that's why we're trying to give people a little bit of a rough estimate a and a guiding post so\nIf you are say Twenty years by the way away from retirement and we assume and inflation rate at three percent per year we've been talking about that one and a quarter million dollars will be worth around two and a quarter million two thousand thirty eight being that that's how much you actually need to have saved in Twenty years\nAnd that being said it's much easier to calculate all your numbers in today's dollars and then as a last step convert them to inflation adjusted dollars to see how much you actually need\nSo they multiply by twenty five sort of rules because there was a rule of thumb if you will is based on the four percent rule and that's something that you know is arguably you know a good guy pose but not necessarily foolproof and I wouldn't necessarily use that as my\nFinal planning a measurement but the four percent rule was basically states that you can withdraw four percent of your nest egg during the first year of your retirement and then adjusted just that number each subsequent year for accounting for inflation so if you've ever wanted a quarter million dollar saved by the time of year retire four percent of that amounts to\nFifty thousand dollars a year that first year that if you increase your withdrawal right by three percent the next year of inflation you will drop fifty one thousand five hundred dollars that next year and so on and so on so keep that in mind as just guidelines not hard and fast rules again just to repeat that not hard and fast rules\nJust guidelines so you may need more or less money depending on your unique situation um for instance if you will require long term care and the future\nUh but this is a good way to start getting your head around you know at least putting yourself in the ballpark I'll put it that way so if it only investments also offers three simple steps to become a four one K. millionaire and you can kind of look down on their website but\nUh what if you can't save that much so as it is hearing that will take\nMore than a quarter of a million dollars he would have won a quarter million dollars to comfortably that can be pretty discouraging if you're starting to save\nAnd if you were having a hard time socking money away for retirement you're not alone a third of Americans have nothing at all save for retirement it's according to see the survey by a go banking race and more than half fifty six percent have less than ten thousand dollar save for retirement\nEven if you can't save a million dollars or more of the time he retired that doesn't mean you shouldn't save as much as you can during the time you have less so let's it's never too late to get started and you could still saved thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars if you're a strategic and if you're aggressive\nAh and you would say first start with that four one K. contribution get up to the match best you can also helping your savings on your tax savings bill tax bill for the year and while you can start also claiming benefits at sixty two for each month\nA Social Security you can also wait until your age Seventy you'll receive slightly higher and bigger checks and if you were also continue to work during those years that will give you even more time to save as well so you can work longer as an example and also help your retirement\nOr so just important things I think to keep in mind or for people as they're trying to calculate and think about is a million bucks going to be enough for many people that's not nearly enough I Know that but it's a nice round number that I think many people get sort of fool thinking look I Need to be a millionaire\nMillionaire isn't what it used to be on a million bucks won't buy what it used to be ... when it used to so to be able to withdraw\nDr ... of the factors that we want you to consider you're thinking about even if you have a million dollars a lot of that money's not yours\nIs tax money when you were all that money is going to IRS to just keep that in mind and also the healthcare costs and the costs of inflation and that really long term care those are all things that could chip away and eat away at your long term retirement nest egg so keep that in mind\nYou don't look Americans average Americans are we spend money on lottery tickets been about two hundred and fifty one dollars here wow with the return of fifty cents on the dollar that means the average person throws weigh about a hundred and Eighteen bucks on a successful lottery tickets not a great investment nope nope\nAnd more than five percent of lottery winners declare bankruptcy within five years of taking home the jackpot\nYou know the biggest state for a lottery madness is thinking well guess\nMm I don't know Massachusetts really more popular than any other states and people spend an average of six hundred and thirty four bucks wow you're going to play\nThat's real money where I come from yeah it's just a gambling yeah fifty ... yup ... take here you do if you're going to spend six hundred bucks a year just say this\nGo roll the were let we'll play one hand the blackjack your odds are better at wedding than doing the the lottery\nBut fifty three cents on the dollar that's the return\nYeah and that's if you win that's that's the average across the board but still you're still even to play it just like the casino you're not gonna be like yo does that as soon as well as people are winning all their money yeah you will break even ... you wouldn't three bucks here three bucks there\nAnd then when you do when the big one you're bankrupt within five years it just sounds too it was the last time you buy a larger yesterday [laughter]\n\n... would you say honestly a year on a large large I guess I I don't think that it's volume volume volume whether you're going to when you're gonna win by the grace of you know whatever it is yeah uh I don't think God wants to have me part of this but um if you do when you know a lot to do with some other\nUm you know so you have any bearing on yeah orchard luck so I think I think one dollar that's uh I play a dollar yeah\nBecause when the wind just once a year is what you're saying oh I Know well they got to play you use a buck whatever I'm buying where the year I go by bourbon I go into Libya\nYou buy that we learn about once a week ago [laughter] that's awesome editor website SPA well dot com check out the weekly newsletter and the return of survival guide all day you will is with ESPN money our\nGetting the data having accurate data which was so critical and I remember like talk about that and like if we can get good national data that going to be accurate there's no point do they do a lot of time\nTrying to find the ... or so for that data\n[noise] now we've got this situation set up to where people can try this software out for free is not true\nThat is correct yeah there's a seven day trial with just ...\nSo why don't you tell them how to locate that and then just kinda go over what they're going to see 'cause you're getting access to a lot more stuff than we started with in the beginning this is really different piece of software\nYeah that'd be happy to sell 'em uh gosh now I live on like a [laughter] what was the\n... lifestyle like every dot com\nYeah that's where you can go get rich by this kind of lifestyle dot com and there's a button right on that amount of an up and you can use that as much as you want to many evaluate she says she wants to um you know I'm sure on that for once you're on that trial\nMany software's I Believe charge you per um evaluation you run today not\nYeah in fact I'm be they they do and it's a real problem because I have to make that it takes about a hundred evaluations for each property that you actually purchased a because you have to find out you have to do the initial\nAnswer to that question to try to make an offer on the property and it looked like a good deal and yet or through through\nQuite a few property and you don't get every day of it but by the time actually purchased on the east than maybe a hundred evaluation and if you're paying by the evaluation can get very much so um and in fact\nThe one of the data that we use is called ... cause I our like every rental data provider in the country that nationwide data\nAnd by far and away they were the uh they had the best and it was amazing how accurate the rental day there was\nA problem or was that when you go to their website and want to purchase in about ... ... dollars for one just to evaluate one property um but we were able to work out a deal with them so that when people try to lifestyles discovery\nThey actually have unlimited access to many ran range evaluation as they need to have\n... so we've been able to eliminate that issue\n[noise] well if we had no but I don't think this thing would work because it's just too expensive to go out there that price now the other thing that I've seen other software programs uh require you to sign up for long periods of time six months to a year or whatever or we're not doing that are we\nCorrect where just saw were just doing a lot amount of having to use it when you get a subscription to download it and and now that they work really well for most of it they're not like in some kind of I'm kind of contract [noise]\nYour well it's absolutely um what's the word for it\nIt's been very beneficial for them and not very beneficial for us because it's mostly to sign up for his his low prices what we charge you've got to sign up for a period of time to make it worthwhile\nWords you're probably I Would probably say you divided up your ... your time as in looking for property you might spend a week or a month or two months of the most to go out and buy the property you want and then you kind of back off for a while and then you come back and say OK I'm ready to buy another one then you go back on again\nThe building for them to sign on and then stop and then sign on again\nIs a massive benefit that no one of the program that I Know of or I've ever heard of a is allowing people and I'm Wondering just out loud between two of us [laughter] that may be a problem some day I mean because of that that's something we're you know they'll sign up and it'll quit and they'll send them to quit and\n... where you have to really look at that but I Do find that a lot of people just keep their subscription because they pay people will be\nAnd I went in I look at the comparable and there's no way to property worth a hundred thousand because all the copper bowls or like a hundred and Fifteen hundred thirty thousand dollars and so you know the soccer stadium on making a huge mistake and you go in and pay too much\nThe property but that day that the ... and I'm confident you know the fine sales value and the red value is so helpful because you know you get like a Ninety five percent confident on the wrist by all of your dad you know worried about are still very ...\nYou know I remember reading an article once and it was a long time ago so don't remember the exact percentages are so I welcome you to look it up on the Internet to verify what I'm saying a for everybody who's listening but I had read this article words Zillow had gotten the suit\nBecause people were making decisions on on data that was not accurate and ... had to come back and part of the restitution was to admit\nThat they were like only Ninety they're they're like Ninety five percent inaccurate in other words if they said it's worth a hundred and ten thousand dollars\nThere is a Ninety five percent chance the wrong not right but raw some astronomical but no I don't know if that meant they were wrong by one dollar or one hundred and five dollars evolve what I'm saying like Ninety five percent of the data was wrong that was just blew my mind\nThat I probably should look that up for a state that but I'm I'm welcome you to look it up and see how close I came to that are yeah I\nBut I think I heard about that and it's a it's been a problem and and and then my you know when we were evaluating that\nProject a year ago and I was starting to get data from different providers\nAnd I was working at a lamp if I were a parrot too and my last day at a ... you know all these different parts of it and as bill was consistently\nAnd you know off of what a what the numbers but I think it'd be really careful I mean at a professional investor should not be used in free data to\nTo do their evaluation\nOr they'll is really good you know they get paid for your for oh about the age of ... that's a great business model the company that we're getting data from they get paid because of the ... the data provided and so\nYou know institutional investors and private investors and bankers cetera argues the data that we have available much of a hurry\nOr well I Want to thank you for coming up we're coming up to a break here uh lifestyles discovery dot com take your free seven day trial offer

on the radio show um today I'd like to discuss with you I'm this concept of savings for retirement or saving for retirement and how much the average family has said\nNow I read this article is really good article had a lot of data I'm not going to try to go through all the data but I can tell you some basic concepts the younger people are the less they have said that's a simple one you know the older you get the more people have said because they had a longer period of time to save [noise]\nUm [noise] but there seems to be a\nDifferentiation here in data and I'm going to have to see if I can go through this with ... says retirement accounts savings are inadequate in an equal retirement savings of families age thirty to sixty one\nRight I'm for makes thirty two to sixty one are different than what the other ages are so that that piece of material right there to really nothing for ... years to the real interesting part they're talking about\nThe means savings of all families so if you take the mean what is the main the main says if you add up everything and abide by the number of people in the uh survey if you add up everybody's retirement in Dubai\nBy the number of people survey that the meaning is Ninety five thousand seven hundred and Seventy six dollars now they go on in this long article to explain that that's almost an ill relevant number because the people on the bottom have almost nothing and the people on the top have massive amounts of\nMoney saved up so they talk next about the median savings with families that have retirement savings so you look at the median is if you were to take\nA number if you'd late all the numbers outlet in a row and you found the very center of all the numbers from the lowest\nTo the highest and I'll say if you found the center\nThe center is sixty thousand dollars so the average person from the fifty percent out bracket down has less than sixty thousand dollars but actually if you only take people that have retirement savings if you do the same thing with people that do not have retirement savings\nAnd you take the media and again the media and drops to five\nThousand dollars so think about if you took every American out there that was entering retirement age\nAnd you line them up on a roll out along street maybe I ten freeway from one side of the country the other and you went to the halfway point\nTo the halfway point half of all Americans and below have only five thousand bucks saved up that's pretty scary when you think about it if you take out the people that have zero savings and you do the same line up\nHalfway down the line half of all people that have you been tried to save only have sixty thousand dollars now that is on believable\nJust unbelievable that anybody out there fifty percent of the whole country has five thousand or less the people actually believe in savings who have saved ... percent of the country only had sixty thousand how could you retire on sixty thousand dollars\nI have no idea how they even think that that's going to work\nIt blows my mind now [noise]\nWhen you're at age to that it\nReally skews the numbers because elderly people have way more savings and younger kids etc etc etc says you go through the age groups [noise] they were charged here by age group\nAnd what you'll see is that there are different age groups that believe differently in saving so if you get to the age group the working age group of thirty two to sixty\nOne do you find that the the mean that we talked about of Ninety five thousand dollars but if you look at the people from fifty sixty sixty one in other words not the whole group of working class people right now but only people from fifty sixty sixty one the last five years quote unquote\nTheir average or they're mean as a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars\nI'm Sorry a hundred and sixty three thousand to do with my bad or if you go from fifty to fifty five hundred and twenty four thousand um and it goes down precipitously from that point on as you get younger and younger and younger [noise] um", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston",
