{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "But uh you know Colorado it's a it's a good time of year the weekend before fight uh when I heard it was to a two foot of snow so I'm Glad I didn't go that\nBut you know one of the things is just a sit in a in a you know your client's home\nYou've gotten them and help them to retirement and now they're enjoying you know retirement especially a beautiful view anyone has ever seen the mountains and Colorado knows how amazing that can be but it's nice to go see that side but you know there's a lot of things they did a right to get there okay\nAnd you know working with a with both of these families I mean I can tell you a lot of the characteristics and things they did right and I saw I thought I'd share well let's let's talk about some of the things we need to get right what are the mistakes we don't want to make and I think the first one\nOr what you don't want to do is is not following a budget and I think that's so simple sometimes\nOr in your mind but they're really stick with the budget or to follow it through and you know again to check it and now how often do you check it out depending ah you know this individual one of them probably checked it every day as this monster spreadsheet follows trash that can tell you trends that's a that's a little excessive\nAnd I don't think anyone has to be that excessive because the other client is probably one that looks at it on a monthly basis I think that's pretty normal um I think now things are occupied check all that more but I think a monthly basis of following the budget and again you divided into two\nLooking at discretionary expenses and non discretionary expenses and it kind of divide that out and and then look at what percentage or you know those in each on a month to month basis and if you're discretionary expenses are growing pretty substantial then guess what that's where you can cut cut that back put that into savings\nBut each of these families I could tell you were very diligent and following the budget\nSitting down to communicate in it and making it ... and I think that's one reason they're successful and enjoying a beautiful retirement in Colorado\nNow the other thing is I Would tell you you got to be careful I think sometimes say well I'll just rely on Social Security when I get the retirement outlets Social Security take care of me now I don't think today many people are probably a saying that much like they used to but still rely on Social Security I think many of us are looking to rely on Social Security so in ... in reality\nWe see right now ... a Social Security probably will only replace on average about forty percent of the average aren't as pre retirement income so\nMost folks they're going to need roughly double that live on in retirement so\nTherefore you don't have a lot in your IRA if you don't have a lot in your four one K. or you might want to consider postponing retirement and extending your career until you have a better cushions that is one thing working longer um or that can end up boosting or I Would tell you this\nIf you have the way to increase your income stream if you have the assets delayed taking Social Security\nThis is one it seems like it's almost an obvious answer yet people fight this more than anything else um I think we're successful in getting people to a sixty six which is the uh now the average age of retirement but saying wait till Seventy\n... why would you want to wait so if you're if you're thinking well why would I Want to wait till eight Seventy well eight percent increase in your pay I mean where are you getting a percent right now risk free me think about history rates around the world\nWhere you're going to get eight percent today is not where you're gonna want to put your money but you're getting eight percent increase so if you have that ability in model that out\nYou know one of the things we do with our clients as we sit down and we do a Social Security max musician report we have experts here that no Social Security matter of fact I remember laying a a arguing with the Social Security office on behalf of a client and said they were dead wrong and their calculation so we got money back for the client\nAnd just because she did the report so my point is if you're not looking\nAt something that looks at your age is your life expectancies you know break even ages are things depending on your dynamic you know the age gap between you and your spouse or your your income today if you're still working in a retirement\nAll those are going to be variable ... do not sit there and say well I'm going to do what my neighbor did or my friends did because we all like to get in social support we like to get a validation right we like the validation and are and what we're doing in our decisions well you're not your neighbor your not your friend that dynamic may be completely different\nAnd you may cost herself a lot of money so do a report this not emotionally biased or biased by any means\nAnd figure that out so again that's a big factor in\nWe did both Social Security ... reports for for the call out to Colorado and the other one I'll say if you have a pension we did the same pension analysis you know a lot of us if we're lucky ... pensions okay so if you're still one of the lucky ones you know you get the option of the lump sum whichever advisors going to say hey just to take the lump sum\nThey get to manage it for you that's not necessarily the best thing for you\nWe show the same thing is it better to take the lifetime annuity for a one life or you know joint life one hundred percent certain you guys have benches and other choices I'm Talking about\nDid you have a tool that you're looking at to make that decision so that's one of the uh this gentleman happened to have to pensions he kept one as a pension payout because it was it the the percentage that he was making then there would be far to beat if you try to invest in the market today and then all the other one it was so low that you would be better off invested in that so\nThat's how this tool helps him make that decision not just some random decision that most people do or an advisor this is going to tell you take the lump sum because he wants to manage your money\nSo I said the other thing is in both the big concern even though these families I'll tell you they've done very well in saving they're still concerned about long term care\nAnd both of them have the long term care insurance one had a the traditional that was through his company but the other individual has you know a newer policy that you've seen insurance companies come out with which you can deposit assets and if you don't use it for a long term care well the good news like a traditional insurance you don't pay every month if you don't use the illusion\nWork work work work work and you get a job and\nI'm willing to say that many of us went through multiple stages of work that we're all part of the same stage\nWhat is the stages of believe that you're going to make it inside of somebody else's time capsule inside of somebody else's spaceship you're going to work inside of somebody else's business and somehow that's going to make you successful where's the guy or gal that owns a business is becoming mug mega multi rich\nAnd I say that because you can't even conceive the difference between working in a business and actually owning a business and did a I'm going to go through that by the way this is a a tease if you'll stick with me through the whole show I'm gonna take you through the kinds of money you can make a single family small apartments medium apartments large apartments were going to go through\nThis growth process uh which is a natural growth process of a real estate investor and show you how life changes but what I Want to frame this with\nIs that there is a life cycle\nThat fits around some of this stuff and maybe you can change the dates of the life cycle like we have some young students that came in here John ... comes to mind is came here around twenties I think\nBy the time he was mid to late twenties already own apartment complexes now he's in his early thirties and I'm sure he's a mega millionaire by now on multiple multiple apartment complexes\nAre so he changed the ... the dates that the times structure when he got into entrepreneur realism and really skip working for somebody else he never really had a job he came out of\nHigh school is dad asking do you want to go to college or do you want to start a business and he elected to start a business so he skipped the one that most of us get stuck in for most of our lives so let's look at this one here we are\nGetting up every day I was working twelve hours a day six days a week\nOr getting up every day and going to work out before I worked at the health club which actually like even though it was twelve hours a day six days a week I worked in finance company so I learned a lot about finances and money in loans and debt and all this stuff working in the finance company but it was the most boring job and the whole I remember sitting there watching the clock tick away\nThinking man when do I get outta here so I could go do something in life it's worthwhile\nBut I quit that and eventually became a truck driver\nAnd as a truck driver I go boy this is just hell on wheels man this is the worst life in the world get up at four o'clock in the morning load your truck drive around and unload stuff all day long you get done you know four o'clock after you have to unload trucks clean your truck there are five six o'clock at night exhausted\nNo energy to go out and live your life to exercise fitness or anything so I had to give that job up I got rid of that one very quickly and then I said you know what\nIf I'm going to live a life of hell if I'm going to get up every day and be miserable and work all day long at least let me do it in something I enjoy doing so I went to work at a health club which is really\nMy hobby was bodybuilding power lifting Olympic lip and so when I went in the health club at least I liked what I did most of the day\nIt was interesting there were some things I didn't like like I didn't like to sell had to learn how to sell memberships that wasn't something was to power or to\nPositive at the time although I learned to do it and learn to do it well it was something that I had to wrap my arms around because any business they want you to do things sometimes those things are ethical sometimes they're not ethical\nSometimes they're relevant sometimes they're not relevant and you know when you're doing them you're wasting your time that this is a gigantic waste of my life\nAnd I did that for twelve years but during that time had all kinds of other aspirations I Won a contest power lifting body building contest during that time\nSo I was able to keep my mind\nStayed off by just by going out here and saying what's important to me in life is is these bodybuilding trophies you know and I I I joke about the trophy stop the trope the trophy means absolutely nothing got tons of them from both Olympic lifting power lifting body building\nA and other things I've WON Awards at just about everything I've ever done I've always strive to be the best I could be at\nAn deal wards are really nothing\nExcept the representation that you put forth forth\nPut forth all one hundred percent of your effort to accomplish something where everybody else just sits life out they sit on the sidelines and they produce the minimum necessary to get by\nAnd I think that's important to realize that when you're living that life of mediocrity when you're living the life of quiet desperation getting up and going to work every day and that's what was to me and I truly believe I don't care who you are\nThat's what it is to you you're living alive a quiet desperation you've got nothing in your life to get up and look forward to yeah you've got something to get up and do\nThat has to be done I get that but you have really nothing to live for there's no future being built for you there's no growth process there is no end all be all result it's going to change your life position at the end of all that it's just\nYep we're getting on that little wheel and that little mouse cage and running a little we'll round and round and round we'd go wherever\nWe stop nobody knows that's the kind of thing that I see happening to people and as you go through that and you see these things happening to people you realize that they don't see it\nThat's the problem when I was in it I felt that many of you are in it and you feel it but I don't think you see it\nMy goal why I've been put on this earth is to get out the message they stop feeling it and start singing we'll be right back with the Dell wildly radio\nShow [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're

equity capture thousands of dollars you create when you have a regime and by the white property using them right map\nAs like propped up in this alcohol which is interesting was is that I started eating something at night that I've never eaten before I started being like fruit and nuts and stuff stuff that we normally think is healthy\nBut\nWhat I realized is all that stuff kind of stuff that irritates something called dire ridiculous or something like that ... stomach disease and the test and disease where there's Powell ups and stuff and all that stuff got much at all of a sudden I had ...\nA um [noise]\nEvent you know hurt and it hurt really bad so I went to the hospital emergency room and they took X rays and said yeah you've\nGot a hole in your chest and so now I'm sitting here in the hospital for six days ... massive medication like living on water liquid diet jello that kind of stuff [laughter] I'm just sitting there going to like\nYou know number one I'm so happy to have to worry about my businesses my money my finances or whatever that I had the time and the energy to be able to take care of stuff like this\nBut was it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out soon but it's a drain to train all of the infected materials out of my body and won all kinds of antibiotics\nBut I feel great don't get me wrong I

and\nSomewhere along the lines you are going to have to break through that just like I have to break through and it's a parallel conversations I had to believe I Believe that I was gonna die by sixty five\nAh you know my dad my grandfather my grandfather died by sixty five I had cousins in ads that died but in their forties so I never really believed to have much more time than eight sixty five to get it done but now I'm sitting here looking at myself saying look\nHere I Am sixty two years old I've already blown out Monday of already tore off my biceps already tore off my triceps of already broken my elbow up already ... ripped out my rotator cuff in my shoulder I've already injured my back broken my tail bum a broke my leg\nAnd now I have to meet you or whatever it is something to meet you as I have diabetes at this at that if I laugh and say everything's supposed to be high on my chest is low whenever there's supposed to be lower my tests as high\nMedication all takes care of that and here I Am sixty two years of age going you know what I feel great there's absolutely no way I'm going to die by age sixty Bible if somebody hits me with a car or truck or a fall out of a plane or something crazy happens because as my body parts keep falling off the natural process of you to get old\nThey keep putting them back on\nI'm going to a birthday party for my uncle now unlike the rest of my family my uncle never smoke my uncle is going to be eighty years old that is a new goal for me\nNow my goal change from sixty five I got a new goal my goal is to live to eighty but now is I think about living to eighty I started thinking what am I going to do with myself\nTo live day to age eighty you gotta ask yourself you know where you're at your dynamic and what I Want to get across to use that want to get across to you that when I started\nBuying real estate it was because I knew that I needed a business that paid me ... me working for the money my money was working for me so I went out and bought single family houses I made about two hundred dollars a month positive cash flow any child when I first started I bought over a hundred houses I ended up with about ten grand a month of positive cash flow\nThat was tax free\nTen grand them up was way way way more than I was making in my job I made Seventy grand a year after taxes I was bringing home probably thirty five hundred four thousand a month and year I was making ten thousand dollars a month there was a no brainer for me to quit my job I make more money in real estate that I did my job\nNow for you you have to think about that I had to break the seal\nI had to step outside of my comfort zone and go by an asset and get a mortgage and go into debt and learned to manage a red house I didn't have lifestyles are limited to teach me how to do it I didn't have any mentors I read some books that you know I took some\nTook some video courses but they were pretty shabby to be honest with you back then but still I had my way through it ended up with a hundred houses then\nI decided to get rid of the hundred houses start buying apartment complexes and I bought small apartment complex I remember having attenuated apartment complex was making me two thousand dollars a month I was making two hundred dollars a month and each unit will see two hundred a month types and those two thousand dollars a month twenty four thousand a year tax free\nWas phenomenal I did almost nothing to run this ten years it was simple and I was making additional two thousand dollars a month tax free then I went out and bought myself\nA from the twenty I went and bought a thirty unit the thirty unit was making me tremendous amount of money three thousand four thousand bucks a month something like that are in now I was making more money\nYou know tax free that I was making you know ever at my job by double that it went on about a forty\nUnit made some money and then I went and bought a sixty sixty four unit was really the that was the ... that was the turning point for everything the sixty four unit was making me about ten thousand dollars a month by itself forget about all the other stuff\nThis one property I put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars down to buy that today you'd probably have to put", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city":
