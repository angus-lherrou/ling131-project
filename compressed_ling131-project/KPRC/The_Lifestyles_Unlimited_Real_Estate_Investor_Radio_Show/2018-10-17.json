{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "A big lump sum of money that's supposed to generate income is supposed to generate returns for me and I take that out of the equation and I go pay down that house okay and you know what sometimes you look at the outcomes and if it's not material a lot of people decide well I'm going to pay off my home but sometimes we find out if you take that big chunk out now\nUm it could put you in the situation and there could be a gap down the road and the last thing anyone wants to do is be age Ninety and Ninety five and find there in the scenario that they're out of money so\nI Know that ... that's one of the things I think about but the whole mortgage interest is tax deductible okay taxpayers must itemize to get to break in fewer will now so you know Congress has now basically doubled\nThe standard deduction so Congress the joint committee on taxation estimates Thirteen point\nEight million households will benefit from the mortgage interest deduction this year and that's compared to more than thirty two million last year okay so things have changed\nSo even if you have I think now um if it's over was over five hundred thousand dollars anything over that doesn't count as well so we're seeing that affect the top and mortgages so the mortgage interest deduction isn't what it used to be so these are things that hopefully you're having\nThis discussion which are tax accountant or but it may not be worth to keep that interest adoption so therefore that's another thing to kind of consider as you're trying to make that decision\nBut to cover mortgage payments retirees frequently have to withdraw more for their retirement funds then they would if the mortgage was paid off so this is why maybe a goal\nIf you are probably a good distance from retirement may get a goal if you have that cash flow and you have in bonuses and things at the end of the year or you get instead of I'm\nSpending it right put that towards the mortgage so make it a goal to not have a mortgage once you're in retirement but I think if you find yourself too close to retirement\nAnd you're going to make the decision at taking a big chunk in the lump sum out that might not be the best idea and you better make certain that I wouldn't make certain in many different ways and there's nothing better than a good financial plants so some people have enough in savings and investments and retirement funds to pay off their mortgage loans no problem they can write the check\nBut I think many would have to take a sizeable chunk of those assets and that could lead them short on cash for emergencies\nFuture living expenses so you know before you do this exercise in the financial plan you better also consider a long term care of an a\nOh so that I Hope you're not just looking at your assets growing at a five and six percent and low inflation numbers make sure you put historical inflation in there and put healthcare scenarios in there and then after that you want to add the scenario is taken out your mortgage and taking a chunk out of your retirement and that still shows that you're in good standing\nThan you know what that might be a good decision for you I think a lot of times people do they go on these websites\nAnd they go to these quick calculators and they make these assumptions of growth they don't factoring they bear market they don't factor in a market draw down they don't factor in a flat markets so these are all scenarios you gotta look at so not the rosy scenario that hey I make seven percent every single year\nAnd I can pay off my mortgage now what about the years you make no money would would have things are flat so at the end of the day I think you really need to take the time because that's a big decision I mean that's one of the biggest expense is\nAll of us have is is going to be paying a mortgage and you know what the lure of low interest rates has done what most people is probably cause most people to take on a little bit more house than they would have before and we noticed a all across the board so sometimes that are now that new house at the cost is a bigger chunk of your retirement so at the end of the day\nYou know I think you really need to take time because these big withdraws can put you into a a a one which are tax bracket I mean think about this where are you taking that money from I had someone tell me well I Want to pay my house off and I'll just take it for my for one came like hold on a second\nYou're going to throw yourself in a much higher tax bracket now if you want to do that\nLet's make it a goal over the course of the next five years and we'll keep your right under that bracket so you're not bumped up to the next so those are other scenarios uh that you might want to consider I've seen people say well let me take my uh my joined account it's already been tax well you're not quite to the age where you can start taking out of your\nFour oh one k.'s and stuff so what's gonna happen if you have an emergency or you have a cash crunch you have no liquidity so these are all just little nuances to consider but at the end of the day I think that uh the best case scenario sit down with a plan or and run multiple scenarios and hopefully have give me some decent ideas that do that and then if the case you know what at the end of the day\nIf psychologically will feel good ... and you and your plants shows that you can do it didn't go ahead and do it and that's kind of the advice we normally get\nSo anyway it's just a good talking to the question we get all the time it's I'm surprised how many times we get that question but we do\nWhat you got Tom Selleck now doing reverse mortgage commercials hey well magnum yeah okay that's not a bad gotta you gotta most guys like that you still have the most ashes and not very live without\nMuch he's still a good looking guy with a new magnum PI and so they're doing the show I I Can't\nThink of anything creative terrible we actually shows and many of these movies but think about even things like a human course Netflix just report earnings I'll say where did that for a moment think of the original content coming out of that place\nYeah kill ... shows that they're having trouble evil but then yeah you you dredge up Hawaii Five o magnum PI another round uh Roseanne\nI mean without Roseanne without power without but whatever agenda reach read and then we can think of it are better than others superhero movie eye to eye but more than half of the superhero movies like I didn't know that was a superhero what about the grid that I'm a superhero I was at a villain have no idea what has been um\nYou know what that I was thinking about anything that I mean they lost ...\nI mean yeah I mean if it was the what was the the hall of ah what was the hall of was the hall of what it was Superman I'll just I'll just if you weren't in the ... justice yeah I don't even know if you really qualified whether they just bring back the greatest American Hero did you remember that movie that was but he was not in the whole ... terrible shove\nImagine having a piece of marble or DC Comics yeah you got in on it you know decades ago and now while I don't know but the ... you know I don't like that I you know and I liked the acted yeah\nHe's a movie cool they just can't get creative but no ... ... ... dynasty again the same there's an old ...

mean uh we have a better demographic stories and they do in many parts of Western Europe frankly a which is a good thing and we do take in\n[noise] people that come into the country when\nWe look at

called zero five six one and ...\nFrom the gallery British roommate did America studio\n...\nAnd so we we emphasize the education up front once they get through that thirty day and Dr nation it includes some video learning a come into some road trip so they can start to learn some of the lingo and at what we're talking about\nUh then they come to either Curtis awry here in Houston and we start to map out for them what is it that you're trying to do do you want to buy a twenty in a deal by yourself or a forty at a deal by yourself\nAre you employed you're happy and you're just trying to look for a better way to invest your money as a passive and we start to map out you know how we're going to take them from where they are to where they want to be in five years that is really a goal setting and financial planning\nFor them [noise] and um what kinds of questions that they come up with it's just you know as you age where you do is let me ask you rephrase the question is are a pattern to it I Know when I was consulting\nThere were always patterns you know there was maybe five or ten different things people want to do and they pick one or two those patterns did you find that\n... yeah I Would say so and I've seen several different things so my first person I met with actually had five single family houses that he had purchased on his own before finding lifestyles and he heard a better way on the right from the radio show on how it could be doing what he's doing and decided to\nCome and join up and and get a little deeper and things he had a pathway he thought when he came to me actually came to me for multi family counseling but as I looked at what he was doing and what is Gulf War I realized that he knew what he was\nA single family and we certainly have plenty of members who have gone from one to I don't know what our\nTopic is I think I heard somebody has fifty or maybe even a hundred\nOr single families out there and they've got an unbelievable system for how to run those things and I realized that this guy for what he wanted to achieve he was already halfway there and I said I could I don't know single family\nBut I can tell that you could be where you want to be any year just by doubling down on what you've already done and with what he told me that the money had to invest was I said I think it'll take you longer to get there\nGoing the multi family route but I'll be happy to take you there that's really what you want to do and are made him rethink what he wanted to do and and so that was one thing that happened the common thing I think is passive investors who are trying to figure out how to juggle getting involved with lifestyle while\nWorking in the job that they enjoy it and as you know paying for it to themselves and their lifestyle as it is and these are always conservative people they're like minded as we are they're just looking for a better way to do a kind of what they're already doing and\nI really find myself emphasizing to them that I call this a contact sport and that is you've got to get involved you've got to get to our parents and meet other people doing it because they will accelerate your ability to get involved in deals to do your own deal whatever it is that they're trying to do\nAnd the three people that I can reference uh that are already up and running as passes and are going to be closing on their first deal within maybe by the end of this month I think\nUm those are people that took that advice and they started showing up at the road trips the case studies I started shaking hands meeting people that were doing deals and uh got caught up in a very quickly\nNow one of the themes I ran into and I don't know if we run into this as much anymore and you've only been here six days so maybe you haven't been through a large enough cycle yet to see this happening but one of the things I used to run into all the times got somebody come to me and say\nYou know I Want to do single family but then they went on a road trip and we next week they called back you know just change my mind after seeing what is on the road trip I Want to be ... family\nAnd you know the a week later the sailboat it started out as the past have been in a week after that to come back because now you know what after seeing this I think I could do this to I Want to be and I wrote a you know and then come back into you know what I'm looking for these smaller deals that they just couldn't go ahead and go up to be not you know\nI'm a lead investor you run into any vast solutions yet [noise]\nAh yeah the one that I'm working on they actually came into the passes but there are retired and they have seen enough now where they're going you know what we could do and we have the money to do a forty deal order maybe we should start doing that\nBecause they're ah they're kind of being picky which uh don't blame him for probably not a bad idea on who they invested with and and that cycle takes time to understand what makes a good partner for your specific situation\nAnd finding somebody that has the same goals are is on the same track you are and uh yeah so they're swinging back around now and we started talking about them just doing their own deal and part of that actually was me telling them look I've already got two people that are by twenty minutes and this is just happened in the last you know forty five days\nSo uh they realize that that could happen a little faster and uh and I think you know sometimes you just got to push people off cliff once I get to the edge\nAnd ah so I I think those that couple will go that way but all the other cycle she I don't think I've been around quite long enough to see the transition that you have a twenty seven years or however long you been doing this\nWell the next one is um a more difficult question I'm you've done some due diligence so far\n[noise] yeah we actually did a deal a Monday ten days ago now um for a guy he's actually out of central Texas a but the deal is in a camp which actually false and our Houston a territory so it came to me\nUh we went on site didn't know I'd never stopped capital I've driven through it on my way to fishing trips down on the coast but I've never stopped there so I got to go down there for a day they had done a nice job of pre shopping the market we walked all the units are had some contractors they're looking at everything to decide how much work\nNeeded to be done on it for going in so they knew how to properly budget for any deferred maintenance and things like that gets thing often it's dark\nAnd I'm actually I just got a text from two minutes before we got on air here and he wants to talk this afternoon he's read on his business analysis and he wants me to take a look at it and\nKind of play devil's advocate on what he was destined whether I take the deal still work or not\n[noise] well I think there's probably a good place to take a break we'll pick that up on the other side also when we come\nBack we'll discuss this guy has to do just disgusts say yes or no to deal with them we'll be right back with Scott been offering the dome ... radio

hear what's going on does what has changed\nYou know the uh I I think I've heard you use this phrase that's very true the uh thing that can keep a lot of people away from a great life as having a really good one\nHand I think ah when you and I had that conversation I was having a a very good life I um [noise]\nYou know I was always pretty financially conservative and getting out of college at Twenty one twenty two twenty three years old I Would give money magazine and read it cover to cover the day it showed up I Do all the little worksheets that they put in there on how much money you need to retire and all that sort of stuff and [noise]\nAnd my first job out of college I immediately went after Eighteen percent I was donating to the four oh one K. to really get ahead of that thing I didn't believe Social Security was going to be around and I wouldn't count not at forty five years later [noise]\nUm and I one of those worksheets set a number how much I needed to retire and a couple of years ago we refinanced my first two deals and had to sit down I only redo my personal financial statement to really look at all that stuff when they make me\nTo get a loan done and I did my a deal in a way you know what\nI'm over my number now what do I do I do I quit or I'm too young really to to totally quit but you know these things will keep throwing off cash flow for as long as I keep all and I thought\nNow's the time to start focusing on the lifestyle issues and stop worrying about money uh so I really didn't have a need for more deals I didn't need them to feed my ego I didn't need them to feed my family\nOr anything like that and I also at that same time two years ago I had my first two I have twins and there'll be juniors in college and a couple of weeks here are but they got into college and I realized it didn't hurt me as bad as I expected it to um\nHaving that extra money going out so uh so I really I I was wondering what I Do next what what I Do for an encore and uh [noise] at some point and this really a leads into why Mitt lifestyles now back\nAround New Year's I'm not a big New Year's resolution guy um but I had said you know what I Need to ... and\nIt just so happened about that time a deal kind of fell into my lap that's the one I did back in April and about the same time John Ridgway came to me and said hey I'm\nMoving up to support this national effort that lifestyle just got to have your taking my job [laughter] and\nI don't know if you know this but I turned him down twice a day when he came to me no I didn't know that event yeah and then he eventually ... Curtis on me and and you do know that Curtis and I started in the gallery of pretty much together about the same time so we used to have lunch once a week and compare notes and help each other out and\nUh we haven't been doing that he's got busy doing his thing and and doing the lifestyle mentor thing as a I don't know too much for two years ago when he took the shop\nAnd uh I got to do on my ideal and Curtis called me and said come on man will be like old times of need your help [laughter] so ah he's the one that really convinced me to to take the position\nAnd uh yeah it's it's just been a real commitment and um and at the same time I'm doing more of the things that I Know that I used to enjoy helping people tending road trips things like that I kind of falling off the map uh for the lifestyles are things for a while there and\nIt's got to be reinvigorated re involved and uh and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for them it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open and you know decide which ones you want to do\nAbsolutely now I Want to throw in another ... along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which I knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you found this deal out eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not going to guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
