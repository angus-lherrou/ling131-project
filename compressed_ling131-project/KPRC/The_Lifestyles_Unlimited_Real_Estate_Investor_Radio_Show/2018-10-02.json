{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "And so this is more real time I think maybe even not saying it's going to be Italian financial crisis but I Do think it's countries like this they're going to be the first catalyst you see ... of Italian bonds have revived a lot of the concerns about what many referred to as this doom loop between week lenders and fragile government finances and this year\n... banks of load up on the country's bonds but then you have the recent fall right and that has a road of the sectors capital ... and that is needed to protect it from future financial shocks they have very thin room to run here and the maneuver\nAnd investors have been selling off Italian shares in government bonds and after the government's significantly widened its budget deficit surprise we've been talking about that quite a bit here in the United states but they significantly widened their deficit target for next year or two point four percent of gross domestic product\nSetting up a clash of you will between does that help fund their government the European Union\nUm\nAnd themselves their internal government so the yield on the tenure Italian bonds rose\nToday to three point four percent that was from two point nine percent on Monday and while the year on to your bonds rose to one and a half percent one to one and a half percent from one percent you'll move\nAnd virtually the prices keep the minds of the prices are coming down and the banks of the area to watch and Italy they're holding a considerable considerable amount of Italian government bonds and as the value of those things sink the banks come under pressure and so you know you see\nThe ... vast majority of the economic problems here um they somebody claim would be proved if they had their own currency and not dealing with the euro\nBut of course many people are dealing with trying to stay with the euro\nHoldings of government a dead in Italy\nBy local banks increased by twelve percent this year to three hundred and Seventy five billion euros in August according to data from European Central bank Italian sovereign debt now make up more over ten percent of lenders total assets Italian banks hold more local debt than their peers across Europe\nBanks buy government bonds and they do so to act as a financial buffer four times of stress but these bombs are going down\nIn price and it's beginning to get more pressure on these banks and the banking system in Italy and therefore the European Union\nSo these are the countries in some cases that we've talked about this is another recent example that might serve as the example to us what may happen if we don't get these things together and get ourselves on a better course for two for fiscal a sustainability so how bad would a debt crisis be\nWill be pretty horrific in fact for two reasons first none of the powerful stabilization instruments that the euro area has\nDeveloped over the last few years could be deployed to rescue Italy so you see that we following the crisis related downgrades ... ... we would no longer be eligible for the European Union's quantitative easing bond purchasing program\nSo the ... ISI be essentially the European Central bank would stop accepting Italian\nBonds as collateral that would be problematic basically be forced to exit the euro or exit the euro zone and then secondly there's Italy's interconnectedness and size with the ISI be using all available tools to limit contagion you have the euro most survive\nA the the euro might survive and Italian leaving or they say unlike the Brexit telex sick is that right\n[noise]\nBut it's easy to talk about it till exit the doom loop yeah the doom loop cheered up a little bit mayor it up\nThank you yeah so but as an exit within the last but Italy the euro zone area economy and the European Union in deep distress [noise] so it would be bad\nTo put it mildly horrific to put it probably more accurately and this is going to be very difficult and I know many times we hear that these debt issues or become reality uh but it never seems to happen\nFor most of these larger countries because there's always a bailout there's always a and escape hatch there's always a loophole that you know al will make an exception this time of the European Union will come in to save them at at some point the European Union largely is gonna be made up [noise]\nI mean there's lots of who pays into the system really is Germany mostly and some of France [noise] so they're basically saying look in order to keep this European Union together will we the taxpayer continue to bail out these other\nCountries like Greece and the and Germany and France have their own problems\nThey've got many of their own issues and so you have a conflict between the euro zone and what would take place in some sort of a financial crisis or deeply in debt crisis\nUh or recession there and the willingness of taxpayers and people in other parts of the euro zone particularly get in Germany and France to bail out all these other countries that are\nIn financial\nMess there are a natural mess to be sure so we're not only in we're not the only ones in this camp in fact as I said before relative to GDP the United states is\nNot as bad off as many of these other countries around the world a but there's gotta be something that gets to a country that's large enough that's just going to make a a a larger impact so hopefully the United states can withstand some of this but as\nMany things as the globalization has taken effect we impact each other we're not as the couple of days I think we used to be\nOr people feel like we are so um you know United States used to represent nearly fifty percent global GDP is about forty five forty six percent of global global GDP about Thirty years ago today it's about twenty five percent\nSo you know we have this decoupling at a slowing down and some of the economic manufacturing data and other parts of the world developed and the emerging world China's specifically we talked yesterday about therapy and my numbers contraction is anything below fifty there at fifty\nAnd some of the trade issues there might be impacting them and so it's at the end of the day um we'll\nAll we're doing is kicking the can down the road with more death that's what we're doing your accumulating more deficits in more debt and what would that mean and I think it's going to have an enormous impact later on and by the way\nWe've not been loading up on cash we've not suggest that people get out of us equities in fact just the opposite stay committed to bond stay committed to us at least for now but we're just talking about some of the things that keep you need to sort of keep that\nOne I if you will on what's going on was dead and look out for because it's going to be happening one day and a dish so we're not buying gold\nAnd say you know should be but we have done that a long long long time so I Hope that just gives a little credibility to that it's not a doomsday story but it is a real risk story and something that people have to\nConsider a as they're investing and planning for their financial future they glistening had website sta wealth dot com you can listen to the SPA money out\nEven listening to it for entertainment purposes and you know\nAnd you can make money when you

[noise]\nTurns out jewelry shop and makes people nervous did you know that well you know why 'cause\nA lot of times jewelry overprice you go in there and you're just expecting to get shocked and go oh

Kavanaugh saying it now seems to be guilty until proven innocent and FBI pro but the allegations against Kavanaugh continues boxes John decker is live at the White House\nUm you know but I I think I think there's a couple of things everyone I don't like losing that's just that's point point blank and period of that and I don't like to lose so I you know if you're not trying to win the white play\nThat that's the number one thing with me the number two you know I'm trying to leave a legacy behind like it did other today\nYou know where this is all for ego this is all for you know just to get by but what what the left behind is the impact that you had while you're on this or you know I'm you know along with our mantra company has always along with the investors I've been able to help into and it team members of the work with ... with our company\nYou know I've been able to create a ... I'm a turtle arm of our company called rock star cares\nAnd it that's all we do without it just leaving a mark having that legacy that we can look back on and I'm ... and be remembered for so when you know I think our highlight is that when we sponsor a breast cancer a walk in the city of ... um their first walk\nAll that kind for the city and we've done it back to back years raising twenty thousand dollars for for the Susan Komen Foundation\nOr maybe those are things that just the beginning you know donating supplies going on a mission trip to Guatemala was another thing we did last year I mean these are just some of the things that we want to be able to do\nBecause as you said we've already hit our financial freedom we really hit that it's about now leaving a lasting mark so um it's very very important for fraud that to occur fourth\nNo we say we Robert that interesting because I I don't know who the we in your group is can you share that with everybody who the we is\nYeah I mean I my company's my team you know it's my work family I mean these are people that started a business with me these are people that um\nI identify with the business\nYou know that that are are there when I'm not fair that believed for me when I'm not believing I mean it just it it's it's it's the company in the street that every business just like in your business if the people you know the continuity is that\nThe that commitment to excellence when you're when you're not watching ... having the tell them to to commit for excellent I mean it it that's what we have it so we feel very blessed and what we've done at the company as a group um you know we want to be able to leave that lasting legacy\nFor for you know that that that brand name that would that we're trying to build\nYou know I Know that your employees mean a great deal to you you've ... you've expressed it and show it not just brutally but physically and so many different ways\n[noise] how did you develop that where did that come from for you to believe that that was the basis of your business the employees as opposed to the success of the business what what was it that drove you to that\nYou know um I I've thought about that question a lot because I've I've asked myself you know where to start and I think it started with my father I think it started you know he worked to water for forty five years\nHe was a company man that he was a builder teens he got the very best side of the people you know I and I never I don't remember him sharing lessons with on a one to one basis\nI'm too often it was just more just like listening to the conversation while he was on the phone or going into mystery shops with him and and\nYou know ... in the backseat Gore from Waterford of water burger you know in the at two in the morning three in the morning as he's doing this thing a graveyard shift mystery shop you know and just watching him talk that to everybody and I think that just in my DNA\nYou know I've always felt that my natural coach a natural developer of talent and being able to get the bad side of the people\nAnd and I I realize that that started first before I understood what I was doing you know being able to help somebody out and find out what it is that they wanted what it is that they value most and tried to help them get it I had no idea that that would translate into a building a business\nI just thought it was being a decent human being\nYou know just trying to add value in the world trade try and that she was trying to give back without any kind of expectation on getting anything I return I think it just all started there you know when I credit my father for having that that generosity and him um that that I think he passed down to me um because again maybe look I don't want I'm going to get to the top of them out I Know that\nBut I don't want to get there alone\nI Want to make sure that I have people around me people that we can sloppy each other on the back and give out hugs they might share the\nMemories and the dreams that how we got here you know and I think that's what we're doing here and I think that's what separates our company for many others\nIs that it's a special place to be where everybody's putting in the same direction you know when we lose we always when we when we all went you know and nobody likes to lose so we're in the room and do our best to not let the other person down it's a treaty as a family atmosphere\n[noise] what did you learn from your mother Robert you talk about your father all the time what did you learn from your mother\nMy mother I've ever ego my mother my my mother is extremely strong which is your typical Hispanic mom you know very strong she's the leader of the family she always reminding me to play the play to win\nYou know she always reminding me to go out there and and and play for yourself and play for others around you but don't ever not try\nYou know and and I think I think that's where I developed for her my dad had a lot of this you know incredible intelligence and and as you know generosity of me but my mom had had the had the attitude you know the added the expectation of excellence and the end to end the winning and I I think I think that that that's what I got from my mama\nSo that sounds like the matriarch type family would would that be true\nYeah yes absolutely I said you didn't want to I didn't want to disappoint ... uh uh either one of my parents you know I fear and my father I respect that my father I Love in feared and respecting my mama you know I just I don't I didn't want to let them down either one of them\nWell that's an interesting question because you know you you want to look at you and say you are obviously patriarchal society family\nYou're you had a matriarch mother and um that's got to be difficult when it comes to things like relationships and so forth so it's interesting how you've tried to take that we're going to take a short break

one of the most successful rules to investors lifestyles\nI'm Robert his accomplishment tremendous amount in a very short period of time\nAnd yet he's continuing to grow his process Robert as we look back and you think about things I don't think winters like yourself ever really fail they don't ever really lose\nUm I I really hate self help people to tell you you have to pay enough time to be open field and the times you know if you're not where you want to be have field of the times I don't really believe that that's not my belief system at all although every cell focus says that stuff\nI don't think you've ever failed but what I Do think is that as we get into this process\nThings become self evident the cut uncover it's like wow now I understand and you look back and you go if only I had not made that decision I'd done it this way do you have these deals things when you look back and go\nMan I Wish that would have turned out differently or I Wish I would've done it differently do you have any of those types of that now that twenty twenty hindsight vision that you would have changed\nYou know I I don't I\nI agree with you I don't need people fail I think ... that definition and everybody has a different definition of it I think everything is a learning experience for sure um I I Can't think of some magical you know example I Do think it's very difficult uh when you hire people um and maybe you had more insight\nYou could have made a different decision certainly you know you know we as we get older we get more ... more wise and you get more experience right but that big that comes from making mistakes\nOr or that comes from you know I'm I'm going through a situation and and maybe not everything going out the way the way you expect it so you know I I don't think I have is a particular example where oh I failed and I wish I had done this or you know something I Wish I could undo I Wish I had um\nHad a little more confidence but he's not in myself early on and I wish I'd gone a little bit faster I think if I you know and you were there telling everybody to you know to buy and you can't get rich court slowly you know I never understood that until I got to have a appointed experience for like dang it\nYou know I he's right I mean I if I could have bought or deal is\nA earlier in the cycle you know then they'd be worth so much more today and what have you but at the same time I don't I don't I don't dwell on that because I think you know you're if you're an operator and you know what you're doing you're going to create value you know and so whether you're buying stuff that twenty thirty thousand a door you're buying it when stuff is\nFifty sixty Seventy thousand a door as long as you're pushing ... as long as you're doing a good job and you're keeping your property is all you're going to push rents rents means that right oh I was going to go up\nYou know and you're going to keep ... his dad 'cause everybody's renew lead right so you can create the value but you know certainly I Wish you know I was buying a little bit faster\nYou know I as we were kind of learning our process that you know we're very methodical and I didn't want to go and go quickly whereby about one deal year you know and that was that was fine I think the deals are a little too small\nYou know in hindsight I Wish we had pushed up a little bit higher than we've got a little bit more economies of scale a little bit better unit ... no more unique how means or income more ... more and more opportunity for overhead and and getting getting a a you know maybe better people more quality people I'm more experienced people\nBut other than you know so there's no real example I think everything is just you know experience\nI Want you to share it with his little
