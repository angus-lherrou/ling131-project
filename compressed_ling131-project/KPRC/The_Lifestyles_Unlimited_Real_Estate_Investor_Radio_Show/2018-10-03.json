{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "The wheels and beyond the financial plant that's where you need to get into so how do you talk to your children about how to handle money that they're going to inherit it's a great conversation as a matter of fact when do you do that and then how do you ensure that was going to last beyond you so these are things that I think managing the conversations the expectations\nAnd the priorities surrounding that transfer of wealth is just as important so if you're\nJust getting the booklet done in many times people get the estate planning booked on and they're the only ones that understand that their spouse\nDoesn't know much about it their children and you know what they're lucky if they're executor knows much about it all because usually people just picking executor\nI'm as a matter of fact I've had conversations about executive had spouses getting disputes\nOn one conversation was well you know the spouse ... shows are ah her sister okay\nBut she can't manage a paycheck well that's not a way to pick an executive matter of fact you want to pick somebody that has a little bit of knowledge about managing money and who's going to sit down and helped manage that situation they're the ones that are going to be managing what your what your wishes are and what you want to do so they might want to know a little bit about\nUh managing money or at least have some resources are doing that so\nJust because it's they trusted individual does not make them a good executive so those are things um we come across but if a financial planners focus is very much on preparing\nThe assets for the family but it's also very important to prepare the family for the assets and I think that's where we don't see a lot of people do that they don't take the time in the initiative\nAnd that's why when you hear that the third generations investments in those trust don't last well that's the big reason why they have not had a communication it's a matter of fact a study to show that following the state transfer Seventy percent of the time the wealth did not successful transfer to the wealth creators grandchildren\nNow that's a big I mean that's that's the third generation and some more than half the time the breakdown in is interesting communication a quarter time it is due to lack of preparedness for the younger generations part\nSo you've heard the stories about trust fund kids right I mean we've heard we've seen them you've got T. V. shows on them and they're out there and they're having a great time believe me it's ah sometimes it's a little envious but they're having a great time but you know I was told myself how long is that gonna last that's gonna fizzle out\nAnd then you hear stories that you know what such and such a no longer has the money they no longer have those friends and that entourage that was with them and they're out there trying to figure out what they're going to do in finding a job that they've never been prepared for it so you know this is why talking to your heirs about wealth\nWill help mitigate these pitfalls and set them up to preserve and grow their inheritance\nFor future generations so if they're young well here's the thing make sure the executives has your goals in mind so you know if it's in my kids you know teenagers I mean right now teaching them about the value of working the value of the pay check the value of a dollar that's important as many as a parent is important for me to do\nThe sitting around talking about a trust and how that's going to work is probably not the timing\nHowever my executor I Need to make sure he knows in my goals and what I Want for the future and in for my kids to have before they get their basically their hands or the ability to get that money so those are things you you should communicate and your advisors should be helping you have these conversations a lot of times\nWhat you can do you can bring on a son or daughter and bring him on a certain age would every film when they're responsible and that's going to be every parent or I can tell you what what age are kids going to be responsible to vary some that may never happen\nBut bottom line bring him in his co trustee start teaching them about how to preserve in value and how to invest that money and that's going to be very important again looking for later generations so you know parents are often concerned about wealth or you know desensitized adults from Durham pursuits but you know again this is where you have fights amongst the money\nYou know I've seen a many times where you had the executor who's managing\nWho thinks they're going to get a lot it's not clear so these are all other things that are you ... spelled out and having these family meeting so if you've got more than one sibling\nHaving family meetings communicating how this is going to work in the wishes are that's going to be in Fort important so you know having those are holding and family means meetings with your state plan or with your advisor who's going to be managing the money\nAnd not putting that booklet away and and this is some of the things that we do we ... a lot of times we go sit\nIn the estate planning meetings with our clients we learn about the state there which is\nHow they want that money transferred to the children we ... we learned about the nuances of each child\nOr what charities that they that they held charitable inclined and then we help them facilitate that and so if something were to happen to the monarch or to both ... both individuals you know we're kind of the next place to go we can communicate what the wishes are so these are important things and and I just encourage you because I've seen so many ... have seen as well\nAnd it's surprising when I tell people you know how many people do not have wills and people just kind of laugh and say there's no way that's possible it is possible we see it all the time and\nAgain executing the will even if you get one done there are things that have to be done and I'll tell you a a may have said this before but just to a story that I had read about you know the estate planning a you know articles that we read maybe other people do find interesting\nBut you know that an individual had a the state passed on he wanted to pass on his daughter she was and it will but he didn't change the beneficiary from his ex wife\nSo when the individual passed away\nHis ex wife got the wealth his daughter didn't get anything and of course ... what do you think happened well there's lots of courts lots of lawyers getting wealthy lots of fighting going on but at the end guess who ended up\nWith the state the ex wife so you see this all the time I was never see a case where there's not some big improvement that needs to be made a it's kind of unfortunate I mean a lot of great attorneys out there that practices board certified as a buying attorneys if it was a well I had my documents drawn up by a board certified\nState planning attorney well great that's a great start but are all things in order in other words for the things that flow through the will need to be flowing through the will if you have a trial yeah trust is it funded I don't know\nYeah okay well you need to know what do you mean if it is that's always um so we're doing our job is the what we're doing our job you have any personal balance sheet you know we're all these things are these documents you know how this works you've seen the flow chart if you will of one thing happened the scenarios what takes place\nAnd you know to your point uh you know if you have a spouse pass away they go ... I had a guy the other day of functions and yeah we had the wheels have done a long time ah everything goes to the wife that's the way we you know she would want it was you know how much money in taxes she's going to lose if that takes place the way under the current law set up\nUm even if it goes some some of these laws are sunset is expected to do in the case was state taxes um it's going to be even a bigger tax bill she issue well no I guess what happens if something or unfortunately they happen to you and then\nShe remarried you know I mean these things happen in real life we see all the time and has to be in order and planned on my top headed website as the dot com you've been listening to the SPA money out\nEven listening for entertainment purposes small\nAnd the woman Michelle

multiple questions about the president's tone during a rally last night when he appeared to mock Christine Ford who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assaults in high school\nFinancially free could you not at the same time I ever going to be physically fit could you at the same time have a goal that I'd like to have a great relationship with my my wife I'd like to have a great relationship with my kids could you have many goals the same time I'd like to do something for my church why can't you have all those goals\nBut what he should be talking about if you get his verbiage right these ... wrong is that you should only focus on one thing at a time\nAnd as you're working on that one thing you focus on that one thing that a priority and if you have more than three priorities in life you don't have any priorities at all so you have momentary priorities in your life but let's think about this he's saying don't set unrealistic goals\nEvery goal out there is unrealistic\nEvery goals unrealistic for example I Want to retire\nWell let's talk about that for a second you want to retire so your goal is basically unrealistic\nSay well I Want to retire and by the time I'm thirty by the time I'm fifty sixty Seventy years old now you're saying well that's not so unrealistic right but if you say that to yourself I'm going to retire by the time I'm sixty five years old I guess what will happen\nExactly that you're giving yourself a very realistic goal that you can meet and when you meet that goal it's sixty five years of age and retire you have completely become successful being mediocre\nYou are now a mediocre human being but what's wrong with that is if you've been mediocre through your entire life\nBecause you never stressed your abilities you never kept into your real power\nBecause you set with the goals\nIf you sit wimpy goals you get wimpy results\nSo I Would like to suggest you that this guy is getting it wrong and maybe we can help him out by just give him a little more information that there's really two types of goals in your life\nThere's short term and long term goals there's big goals and then there's monitor or momentary steps in between where you take that goal you break it up into bite sized pieces\nSo if I were to say I want to retire in five years or less that's probably an unrealistic goal according to this guy I'm sure to most people that's unrealistic yet we have people who are lifestyles do it\nOver and over and over and over again\nNow once they decide that that is their goal then we're going to sit down with some short term goals right\nAnd the short short term goals are going to be set up to get something done in a time period\nA short time period in other words guy the other day said his wife told them if you can do this stuff I Want you to buy the first house within thirty days and he bought the first house within thirty days she told if you're going to go out for apartments I Want the first apartment complex within forty five days or Ninety Days whatever what any he went and got it within Ninety Days\nThose short term goals where he focused on one topic at a time\nBut that did not and we're not it or not even today is long term goal is long term goal might be you know I think he said he wanted to be like Robert Martinez wee ones don't tan apartment complex or better there up have an incredible business have incredible employees have incredible life\nAs a big unrealistic goal for a guy that only only nine houses in even four years ago didn't even know nine houses now he wants to own apartment complex wow so here's this guy tried to convince people in a seminar in a video that was set out\nThat you should have wimpy little goals\n[noise] man let's think about this for a second\nDo you set a goal set a goal you got to ask a question and you have to ask the right question for example I Want to lose weight I can tell you how to lose weight if you ask yourself how to lose weight it's very simple stop eating\nRight you'll lose weight does that really what you want I can tell you another way workout twelve hours a day\nEvery day and you lose some weight but does that really what you want so you're not asking the right question you could lose a hundred pounds or you can lose twenty pounds and gained it all back the next week so losing weight is that really the\nElections that really the goal the goals to lose weight and then to gain it right back again that's not really the goal is but you haven't defined the goal and if you don't find the goal the goal will define itself\nSo how many of you start on a diet and exercise program and say I'm going to lose some weight and you do you lose five or ten maybe Fifteen or twenty pounds\nBut you never get all the way to where you really want to be\nAnd you don't in most cases maintain what you've already accomplished she asked the wrong question\nA better question would be how could I lose\nFifteen pounds how can they lose twenty five pounds of very specific about\nAnd that would be a better question because you know whether you've succeeded or not when you lose Fifteen pounds you've succeeded right but that may not get you where you really want to be\nA better question is what if you lose the Fifteen pounds and gained it back a better question is going to be how do I lose Fifteen pounds and they maintain\nThat loss that's the key asking the right questions is going to create direct results but they've got to be giant giant goals because if you shoot for the mountaintop you're going to hit\nThe ... if you shoot for the stars you're going to take a short break pick this up on the other side will be right back if you don't want the radio show\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the

back to the radio show today was disgusted with you a different concept the concept is one of dead equity and what it's doing to you as a human being or as a family with your investments and I do this and\nLived seminars in a way that really probably doesn't work on the radio but I go through it for you because if you listen to the park as if you drive and you're probably not going to get this but if you listen to the podcast and by the way if you are driving listening to the shows you should realize that there are a pod cast\nOf every show I Do that you can go back to and listen to again if you'd like to so if you miss the climate\nWhat everybody do is add up their total net worth so that'd be the value of you know the value of your home after you take off the mortgage a four one K. your IRA your savings accounts here uh stocks and bonds\nYour cash savings all of your assets\nInclude little beliefs college fund all of your money at it all up what are you what is your net worth most people don't even know that that's the first thing you should do is you know what your network is uh you can't\nHave a goal like we are talking last segment about a goal or something you don't even know what it is and your net worth is really the secret to wealth um ... you got to be able to build that network and secondly you not only do you want to build and protect that network you have to have a return on it\nAnd if you don't have a return on it then it's useless even having a 'cause all you're going to do is you get to spend it one way or another whether you spend it now you spend later to spending it so the network has to have a return to what I Want you to do is add up your network than what I Want you to do is take an add up all your passive income\nFor a year ago two thousand Seventy and passed me income is going to be you know interest income\nRoyalty income net rental income that's the net um out after all the costs expenses that goes with it a net rental income\nOr it's those things that come to you from investments know by the way\nA a retirement account is not passive income that's Vern deferred earned income in other words you've already earned it and now you're getting paid it right this deferred compensation so that is not earned income\nUh or is not passive income uh four one K. money ... money out of four one K. that is not passive income because of four oh one K. is earned income you put it in there you're Puerto matched it because you had a job\nSo which got to ask yourself is what\nIncome producing assets do I owe and how much income that I own even if I didn't go to work how much income would I earn in two thousand Seventeen\nNow the next step is to take the income and divided by the network and what you have is a return on your net worth\nWhat most people find when we do this live is it Ninety Ninety Ninety five percent of the people have less than one percent return on their network now how do you expect your family to get anywhere financially when you're making less than one percent on your network\nThat's a very scary thought to try to figure that out how you think you're gonna get rich on that are going to live off that even if you had an high net worth the only made half a percent or tens of ... percent I mean you're talking about they don't even have a percent return they have a tenth of a percent return\nIs what you're looking at now that's about Ninety percent of people and then some people\nHave some investments see another ... another five percent to six or seven percent said more so you're up to like Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven percent and they're making somewhere between one and five percent return on their network\nAnd that's because they've employed this capital to do something\nRight now the problem is some they might even be making deals and make a hundred percent return on a real estate deal but that hundred percent than is divided outta crossed\nEight hundred thousand dollars with a network than it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they lowered the rate of return of the best ones by having too much equity\nSo the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing what are the worst culprits the worst culprits are your personal residents your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand and your IRA or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't because you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you wait until you're six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you you're thinking wow this things making the money but it isn't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
