{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Not first day plan it so that sounds like Halloween or [laughter]\nYou know even though it's not celebrate I tell you what it is something that you know many of the individuals I think they tend to kinda just skip over it\nOr when they look at it and I think they can do something easy but you know we we sit down a lot with our clients and we take every one from the poor management the financial plan to what are we going to do when you leave behind your assets who do you want to have those assets how do you want those to be distributed\nYou know I think many people think estate planning as well if you're going to be very rich can be very wealthy and while this tax plan in may be different for those that are you know passwords twenty two million now so per couple so you'll have a million each well so if you're not there you may not need a state tax plan but passing on\nAssets things that you have can be very critical so you know they play in the process of planning for the administration and disposition up property after someone dies\nSo the goals or a state plan may include the following um avoiding the confusion when it comes to your final wishes this is something you you go see it with any estate planner that's been around for a while they will tell you so many stories you will beg to get that planned on ensure that you chose\nAnd have a legal guardian of your choice you know if those if you think that you're young you know you do well in a your athletic and your bullet proof right do you think nothing could happen to you well you know what a not having what's going to happen for for your children is definitely something you must have been must do protecting leveling fines sure they receive your assets\nAre helping to avoid avoid conflict and family members believe me we've seen a either conflicts when it's not been spelled out who gets what um you see the gloves come off\n... minimizing taxes and legal expenses isn't that something we all want to do I mean we all know how taxes can be an especially a legal expenses wealth preservation free intending beneficiaries and flexibility before you die so these are all things that a good state plan will do for you\nYou know so if you die without on state uh basically that would include will your considers have died it's a state okay and the state will decide basically uh what they will determine who get your assets and they'll determinant under the state's inheritance laws so if you want the state to determine who gets your assets\nWho gets the guardianship of your children then don't do anything and I can I can assure you that is not the best plan\nYou know a plane is a must\nEven especially let's think about ... outside of you know non traditional marriage is people that have had second marriages people that are no longer married maybe they have a you know merge families I mean these are all things because you don't want children from a previous marriage or your ... you know again you don't want your old spouse getting your assets ended up to go to your children there's so many mistakes we've seen happen\nSo kind of breaking down the state plan because I think again talking about what's going to happen to you\nWhen you pass is not the best conversations sit down with your spouse and say hey let's just talk about her deaths you know I mean what we can do we want to pick for that that darkly me one that we had last weekend but it's not a fun conversation but you need to have it and it doesn't have to be all that terrible so I think some terms\nThat are probably pretty critical you know the state which includes all the property that's owned by the defeated are deceased person a and basically that you want distributed by will or trust on her heritage is also that's going to be everything that you want to be passed on so now we can break that down the property\nProperty is divided into two categories you got real property which is land your permanent residents structure minerals mineral rights and in personal property which is basically everything other than real property so that could be your house jewelry something that's been in the family the paintings whatever that may be\nSo those are things that you're going to want to divide and the will and and make make determinations on where they go\nAnd then there's the grants or guns or rival goes are valuable yes salute you you might want to make sure you if you you know who's going to get your guns I'm so there's the grant or this is going to be terminology the grain towards the person transferring the property to another party says refer to grant ... under the trust that he or she created\nThe beneficiaries the person who inherits property from the grand tour so the beneficial it could be one or multiple parties are so you could have you know usually if you have a spouse usually the spouse is gonna be the beneficiary and then you're going to have contingent beneficiaries and if you have children and you try to protect them for a lifetime of assets for lifetime\nYou're generally going to pass this into a trust and then there's determinations on how that trust is manage a and at what age do the children have access to that trust and I'll tell you\nYou know you may think your your child is the best with money and great I Would make that a long time as a matter of fact I had in his co trustee for a period of time to prove themselves before you have access to that money you know what it's not always just your children or just your child\nIs who is that child married to what is the intent there so there's things that you can do you can have spousal privilege provisions that allow or your you know your your child that include espouse later on or you can actually keep that in your family and that passes to the grandkids lots of things you can do their so trustee is the person or entity who administers property\nOn behalf and for the benefit of beneficiaries in quarters now with the trust document okay successor trustee as a person entered it takes over the duties assigned to the original trustee so you know these are all things that you need to put into place say who is going to be responsible for what you do you think oh I've got um\nYou know I've got somebody in executor okay somebody's going to administer your wishes well if that person do anything about managing money transfer and property dealing with families you know you want to find ten is our tendency is to find someone very close and the family\nBut not all the times that exist you may have to hire a third party so you know all these things are things you want to really consider\nBut at the end of the day I'll just give you a quick synopsis sat down this weekend or this this past week with a client\nWe did the financial plan handed to the financial plan to the estate planner say plane of said you know what the first big part of our meeting has over ... constructed that a financial plan for you now the next thing is to talk about your wishes\nWithin one hour that's all it took\nUs all took gave them some of the talking points who's going to do what what people in your in your life are going to do the following and basically documents drafted\nA couple of weeks later guess what they have that put in place and we see it all the time people don't have wills they put it off do not make that mistake it was a mistake cost you your family your loved ones and it's one of the biggest mistakes we've seen occur often and by the way please don't do a go go thank you can do it yourself\nWe actually saw documents someone spin a hundred and sixty bucks in for not too much more than that we got it done right they had many mistakes it would cost them thousands\nOf all the time they say that happens already got it fixed and they've got it done and it turns out that they do not have done a but a good review is generally the all this news generally you know many times will happen to do that for people a show you what is a is Dr was released remind you sometimes will they'll do how it works at any given scenario and so it's important to have a review\nMaxed us on four o'clock of those drugs yeah yeah I was I was gonna ask you this is dogs playing poker is that considered art that they could be you know in the eyes of the whole like all our objective go Astros at the website SCA well dot com [noise]\nEven listening to it for entertainment purposes can you can\nMarkets and the money

generation where you know you just didn't have that you pay cash for everything and so that's how I was right and so I really had to change my paradigm banking I've just had to realize that\nYou know that can be good that can help you build asked would they it can help generate income for you if it's used correctly and it it's not a bad thing it's a good thing to leverage other people's money to create well so that was the big question for me I just had to get over\nThe way that I was raised and brought up on our views on that\nAs I've heard your your stories through the years I was thinking that to me your your story is a bit of an example of how to distinguish those timeless life lessons to help us exceed that we get from our families\nFrom the ideas we need to transform in order to make our dreams and desires of reality and will unfold that here with your story today we don't want to forget about you and your parents were commercial real estate investor so what was that like as you were growing up\n... and um it all started out originally when my father and my uncle or and the ... commercial construction business and um they ended up shutting down or business after um gosh uh you know like\nForty years does nothing I had a cousin that um started a national brokerage company and\nWhat happened is a he would come across these particular deals my father in law or is looking for\nA no investments they buy you know cows and and that didn't work out too good at best and some other stock and that wouldn't work out too good but\nIt was my uh cousin ended up he was paid and then some of these properties to him and I was watching that I saw where they were making money and both my father Marcos to cash in on this maybe would have gotten in ... stayed ownership business before you know there's some benefits to it\nCertainly was I went to college I got to college and you know I said what do you think you'd want to I said well I Know what\nI said I like to be on the commercial real estate business you know thought what better way to get started and maybe you know try to try to make some transactions and\nSo I got my real estate license and uh for sale hooked up with a group here in Dallas and for a number of years it worked out pretty good or for like five years I made quite a few are made some retail leases\nAnd that worked out real good and then the mean time I was always trying to make them transaction apartment complex for shopping center seemed like I was always\nA lead towards that direction and after about five years there was talk before I had money and sometimes for I didn't have money and I'm On what the scarlet brought them back a lot of being in the commercial real estate broker and I said I had a\nReally large apartment complex for sale and I had a ...\nUh what was going to um by this person and I worked on this thing probably for nine months and um and the guy got up and it was just the last ... months before is over and the guy walked out and I thought you know what I Can't do this any more I thought I'm going to get out of this and so\nI ended up going and I ended up finding I've gone around I really didn't want to get into management too much and I did like sales and so what I did I thought you know maybe it would be wise to go over there and get into something that's more of a consumable product and be steady income\nAnd why sales or might have planned that worked at a a distribution company in\nA anyways I ended up um you know found the ins and outs that business and\nGot in with a with a big distributor and\nDid that for a number of years and and that was good and I liked it and it was enjoyable especially in the beginning but as time went on I realized that I'm not going to end up my my income level are limited not really didn't want to go into management um if I could help it 'cause I I just didn't like necessarily managing people in particular\nUm so what I did is um because I was going along I remember one day I thought you know wash still need to go back and\nAnd I I never let\nWe'll stay out of the back of my mind but um you know the real estate with my father my mother and my uncles the lesson so Tom on on I ended up um I remember once I was down at a franchise show I'm just looking around and my father was a\nIt was called the pad printing a machine and I've seen some of these women and some of our houses I Walk there and I saw the injection motors were imprinted on odd shaped items like your keyboard on your computer\nUm it could be football something that's not screen printing is where you're printing on something that's flat and I thought you know this isn't this is a pretty um a unique type of a business and I knew that there was demand for it and so I did that and\nUm I was doing that as a hobby actually as I sold one on the Internet and I came across a few jobs are really put me on the ... I had one company that want me to put a imprint on a\nOn a cooler a hundred thousand coolers and they paid me quite a bit of money for it and so\nI was I ended up getting into a warehouse and and I'm actually had to hire ... which are one\nTwo in favor of ... you got had am saying is I did that for a number of years and that turned into a choir lucrative business and getting in the defense industry I'm a printed on certain things\nAre wow that's the uh uh and\nSo that was and that led me and I ended up you know I did that for quite a few years\nFor quite a quite a journey Leo I mean you

going you know I I don't want to expand that's I don't want to have employees I don't want to do this somebody offered you a great price and and you said okay and you sold your business and and you found yourself now\nI'm looking out at in uncharted\nUncharted voyage why don't you do next\n\nWell when we started selling stock options so we buy the stock and we sell the options\nAnd ... had been listening for years on the radio to this from\nThat was advertising their program and so we got in there and and we did quite well it the first because really you buy the stock he's still the option immediately on your computer you're given credit and to your account\nAnd that was great and that we were asked to buy stock the stock every month for tend not to kill we were called out of the stock well and that was fine and good we were cost averaging you know on our\nStock and um\nIt was good until the recession hit because then the stock prices on some of our holding started going down and they went down so loud that we got to wear on some of them we couldn't sell the options anymore so actually our equity was going down\nAnd we were losing our principal and then our income on our stock option income was going down so we knew that we we had to make a change you know we were just looking for something more where um our equity would increase in value and that we'd have a steady income so we decided that we needed to make a change\nIn how is that from your perspective\n[noise] well I just thought you know we've got we've gotten ourselves a poor old guy accumulation from past year\nAnd I thought you know what I kept I did it a couple of ... or I Would try to get hold of real estate brokers tried to buy something that's called triple ... at least and and maybe on a small office warehouse Everytime I Do that on ended up getting um somebody was bought out and walk and you get to it\nAnd I was really first read it and that shows\nAnd um so and I kept her in the program on the uh radio about this you know stock option than it was good like Peggy mentioned\nAnd for a while and then uh it got or I just realized that you know we're supposed to hold our some of the stocks have now tariffs on them uh with China and I thought jeeze you know is that there are some flaws on this program and um\nI told her I said you know what I keep hearing about lifestyle them limited on the\nRadio and I said you know we've got to go check this program around you see what it's all about it's been on for a number of years\nAnd so that's what I'm I thought you know that's where it kind of lead let us over to uh the lifestyles are yet to stay in a pet you know I go on to it a couple of times and um it was and then you know that it was a whole nother process will tell you get hurt you know to\nJoin and uh 'cause we both need to do it together 'cause we're team and um she's smarter than I Am and um\nShe makes better ... about a ... percent of the time\nAnd um anyway so uh you could you know that\nIt was I knew that lifestyles where we need to be a good today and because they talk about everything and really in a way I guess my background on the path wasn't wasted um because what happened is it all came back to me with\nThe knowledge from the family from now from um\nUh just you know going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know but there
