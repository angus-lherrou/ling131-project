{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "[noise] USDA money our radio that\n[noise] Missouri Day course off about four percent over the past week interesting though the U.S if I've had it on the brink of\nSeeing this nearly fifty year record\nAs the stock market has been selling off really over the last few weeks has been a pretty punishing October for the stock markets are here in the United states everywhere else in the world as we talked about is largely been down all ready for the year including bonds\n... degree to which stock market cinnamon has turned sour may be ... best illustrated by pretty unwelcome record\nAnd if the as simply five hundred index is lower in either of the to a final sessions of October it will mark it seventeenth day down representing that the highest number of down days in a month and a month since April of Nineteen Seventy\nThat's according the Dow Jones market data\nAbroad market index current number of declining sessions already ranks as the most since two thousand and eight so we've obviously seen some pretty good so often multiple days of it but uh we have this distinction probably dubious extend distinction by the U.S and the five hundred or for the U.S will be my mother comes as the index\nAh forwarding with being down about ten percent for the trees and top second time this year and I was Eighteen and as a composite also already encouraging territory for the first time since two thousand sixteen\nAnd the downdraft has been party sparked by a litany of worries ranging from you know things that we discuss writes logo and grow global growth interest rate hikes reserve\nA U.S economy that has a ... year of expansion bull market that is similarly also is old but also has a lot of uh Brett issues really only ... view of the stocks made up these games for this year\nAnd many fear a I think that maybe the recession on the rise and we're not predicting\nBut many do and the frequency of down days for the U.S will be five hundred comes after balance of uncanny a you know just sort of sessions and issues this year as represented to a cascade worry [noise] written selling despite US Economy that so far do pretty well\nPretty strong brigade earnings um the Dow Jones industrial average is down about eight percent in October which marks its largest monthly decline since May of two thousand ten\nThis will be five hundred is down about ... percent this month which would be the worst monthly losses February of two thousand nine\n... off about twelve and a half percent would be the largest one month drop since October of two thousand eight\nAnd a small capitalization Russell two thousand index down\nTo a point nine percent which would be its worst month since two thousand and eight so a pretty interesting to see how difficult October has been and have basically two corrections within the same calendar year within eight months of each other\nWell thing for investors I mean the one thing you want to try to get away from his focus on on basically October you know when you're looking at your statements when you're sitting down and kind of going through everything focus on your year to date losses I mean you know obviously a huge mother in terms of the downturn but if they started two thousand two hundred thousand who's invested in the U.S and the five hundred\nUm you know you look at everything in terms of perspective is year to date or you know ... tally the losses from your total ... so if you had bonds that were earning ... ... you had cash\nAnd and then again other things other aspect classes maybe ... look at the total loss in perspective I think sometimes people get pretty caught up in just one area\nAnd if you look at the equity markets it's easy to kind of pinpoint and go to that\nBut you got to put the current martyrs level in perspective and again I'm just remember you know we are you going to rebound\nYou know this is the one thing I always uh baffles me is people don't want to rebalance on the periodic basis we rebalance here I think you know that should be part of your portfolio or anywhere you're doing and if you liked the sector it's part of your bigger in long term plan you know argue rebalancing into some of this area so it goes to the question do you think this is a sell off\nOr you may think this is a sort of another bear market so that's going to be dependent on whether or not you you actually rebalance here but you keep in mind keep that discipline\nA you know many people have that tendency just to change and roll into safety and then of course we notice they never get back in we've seen that time and time again they never read the poor people have an exit strategy and that's just to get out the redeployment strategy is one of the toughest ones out there and by the way no one's going to be cheering you want when it's the proper time to to redeploy\nMe if you look at how for the fortunes have been made in the past when will true wealth has been made in the past when we've had panics and crisis as few people came in early so you know then what's good cheer you on the way back in but make it part of a discipline and you don't have to try to turn to mark and I think many people get caught up\nAnd trying to trying to market all the time so you just keep that in mind when you're looking or in view losses by time frame was another thing to kind of help you with this or how much money are you down from the ... it's a good idea to think about your investments and kind of two baskets\nWhat you need now versus what you're getting the longer term so you know where is if you're if you're at retirement right now you know obviously where you're getting your income is very important so had that in in a in a perspective\nAnd then where's your growth assets what is your time frame on that is that five to ten years so don't worry about it in a single month of October and that's the thing that you put that in perspective a little help get through this a lot easier\nThoughts that's great [laughter]\n\nI have no for the thoughts thoughts well actually she got a apple announced some um upgrades to products that have not been updated since uh twenty ten in the case of the ... air have not changed the design of the ... year since two thousand to get product it's a great part of it and we're not great yeah\nI think I bought mine two thousand maybe eleven ten maybe eleven\nRolling out with a new one last week Greek testament to the quality of a product just been updated in eight years\nIt is a but at the same time they don't get is like the phones now people are placing them less often about every three years before they would do that every two years\nWhich you know a sort of a blessing that occurs right for them people are going out there buying the newest greatest because the evolution is not really come out all that far if you look at well I Want to go buy it at a thousand dollar phone because the pixels or a little better and better camera better care yeah\nKnow now my kids want one every time it comes out and I said no wait every every two to point out years as the average cycle right now you can do to sign\nYour brink of course T Mobile actually has it where if you get on a plan they'll actually upgrade you every year or any of your financing it through yeah yeah I mean for the Mac sitting\nAlone I'll just say apple didn't really get a heck of a boost from all this uh this announcing today they're going to I mean maybe a\nPoint one percent [noise] um [noise] what's the new stuff

safe low cost and\nAnd you'd be set for life that we followed both at the very strongly saving as much as they get every month so that's where we were when Gregor realize that we were getting wherever we wanted to go and that he could retire at a fairly young age\nSo Gregor what was it that boom\nThere gums this idea out of nowhere this isn't working the way I thought it was when and where did that happen put me as a fly on the wall listening to what you were thinking and what you had to say about that about that\nOh we'd been saving quite a bit more you know\nMore than the average average American and a searing all the financial planner saying you could you know live on three to four percent of it without outliving it\nAnd you know I've made\nMore is a veterinarian first second you're out of um within five years out of that school I was making more money than that and our our cost of living was higher and I didn't want to retire and have to you know skip and save and\nYou know not just ah you live live a good lifestyle and now that\nHave retired um I Would say our lifestyles actually improved are\nAre you making more money in real estate now than I was able to and in veterinary medicine and not having to worry about an alarm clock\nWhile that's great about them going to go back to you now tell us again I loved the fly in the wall concept was Gregory saying to you when he first heard about lifestyles because he wasn't that impressed a quarter of your resume here he just wasn't here in it\nWere was it yet how\nDid he finally change because I don't want him to tell the story because I Want to hear from the outside to see what you saw going on truly in his mind\nUm I was truly the skeptic about it more than he was on he actually heard about it for the boy scout friend\nOne of them is super involved in lifestyle and why is that pop it comes when he has money doing that otherwise it's not very active and both of them just talk to him and eventually probably ten minutes you know how you need to look into that you know the what's going on you love it\nThat Gregory was like great didn't follow it and\nThen he went to buy our TV died and he found with research it because of the perfect TV he wanted and it was like an hour away that gets in the car turned on the radio at her day morning\nAnd there is a radio show about life and he listens and then all of a sudden every time he and the car he's trying to find lifestyles on radio\nBut he is not really pushing so he's not really trying to convince me to do anything just gathering information which

Bethany you take\nFrom Dallas area who have are currently thirty eight apartment community are invested in they have actually purchased forty six so they are the three thousand southerners twenty nine units\nAnd they started out as skeptics out this was a great story because these are family coming from highly compensated self employed business individuals\nHigh skill sets accounting background business background and they work their way into this thing and took off but not after some consternation trying to figure out if it was real or not so as we get back with them here as we went to a break I asked them they went to the first road trip\nA together and multiple road trips that said they've been to every road trip to to have been there except for days when they had some other come up with like travel or the question I have shared with this as best you can\nHow on um how the\nThe way our members share how you feel about the way our members share their personal information their business information to business practices et cetera et cetera to the open public within our private group can you share that with us and tell us how you really feel about that\n\nWell personally I mean I honestly think that one at the very best and cannot live on I've actually been on a\nTrip with lead where they're looking at a property trying to decide if they're going to I Am too they're cognitively accent very specific question\nSo that Fifth Fleet looking at a different property tend to have a number in their hand or and I yeah in your hand or bender in their hand and most of the time I get a response within three to five that\nHere's the number you need ... for what it cost me to have our parking lot because I Know the parking lots are about the same time\nUm I don't know where else you can get that kind of help from someone who is probably not even going to invest in this property they're just trying to help\nGregory what do you think of all that what do you think about the the openness financially and you know she's talked a business practice was well she just really talked about information how 'bout business practices and financial information that shared\nIt it it it's pretty much an open book or within the lifestyles family are you\nPretty much go up to anybody\nAnd ask them their experience um I've had that thing I've had sit down with other um you know people highly compensated for saying what\nWe've done how we did it why we did it um and you know\nThere's really I can talk\nTalk more and ask more questions of the lifestyle members you know then I can with my next door neighbor and you know even more so well almost more probably more so than even I did with my parents when they were alive knowing their background you know\nWhere they had their money invested in such and no no no question is really taboo you know within the lifestyles are and ... it's great you know the veterinary business uh\nWe don't you know we don't share information as far as you know what are you paying on rent and you know how much you paying for this\nTest or this piece of equipment\nAnd all that is fair game and and within lifestyles and ... actually encourage a you know people helped me out when I first started and now I'm you know passing it back and help and you know all the people that think there\nAre you know very similar to Tibet study and I and I'm ... now where you know glad to help you know all those lifestyle members that we can\nAs members from looking inside out and remembering back when you were looking outside in what do you think creates the abundance mentality that the members of lifestyles have that there's enough for all of us where do you think that comes from\n\nI think part of the number of exactly what you fat and they're always deals going on there I always opportunity to ask if they fit in your lifestyle goal so there's no need for me to not tell you something because it may end up helping me again
