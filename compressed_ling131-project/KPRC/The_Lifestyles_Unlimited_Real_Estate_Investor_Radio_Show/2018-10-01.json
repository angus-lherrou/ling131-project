{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Do you imagine though I mean that's that's pretty good size ... like Canada's pretty good Mexico good you want to be neighborly and obviously get a good trade agreements with your neighbors but what about all eyes and then now turn to the European Union and we get into a solid agreement out with our European partners\nEven bigger economy collectively what if we get a deal with China\nUm would ... I mean the dial up to her boss points on that news imagine what that might look like the world's second largest economy so I think it would have pretty big implications and a positive sense of we somehow got to a deal but this was this is a a you know sort of the landscape here or something that took\nDecades to get to a rightly argue that it's been unfair I don't think there are too many on either side that have argued that it is particularly fair in a in a way but um you know you have the president taking a very firm stance I think that it has scared many people\nOh no what are we going to do if you know we upset the Chinese you know it's going to start World War three people think this way it's irrational but they think this way\nUm and so they get upset about this I Want to understand how so we're talking about the data how does it affect the Chinese economy what is the data tell us about the Chinese economy currently\nCourse there is can be a cause and effect but there may be some coincidental factors as well but all said and done that China's economy is not performing all that well\nEven in the manufacturing space and of course we see by comparison the United states and our economy of course in the second quarter we saw good four point to a new allies GDP Growth were looking for good growth and the third quarter we've seen good your over your earnings by corporations\nAre a lot of that we met some of that in fact was bitten by a trade policy in which is a one time effect but we've had good ... good year over year earnings but if you want to get away from the effects of earnings and tax policy you look at top line growth you've had top line growth eight to ten percent growth\nThat's pretty good that's really good in fact so it's not all that bad and it's not all earnings manipulation while you certainly want to recognize some of this and tax policy and the one time benefits you can certainly see the idea that um that the top line as something that's a little more difficult to a game if you will\nBut we see the widening of us shares and their premium versus the international markets us the U.S will be five hundred served seven point two percent and the third corps the biggest gain and five years\nThe rally as I mentioned earlier does come out of the cost us stocks have become increasingly expensive compared to major in ... indices elsewhere\nSome some animals so I think are worrying could leave the market vulnerable to snap back are heading into the final months of the year on a price to earnings basis the U.S stocks are trading at a ... percent premium to an M sci index of twenty to develop markets and twenty four emerging markets\nAlso as I said before the break this is the biggest gap since two thousand nine for the year the U.S and the as up nine percent the stocks zero six hundred indexes down one point five percent the Shanghai composite has fallen Fifteen Percent\nThat's where the year and the Japanese Nikkei stock market averages\nSix percent up six percent or by the way the Shanghai is downs Fifteen Percent or so for the year that's not the doubt that's out now how far it has been for the high from the high it's impacting bear market territory north of twenty per cent decline\nIt's hard to imagine that the divergence evaluation is very substantial sustainable though so you see the good things are happening the emerging world in some places but the global investors are attracted to the United states many investors are less worried about us stock reversal such as\nUm you know what happened at certain times of say a correction\nAnd you look at some of the surveys show\nSome of the eurozone economy stalling an emerging markets from Indonesia turkey Brazil tumbling as you see the U.S dollar strengthen us stocks investors\nThey seem to be doing much better and you know since all this we see the doors weekend as a busters have taken the U.S is in China's latest trade skirmishes in stride leading some market watchers to ask whether the yawning gap between the stocks in the United states and the\nRest of the world is on borrowed time and in fact nearly fifty percent of investors believed the divergence of global economy will end with the U.S the seller rating\nTwenty eight percent just ... percent investors believed the divergence will in because of growth in Asia and Europe accelerating so if you look at us valuations an absolute performance they are\nStretched fully valued but not\nNecessarily bubble territory so some people were very sympathetic to this idea that there's going to be a convergence between the U.S and the rest of the world and that the u._s. has got to be the one to pull back as opposed to the rest of the world catching up that help [noise]\n[noise] yeah I um [noise] so there's a divergence yeah and but you also say on the show that there's going to be a correction it was going to be ...\nWell no well I always would I say is there will be one it just a matter of when and how they're my question is what if there isn't but I Want to be clear eyed ... saying that I had been projecting that bear market or a no no no no I'm just saying it's going to happen it's gonna happen no matter what but my question is what if it doesn't what what what if\nIt just keeps accelerating and mobile political situation stabilizes maybe even Venezuela you know gets a new government in place and things start to change and it just keeps keeps going all the great will still be invested\nAnd according to this one you should still have your money in risk assets\nAre and if you see no risk of recession on the horizon and the economic a landscape looks\nPositive and strong UCs fundamentals relatively sound with things like earnings continue to increase evaluations seeming to be while maybe even currently stretched out and sort of bubble territory and you don't see any technical breakdowns are priced momentum\nGreat that's the beauty of having a discipline if you're not\nYou're sort of been one camp or the other sort of look look all my trips or in this basket and I'm just as long as it's going well I'm doing well but the other side of those people are just in the ... camp they look look we're just putting money in central banks have got lots of good rationale be very defensive basically cash\nUnder the mattress goal you know and the extreme cases but we see it but we see so that's not as positive obviously but people do that in spite of many of the positive things that we've been seeing bases loaded no outs\nI like that you like that that's my that's my philosophy yeah bases loaded [laughter]\nI like it to like a to a va look there's lots of things that were charging that we'll talk that Russia Russia that

slow metabolism\nWhat to slow metabolism have to do with anything if I took even the fattest person even these three hundred four hundred pound people and I put them in a concentration camp and I fed them very little each day we didn't know type it all they would get right back down to normal body weight\nAnd eventually be skinny but people eat too much the basic premises they're eating like normal people but normal in our society is not normal for our body\nI can cut my calories back from four thousand forty five hundred calories a day I could cut it all the way down to ... thousand twelve hundred calories a day and survive and feel great doing it and not even be hungry\nBut I Know they're so my basic premise because my life early dreams were to get in shape\nWas to find out the basis\nFor being in shape\nAnd many people believe that exercise is the secret they believe go into the gym and working out makes them healthier makes them look better and you see these guys got big arms and big bellies at the gym\nAnd they're puffing and huffing and screaming and yelling and pick it up heavy weights and drop them on the ground\nBut are unhealthy their fat out of shape and they don't realize in their brains they're working out they're healthy but in reality they're just ... was a little bit extra muscle\nNow why am I saying I'm not saying this to pick on anybody don't get me wrong what I'm saying is their basic premise that if I lift weights I'm healthy is wrong\nAnd so they will never be physically fit and they will always be fat even if they work out that they stop working out to be fat with muscle with less muscle if they work out we'll be back with more muscle but their fat has nothing to do with exercise I\nKnow I get on these kicks where I go when I Do aerobics I Do an hour two hours a day of aerobics just because I get crazed\nI Know that aerobics isn't the secret to what my body weight is I Know that diet is the secret what my body weight is I Know the road which is good for your heart and your lungs you circulatory system I get that I Know that's true but an hour or two hours a day every day is too much in fact right now like I got crazy with that last week on my knee hurts\nBecause overdue did like in two hours of treadmill the other day and now my over extended mighty and you know the problem is when you start with the basic premise that's wrong you're can't hit highest potential at all [noise]\nAnd I want you to understand is when you start basic conscious when you're base assumption is wrong\nThe level of success that you can accomplish will never be anywhere near as high as if your base assumption is correct in fact in almost every case what's going to happen is is that your bad basis option is going to stop you from being able to accomplish what you want to do\nGive me another example I um\nSigned a couple of years ago when I had cancer that I was going to start playing with toy drinks and build myself lay out\nAnd got a lot of information same thing I Do everything else in life I go get a lot of information I read a study of learn and then you know you're dying to jump in and get started and I put together man this training layout that\nWas really unique unique that the right word for it was large would have helped me through the large and\nIt was interesting as I went along and I continue to read more material I found out that I had made some basis options in the very beginning were just wrong just wrong and because of them\nI hit sticking points that could not be overcome I pick\nThe wrong gauge train to get the maximum amount of lay lay out of shape and size uh I picked the wrong types of strains and had to sell them all back I bought a whole bunch of trains sold them all back and bought new ones because\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThe and so forth so now I've got\nTens of thousands of dollars a track that I'm going to have to sell back\nAnd I'm buying new track to replace it um the base platform that I built for it\nOr I built it as just one big monolithic base which left for no ability to create really mountains and terrain and valleys and rivers\nAnd so instead I didn't know how to do open open construction construction girders construct or whatever they call it to be able to build this lay out with all these different levels and things that I really want on it\nAnd I thought I could do by just starting with a flat piece of board but the world is flat\nFlat board doesn't represent terrain and beauty and so really have to take the whole based apart now I'm back to re doing all the track all I read all the trains already but we do all the track or they don't really have to go back and redo the base\nAnd then redo the track and then I'll be the new level where now I can make some more mistakes right above all kinds of power I thought I knew lots of power to run these strange about way more power than when I Need but it may not be the right power it may not be set up the way I Need to send\nThere's all kinds of things that I Will not be able to accomplish because I started this thing\nAll wrong or friends how's your fitness how's your finances how's your

do on the radio show today we're discussing the topic of how you see the problem is the problem and you can't solve the problem at the same level of taking\nThe problem was created at and what are the basic premise that are trying to make here today for everyone to pick up is that if we start with the wrong basis the theory that you're working from is wrong\nThen everything you do is not going to lead to success it's going to somehow stop somewhere along the way to stop you for becoming successful what you're trying to accomplish and I've said this is true and everything for fitness is financed family health\nOr whatever topic it is whatever it is a life you want to accomplish you are going to fail if you start with the wrong base theory on this thing\nNow I'm going to take one step further make it even more complicated right or the next level of complication I Want to bring to you is it in in our lives\nWe all have personalities and\nI don't know if this is true I asked this question more than make a statement but I Would assume most people think their personality is the right personality in other words they created demeanor that they think is acceptable acceptable and\nSuccessful for them to get through life so some people think the ... the way to go through life some people think that means a protective or angry or you know they think they're going to get more by approaching the ...\nWell this way and so they have these personalities and that base personality itself\nIn my mind has a limitation I mean how far can you get as a grumpy old man how far can you get as hateful person a but see that's my belief system\nI may be wrong on that may be a hateful grumpy person can accomplish way more because they don't have any outside um distractions they don't listen to anybody else you know maybe that is the right way\nI have is they can get more flies with honey\nRight but that's an assumption and the point I'm making three is not only do we have\nAssumptions about specific things like finances right and the assumption that like you to think about today about find as as you don't have to work to be rich you don't have to work to make a living my assumption is you can create enough pass some income\nTo replace you earn income and retire in two to five years that's a pretty strong base assumption now I've been teaching for twenty seven years and for the last twenty seven years it's been working for people that put it to work and who actually except to remember what\nThe polling hill said whatever the mind demand conceit and believe it can it cheap so we can see and we believe that we can retire between two to five years\nMight take seven I used to say it was seven because I didn't know that we could do it even faster after we've proven that so many times over and over again people started going why am I going to wait seven\nI'm just going to go and get it done in two that's my goal and since we told stories of how I retired two and a half years people going well the two and two and a half years I Do too I'm you know he started with no money he was you know work in a health club\nSo these base assumptions but now I'm taking it even further your base assumption on a factual things like how to make money which is very very important\nRight let's take that back one step and say okay what about just the general overall functions in life wow now this brings me to an interesting topic\nIn my summer I talk about the tale of two was the two types of people that I run into\nAnd being a teacher and mentor a I had to figure out how to deal with each of these two different kinds of people because they both failed on their personalities and it was just based personality failure it had nothing to do with the material has given the same material to both people\nAnd both people were failing but there were failing in a different manner so I like to talk about the difference between the type a personality type B personality type a personalities someone with instantaneous gratification disease they want everything they want and they want it all and they want it right now\nAnd they have these needs\nTo get what they want it that they're driven when they want something they are insane or in my fiance is one of these type days and stuff she does it based there is if she wants something shooting on her phone get on the Internet and she will shop for twenty four hours straight until she gets what you want\nI mean it's just to watch or it's ferocious now on that same side of her that ferocious knows
