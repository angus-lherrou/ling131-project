{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Then one of the ... a couple of things you can do I mean again let's have a winning retirement plan a endless start said his goals to get you get yourself away from these type a target\nAnd number one I'll tell you is saving more than six percent or you know I'll even go further I think you should be saving um additionally above ten percent okay and if you're if you're behind then obviously you need to be saving more finding anything you can do to increase your savings but only four one K. is something that many of us have access to\nA probably by far is the largest retirement vehicle out there\nAre some areas four one K. is it allows you to harness that kind of a compound growth okay I mean that's the key without paying tax me you'll pay tax later on\nAnd there's some things you want to watch out for later on just keep in mind if you're young\nDon't be lured in by you don't pay tax till later and don't get caught that you might be in a lower tax bracket they met that may not be true\nFor many of you who are young now I can tell you the for the baby boomers who all we kinda got they got kind of pushing the St play many of them are finding out taxes probably will not be lower for them we see that all the time so keep a good spread on where you save your money\nBut for one case do allow that to grow a you know tax free until you pulled out obviously so you get that compound and so a little bit more that savings now makes your nest egg a lot bigger um ... you know because of that compound interest guy so\nMake sure you're saving into your plan a that's going to be a key and then also if there's a match let's just say you're getting started out and you're not able to put into your playing with the matches the free money so at least\nStarting out come up to the match and get that free money and to make it a growth in the habit to to ... every year increase your contributions until you get to the maximum contribution so and two thousand Eighteen at four O. one K. if you want to get a max Eighteen thousand five hundred for folks that are younger than eight fifty\nSo if you're over age fifty twenty four thousand five hundred for those that older so\nYou should buy them by Fifteen\nYou should be hitting us max is to make sure you do everything you can't do that so the other thing is what are some things to avoid every now and then um you know we'll get a call somebody needs money they need men they have maybe a IRAs and\nThey have a four O. one K. at work and other things and they say how do you to get some money out of my four one K. should I take a loan\nAnd it's very common to use as a matter of fact many people use uh the loans and it's easy to go get that money out of four one K. but it's also like robbing a good investment okay because what you probably don't know is you have to pay back that loan with after tax dollars\nSo you don't get to put free tax dollars in there or to pay that loan officer you're kind of in a disposition trying to pay back that low which makes it very expensive\nAnd if for some reason you have to leave employment uh you've got to pay that loan back in that year so that you got to be careful there are some things that could get you there so I Would tell you\nA void or avoid taking loans and look at other alternatives out there I Would rather someone to look at their home equity take out a reasonable loan and pay that back then take out there for one case but just there's other ways you can get money if you're in that type situation that happened to dip into your four one K.\nThing asked for advice and support you know according to bank rate twenty six percent of Americans get retirement advice from an investment professional that's pretty low now I Know many people will resort to family and friends\nAnd I would tell you a just unless they're an expert\nYou know maybe a broad advice maybe maybe if they tell you where to say\nBut avoid the detailed avoid those family you know people that think they are professionals at everything and find a real professional to get advice I mean and also their services there there's really are so many things out there with technology you can at least get some sort of a vice to help you\nAre but you have forty six percent of people do you not to be one or see goodbyes according to spank write articles so you know again it's kind of kind of discouraging but I think you need good advice be good mentoring to get where you want to go so especially staying on a savings path it can be very easy to be deterred\nAnd be taken off that Paso having someone help you and get the advice that you need\n'em so retirement calculators that's easy resource out there it's a it's not\nThe full thing that I think you would need but is it leads to start so plugging the numbers if you're starting to save okay if I'm putting X amount of dollars\nAre in now pre tax do I say some after tax and plug those numbers are assigned a reasonable growth rate maybe five or six percent growth\nBut put in historical inflation around for so you've got about two percent growth over inflation and the kind of see what those numbers you know take you out to sixty six out to age Seventy if you think you can retire early and plug into earlier figure and see what that looked like\nA but use those calculators to give you a general direction of where you're heading do not count on those to be exactly where you're going to be because so many factors can happen number one you could basically come off your savings plant\nLife life happens right things will happen or you know what inflation may not be as bad as you calculated into can be better medical costs to beat in fact with is that it can be worse so keep in mind also growth rates I mean you can't make the assumption you're always going to get five or six percent per year\nSo you know having some other tools Monte Carlo simulations that are basically look at many many different markets scenarios usually about a thousand is probably suffice to see where your probability of success will lead and usually I like this probabilities of success has to be in the nineties okay so those are other tools you can use but you know\nComplete financial plan is where you eventually need to be so maybe if you're starting out or you know right now the the calculators kind of get you there but if you're that ten years from retirement and you have not done a comprehensive financial plan and I'm not talking about plugging the numbers in to see if you don't run out of money\nOne that's going to talk about distribution how are you taking those distributions and where are you taking them from\nHow are they tax one that talks about how your state's going to be tax was passed on do you have all those things coordinated that need to make sure you pass it on not to Uncle Sam but you pass it on to your family so you're just sometimes beneficiary designations are those little just little nuances cause I think a lot of times people do what they do\nIf you hadn't lost your job\nThen you wouldn't had a problem of losing your equity\nInteresting\nHow do we see that so wrong how do we invented our minds at our mistakes\nBy feeling totally satisfied that the economy is booming that our family can now afford to make a big purchase into a house we really can't even afford to own\nHow can we blame that on the economy\nIs not real estate that did that to you I was in real estate during those were sections two thousand two two thousand eight I made money during those years during those recessions I made money I never lost any real estate\nBut I wasn't in the position that these people were in which was just like Dave Ramsey I think also lost money in real estate at some point is if they had the wrong set up they had the wrong system the wrong financing system the wrong income based system\nBack in the eighties people bought real estate on purpose to lose money it was a giant right off that all of a sudden in eighty six eighty seven they took those right of way Reagan took those right off the way and guess what boom there was no reason to overpay for real estate anymore and real estate crashed\nWow\nSame thing happened two thousand eight all of a sudden people been speculated a real estate forever the economy gets off people lost their jobs\nAnd the rate of return on investment we need these returns become inverted when long term interest rates right are lower than short term interest rates\nYou have a problem in the economy long term interest rates should be higher\nThere should be a cost to taking money long and short term interest rates are\nThe easiest to figure out so they shouldn't costs you as much yeah I'm gonna get my money back within a year that does it demand the same risk and so now the big thing is you kind of talking about this in voted rate curve if the rate curve invert like it did in two thousand eight everything blows up they say\nBut yet when you read all the rest of the report\nRight if the fed doesn't do that if the fed doesn't mess it up and everything else looks rosy as can be now today if you can hang with me through the show [noise] I'm going to get to a point where explained you historically\nWhy I Believe this market is not overbuilt or oversold that historically were actually in a better position right now to buy apartment complexes\nThan we ever were or even rent houses it's just an incredible thing to see what's available out there\nSo when I go through this with you I Hope you can follow through this whole show because this is going to be a gigantic sales pitch to you not because I have something I Need to show you hadn't product to sell you have the concept to show you that if you're sitting on the sidelines and not building wealth\nYou have no assets that you're missing out that you're missing out ... was talking to me the other day he's got like twenty seven apartment complexes he's bought as many as thirty four [noise] Scott thousands and thousands tens of thousands of units\nAnd interestingly enough he said you don't do I've been buying for the last four years when people have been sitting on the sidelines because he thought the cycle had ended and now I'm way better off because of it\nAnd yet up all my friends and fellow investors pulling back\nBut I didn't and so now he's\nHindsight's twenty twenty says ... [noise] maybe just up and down fluctuation in markets is not that important maybe what's important is keeping your money invested in something that's earning money\nAnd his cash flow from all these investments is phenomenal now some are better than some are worse\nSome are great ... some have large capital so we have no capital gains\nBut in whole his portfolio is truly invested\nThoroughly invested that is what he looks at his job as in life is to keep the family business invested so it's making money because what good is money sitting in a four one K. that or do nothing what good is money sitting in an IRA that aren't you nothing what good is money sitting in your paid in full home with germs you up and\nHow was that benefitting your family\nAs opposed to having it in businesses that are money now you could have it in savings and mostly it was ... about a half a percent although online saved accounts now we're up to one and a half percent I've just transferred a bunch of my aunts my savings accounts into these online savings accounts to get that extra one percent interest\nBut theoretically Dutch ridiculous compared to owning a piece of real estate which could earn your six seven eight ten twelve Fifteen Percent depending on the deal\nToday I've got to make this point you\nGet it across to you that you need to be invested in this market and why two thousand Eighteen is going to be better than two thousand Seventy at every economist everyone bar none that I've read saying the same thing\n[noise] two thousand Eighteenth going to be better to two thousand Seventeen and did you better get invested wow where did the cycle go\nWell that's what we need to discuss because I have a theory about cycle expansion that might make sense to the whole thing what if we change the entire shape of the curve is still a curve butter change\nWill discuss that and more when we come back to the Dell wildly radio show\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio you know we'll be right back with more than my principles of justice\nLifestyles unlimited the real\nEstate investor education and mentoring group that has been taking people by the hand and teaching them\nHow to invest in real estate twenty eight years our students have been so successful at creating wealth and income that they among local state and national invest Rubio more well over the last well do you think real magazine named them back I mean if you're ready to Amarillo only lifestyle\nShop dot com access\nRely on your back schedule\nYou have to decide I Will you get it right now is the wool over the world will go to class\nAfter Alan question do you think and that's the down off the setting that long uranium dot com or something entirely Matthew my son's down\nBy believes in good teacher has the skill set to be able to breathe\nLevels of learning different from one of the guy\nYou know that every dollar you invest in real estate makes you money five ways cash flow money in your pocket each month equity capture the thousands of dollars you create when you have the right team and by the white property using the right mass\nFor months of expansion is the second largest expansion period in the history of the country\nAnd the point they're making is I mean how much further kind of go if we're almost to the largest expansion ever and my theory is this if there were fifty and sixty and Seventy month expansions and then somebody had a hundred and twenty\nIsn't there that opportunity for everything to align itself to where there could be a hundred and thirty a hundred and forty months of expansion somebody had to hit the hundred and twenty\nWord a hundred and four that's a long ways away but somebody had to set that record and some set of circumstances had to set that record\nSo let's take a look at our circumstances right now that play into me believing that the cycle has been stretched in fact completely interrupted in some cases but maybe that's an overstatement let's just say stretched out to where things don't work at the speed that we believe they would work at\nSo let's talk about the number one\nI Believe that the the value of it real estate\nIs controlled by supply demand and buying power so what do I mean by that well if we bring tons and tons and tons of units online\nThen all of a sudden we're over supplied rents have to go down occupancy has to go down and real estate values start to plummet people can't operate their buildings at a profit and so they have to sell they have to sell the lower price because they've got no financial to sell to that cetera et cetera et cetera\nAll right so let's talk about demand\nAnd demand is how many people there are two rent those units so if you had a large supply but you also had a very large demand they could neutralize each other and the property stay as profitable as they were\nIf you had a higher demand and supply then you're going to have an increase in profit and an increase in value\nOkay and then you have buying power\nHow easy is it for you to buy the real estate\nOut there on the marketplace well let's look at single family homes the buying power is going down why is buying power going down because the prices are getting very high and interest rates are starting to rise so the buying power is going away\nBut what's happening in commercial real estate is it there's more and more and more money to throw it real estate the buying power is unbelievable and interest rates are staying relatively fixed\nI mean I'm looking in interest rates right now I could get a deal if I wanted to go with an adjustable rate them only three point to seven I could get it fixed rate it four point five\nThat's phenomenal Thirty years with a ten year balloon at four point five interest only which really means you you it's like you're paying three percent\nIt's just unbelievable 'cause there's no you're not paying down the principal\nSo the the payments are very small this gives you a tremendous amount of buying power\nAnd the fact that there's tons of cash sitting around waiting to get into these deals gives you even more buying power so as the millennials come out in the world changes from\nYou know an old folks right to the millennials\nThey now have the belief that they don't necessarily want to own a home\nThey don't like upkeep they deliver with their parents have been ten it's for the first Thirty years of their life now to be ten it's with freedom of not living in mom and dad's house it's like total freedom they're spoiled and they want nice amenities so they can't afford to buy a little crappy home in a crappy neighborhood they're not going to do that\nThis all leads them to demand as more and more millennials are wanting to move in to the household world in other words own their own household by themselves\nThere's more and more demand for apartments and not as much demand for houses because they can't afford to buy those
