{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "People are still trying to interpret them and what they mean to them by the end the urine and and going into next year so it could cause problems if you're not aware of them\nHave been great experts and have a good team we stay on top of that so recently there's been changes in the tax rules for partnerships and some El Al ... and there's many different reasons we have clients that have Elysees put together for you know a safety and ask for protection you got people that habit for passing on to the next generation's family limited partnership\nAnd somebody just have to do to protect interviews maybe they have real estate's for whatever reason if you have a partnership or an L. O. C. and you're under a hundred members which is probably the most of us I mean usually when you're over a hundred people your corporation or something else\nUh those tax laws are going to be a ... I'm going to matter so to give you a quick cliff notes version of the final regulations were recently published by the IRS and that affects businesses taxes partnerships with less than a hundred partners\nSo the classification of partnership would include general partnerships limited partnerships family partnerships in L. O. c.'s taxed as partnerships so just a quilt a quick clip notes\nIf you have any of those\nContact not your general practitioner not your general counsel I Would say a tax accountant\nI Would say a ... a certified to state attorney or somebody that is eight attacks strategist I think a lot of times people think mistake my tax preparers going to be a suit on these law changes and the and the most likely they are not I mean there's these changes were just recently done\nSo just you know be careful eagles and was not going to be the place I Would tell you to go for that so um so if you want that if you could pause you can go now call in and do that and take care of it is not\nLet me tell you a little bit of what we kind of how we broke down this a recent change after talking to several of our legal and tax experts you know we we basically are saying we're providing noticed you right now make you aware of these changes she can make the amendments your partnership agreement so it's making them image that partnership agreement\nNow these rules changes may require you to measure existing partnership Andrew Ellis III documents so that's basically you know that what you're going to have to look at so it's not the good news is shouldn't be too much um but you know being aware of this is going to be I think very critical so\nKind of what is the uh what is the change under the old rules the partnership was selected\nFor an audit by the IRS any adjustments result of the audit were passed through to each individual partner who would then be responsible for the taxes so remember these a pastor enemies or pass through to the partners those partners are then responsible responsible for the taxes now\nStarted in two thousand Eighteen the new rules apply so unlike\nPrior rules going forward all audit adjustments from the Irish are taxed at the partnership so it doesn't go to the flow through and it basically does not go to the partners is that the highest income tax for any particular end the partnership so just all I'm going to tell you if you don't make the adjustments\nInstead of flowing through to you you can be taxed at the highest possible right so I don't know about you but high taxes do matter I don't like paying high taxes so make the amendment call and and and find out about these new rules\nAnd don't be shocked if your CPA or whoever is it that helps you with this doesn't know guess what give us a call will send you this you hand them hand them what we mean basically put out for our clients\nAnd our listeners and let them figure that out and and help you make the amendment so why are the changes important to you all the changes basically create a problem by no longer passing on iris adjustments to individual partners\nInstead the partnership itself bears the obligation to pay the taxes which like I said that's going to be at the higher tax rates if those adjustments have been passed on so this could cause problems with prior tax benefits that just carry forward and other offsetting deductions\nDon't try to figure this out yourself just you know talked to somebody about it and make adjustments to the good news is the fix should be relatively simple and even better not expensive and that's the good news if you act upon it and do it don't procrastinate on these things because it could cause problems later on so I just think that this is something\nYou know if you don't have an attorney will be happy to help you and again back to your a practitioner back to ever helps you if they don't understand it again let us know we can send you to somebody that's pretty updated on these rules and knows what the changes could look at your Elsie agreement your partnership agreement\nAnd then ten seconds tell you this is the language that we need to change make the amendment you're done and good news\nYou'll have to worry about it matters particularly in an odd situation and you definitely as you said want to be aware of the changes that were to just making you aware of these new rules and changes and hopefully you can go in to take that information and apply it and get yourself set up in a better way for these limited partnership several seasons sort of other pass through entities\nUp by the way kind of a cool discovery apparently Mike on his toes are subject to money sometimes that's OK archeologist found that they believe they've seen now the world's oldest intact shipwreck at the bottom of the black sea\nIs well it's basically it appears to lay and and just undisturbed there for more than twenty\nFour
