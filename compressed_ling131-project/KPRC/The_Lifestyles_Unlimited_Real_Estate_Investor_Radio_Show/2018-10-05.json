{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "We never recommend getting all out and then trying to get all back again that's why you got to be very careful if you guide yourself and you use your position you're in you adjust your positions\nThen you won't be caught off guard but we know so many people ... question earlier was\nHow many people do we know that have sat out since two thousand eight or many because something spooked them out they didn't have a discipline\nAnd that they may have had a discipline to get out but how do you ... back in how do you adjust and get back in while I was looking at some ah good research today and very respectable people and they're talking about the price to earnings ratio and the U.S and the right now is twenty two point three\nSo if you kind of take the average in the past forty years is twenty point too\nSo I mean even if you were to accept them the price to earnings ratio as the gospel okay and many people do as a matter of fact I think a lot of the bears narrative has formulated around us now loop we don't think that's the only thing out there that you look at there's many other metrics okay well let's just say that you do and that's that's the one thing you fall in us are going to follow\nWell it looks like equities only appear to be about ten percent overvalued if you look at it in a forty year comparison\nSo that doesn't sound like this massive bubble\nRight so if you then take a look at the that it is you take the ... the ratio the for the ratio sixteen point nine okay so that leaves the room right now in theory to get back to the forty your average of twenty percent rally now people may be screaming right now out your St twenty percent more alley in stocks no\nI'm just saying if you compare the forward to the forty your average is you're looking at twenty percent higher so when you get caught off guard on one of these articles that are talking about\nUh you know the the market's extremely overvalued will go look at it in the some of the other context is look at some of the ratios out there I mean it's not that stretch and I think if you're going to light up on the narrative that the market could run a little bit more\nThink about this what is the other alternative\nAnd many people don't have that what else are you going to invest in right now where do you feel confident where do you feel safe I mean look at the flight of capital that we've talked about and the flight of capital is still buying\nUS dollar denominated assets and that can continue for a while I Do think that it's going to be difficult longer term that us as the only growth engine and the world right now and the rest of the world falling behind that's going to come to some mean at some point I Do agree with that\nBut don't think it's going to happen tomorrow and this is why you know to this point having a discipline will will keep you from making these mistakes and many of the investor mistakes are they sell out and now that we get a little bit of volatility because we haven't had it in so long you start to panic and what we've had in the last couple of days should not even\nLeave a mark it shouldn't even give you a concern but if it does then you have the wrong\nStrategy or don't have one at all the worries are generally the case or they'll have say are they've got this great buying strategy but no nothing to sell necessarily but I'm Mike you until everybody we were last night\nI was a contemporary art or a a fair that's basically going on George ... through the weekend it was pretty as Texas Texas artist and international Mexican artist as well so yeah what what kind of art like paint contemporary I mean just to either sculpture there's some stuff that you look at it and you're like OK I'm going to tell you this\nThere was a the biggest a piece there was a bamboo pole and behind the black campus and\nThat's it and it was worth two point five million dollars and you stand there and you look at it and you're like wow okay why\nUm that that was at least and then you know some people say well it's because of the name I forgot the name I'm not really big into that but it was apparently because of the name of it would be like a Costco you could look it up a causes some were there and they looked terrible book because it's a ... so it's worth a lot of money and what was funny as ours you\nSee that one because so I was a I Would just short thinking about this where you were talking actually is\nJust looking at the price of some of these things the auction recently yeah\nIn fact Neal Armstrong son is now putting some of his father's memorabilia and the thing the spacesuit and things the war in space uh upper auction a but do you see the price of some of these that gets me a little uncomfortable as I began to feel like this more\nThis thing is a little frothy from that standpoint uh there's a probable cause so uh displayed in Christie's a hundred and Seventy nine million\nThree hundred and sixty five thousand ...\n... the difference between memorabilia and art you're talking to yeah yeah like yeah I'm just\nSaying well you know um but I have a bottle of whiskey what was that you ... yesterday I'll start you I'm sure you saw that a Nineteen twenty nine\nThe gallery six okay back to twenty six McCowan in two thousand seven went for Seventy five thousand dollars okay basically recently is twelve left one just went from one point one million now I'm gonna tell you that is because of central bank excess liquidity is ... you know creating speculation\nCreate an excess well Ari two fifty GT oh\nForty eight point four million dollars for that I get that because you can drive that the whiskey I don't get yeah what do you do look at it I mean are you going to be wow that was one point one million dollars\nThat's more money the audience right there that is more ... says but artwork it does keep I mean ... and I actually asked us and people last night I was like OK I we've seen appreciation\nAnd they've seen a lot appreciation and art which makes sense I mean you have one of the biggest central bank bubbles in a world the wealth effect in the world so you're gonna see are pushing higher so out of swagger baseball card\nOh yeah the original point two million dollars for a baseball card\nThat okay I get it I mean yeah I mean its value by then it hopes will get where further appreciation right [noise]\nUm that's a lot a lot of money man yeah I'd love to be able to collect something like that and just you know have it as a ... it's it's just another form of your portfolio ... another\nI think some artwork at right now I'm at work yeah yeah twenty eight percent tax of ... about a month you know I did I go into like really yummy things hanging on the walls worth a hundred million dollar we got to get it ensures that is for one so you remember this costs of habit for part of me feels\n[noise] you know that can do a lot of good my my thing about yeah oh yeah you know ... my thing about art is if you have to smoke a joint to get it [laughter]\nIt's not art way if you ... left turn to if you can't put a piece of art and go\nThat route youthful look at like Andy Warhol thing you know I look at that and I go okay you know I'm not gonna smoke a joint to figure it out because that's a that's illegal ... light you couldn't figure out whatever you did [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] I don't know if I was just drink a bottle out God's for no yeah what do you live and then you might figure it out and not even so I stand on your head spin [laughter] maybe makes sense to you know\nDue to bet if you like arguments that drove around this weekend I mean if you have nothing to do I think it's a great if you are I think to well if you haven't made plans yet how 'bout that given ... so you're getting and then go\nYeah or somewhere else anyway thank you Michael for that insight into the website as well I've got to listen to the SBA money\nEven listening came for entertainment purposes home and you can smell\nAway and you can make money when you perform in is no guarantee a teacher and I think that Michelle\nShould be considered an offer more so than by forced out any security and to have an identity management and sit down face to face and Charles shot in LA do you\nThe SPA money our program funded by NBA well\nGood you have more than one copy of on the head of the policy and completed a magazine at our website\nAt ... dot com than a mile dot com or color Mr angry at ... contract that he may wind keep you have [noise]\nTime how many ... Fox the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh heading for us final vote in the U.S Senate tomorrow after clearing a key hurdle today mainly along party lines sausage Aaron Halpern live on the hill\nThat fifty one forty nine vote was on a motion to limit debate in it sets up a likely Saturday confirmation vote the ideals of justice that have served our notion\nSo that deal all worked out well but the point was is it the reason I could bail him out with 'cause I was more liquid than he was my money was sitting in a savings account and not in a money market account or not in a CD where they could freeze your money and\nWhat happened here what I Want you to get as I'm Talking with this lady and other explaining this to or we don't want your money and CDs we don't want your money money market account or just could be disastrous for you you can't be liquid enough to make a move\nAnd so she says well I've looked as savings accounts and she had found savings accounts that went up to um well most sacred cows right now by the way are paying about point six percent that six tenths of a percent\nAnd she's said you know I talk to my some financial person that she knows somebody was and they said they could get her a point one a one point eight percent return as you said how does that compare that so that's pretty good but we got other considerations look at here is a very large amount of money\nAre you going to put all that and one bank account\nRemember FBI savings you know the federal government's insurance FBI churns FDIC insurance is only a good up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per person and two hundred fifty thousand per per sons on the account so the first thing that I I explain to her that she didn't understand yet\nBut she went back to a financial planner and through this animal is is that if you have more than one person on a savings account which could be you your spouse you can even put your kids or\nYou can have up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of insurance per person who would get the money out of that account if you would die so in other words if you um find them as beneficiaries of the account\nEach person that would be beneficial ... of that account would have the guts\nEnsuring up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of that account\nSo I said with a large chunk of money you have I'm gonna have to give you about five different accounts that one's okay one point eight fine I gave her some over two percent money I gave her to present Monday I gave her one point nine five they gave her at one point nine they gave her one point eight five shrubbery at one point eight\nAnd I said you need to spread this money out over these different account so that you get the FDIC insurance\nAnd if you spread it out far enough right you've got to have that insurance because you can put your your yourself your husband your kids or whatever you want to put on there's beneficiaries and get that insurance\nAnd so we figured that allowed or they but they what was interesting was after that it always turns around to the same conversation I had this conversation Curtis I have it with everybody I've talked to and that is that money in that bank is not hurting you anything even if it's two percent interest which is three times what point six is right\nIt's over three times it's a three hundred percent increase from we're\nNormal people seem to ...\nEven with that three times earnings power it's nothing cared to compared to a piece of real estate\nSo today we don't want to do is I Want to look at what is real estate do how does real estate make you so much money so much more money than traditional investments also want to debunk myths\nAnd the myth is the stock market out performs real estate this is a myth discourage only by people that are completely agree at trying to sell you stock right the stock market does not outperform realistic\nI've never met anybody\nThat got rich by owning stocks\nI Know rich people who own stocks\nBut I've never met anybody who got rich by owning stocks I Know people who have gotten rich by owning real estate\nAnd I also know rich people who put their money back into real estate so it's an oxymoron thoughts the same thing with gold I Know people that are rich who own gold but I've never met anybody tells me that they got rich by owning gold gold stock market\nThese types of things are place holders there a place to put your money because you don't know what to do with it where should your money ...\nIf it's not real estate guys it should be in your own personal business businesses make large amounts of money for people who own them the richest people in the world let's talk about oh Bill Gates yes it was talking about upcoming uh talk about Warren Buffett these guys didn't make their money in the stock market yeah the whole stock\nThey went public they made their money by owning the companies that went public and benefiting from the rise in the stock when they owned already billions of dollars' worth or hundreds of millions in a small company\nBut people don't get that they seem to think that they got rich because we're in the stocks no\nThe stock market is a place to raise capital to make ... rich so\nWhenever I'm not buying real estate I'm starting companies and I've got many different companies and that started many many many companies over the years some of them didn't make any sense I let him go some of them worked out really well kept them going you know but companies make money real estate makes money\nStocks bonds\nCDs\nSavings accounts they're just a place to harbor your money to put it stored and hope that there is some increase\nThe reality is the increased might not even keep up with inflation now sometimes is really good run up some stocks that that occurs there's no doubt about that but there's also times when there's run down\nAnd I guess if you were smart enough to stay in the stock market crashes and not lose your cookies over it\nYou probably could be okay if you're just stuck it out because of the long haul the stock market like real estate values go up and down up and down up and down but most people get freaked out when they see the money go way the stock market because it might not be at the right time in their life\nBut a real estate we don't worry about that time because it's always a good time to get the red in the mail and to make actual will take a short break we'll be right back with the Dell wildly radio show [noise]\n\n\nYou're listening to the

here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time\nBombs\nWill go back to do a lousy radio show today I'm Talking about six different reasons why real estate\nOut performs the stock market as far as earnings and or any other investment that I Know of per se um we've talked about number one which is equity capture which is over the hill I'm just ... unbelievable number two is cash flow\nNo this is an interesting concept\nThat I've never understood that many many people live don't have any expectation for cash flow from their investments and I ask you this\nDo you own a single family home how much is a pay per month\nFor that you know the privilege of having all your family's equity in the answer is nothing\nIf you own a four O. one K. what does it pay you per month for the privilege of having all your money's equity in it and the answer is nothing that IRA what does it pay nothing knows get stocks most dogs pay no distributions some however they did it\nUm so you got like one of the best dip it in stocks out there which most people don't most people have nothing coming up with this dog as far as the evidence but if you're one of the best of it in stocks out there you might or four percent right that's a pretty hefty number considering nothing is the average so if you look at that and\nThen you look at cities right now CDs you can earn up to three and a half percent other CD a savings account you gearing up to two percent of the savings account right now\nI'm In by the way when you go CD for three and a half you're going out I think five years to get that pretty sure I'm tired of your money so you've got all these ways earned income but then when you look at real estate our worst deals the ones that you know we consider our\nBread and butter you're just going to get what you get type of deal is going to\nProve out to be somewhere between on cash flow bases between five\nTo Fifteen Percent and on good deals and this could be anywhere from ten to twenty percent now in some rare occasions when you're buying single family houses\nYou can get even higher than twenty percent I've seen twenty four twenty five in the old days we get thirty forty fifty percent but that's the old days is not today's marketplace and you know remember these are the deals that are just the exceptional deals\nAre they still out there yes they are still find them yes we do but can I say that we can get you won every single day the answer is no these are the exception deals but you can go out there all day long and swing a golf club and come back with a ... single family cash flow up ten percent\nFifteen Percent that's easy to do a apartment complex as you can earn you know anywhere from seven to ten percent of the first year\nAs you own them you get them in better shape you increase their income controller expenses I've seen those casualties go from seven to eight nine ten I've seen some or go to twelve Fifteen Percent um\nSome deals that are rehab deals I've seen them jump up into the twenty ... percent mid twenties\nType of a deal so what does that really mean will it means if your money's sitting in a savings account like as I spoke with this latest was let's get your money into something say that you won't lose your money it's FDIC insured will get it up to two percent at one point nine one point nine five one point eight five\nUm that's something to do it safe concerning small amount of money it's something to do but just as soon as you can get that money back into it eight percent return think about what that is if you're earning too\nRight if you're earning too and you went to for you would have an under one hundred percent increase in the rate of return if you're earning too and you could get the six that's two hundred percent\nRate of return in increasing red return and if you could get the eight that's a three hundred percent increase in ready to return I think about that that's a massive increase in rate of return\nThree hundred percent better not as you're seeing it five percent yes it's five percent higher return but percentage return increase is three hundred percent wouldn't you like to increase your profitability about three hundred percent\nSimple get into real estate get away from all these other investments you rent because real estate pays those
