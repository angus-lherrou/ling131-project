{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "In family wealth planning and in the last segment man you were talking about the people will specialties and every ... every profession has their inside joke CPA have CPA jokes radio guys have radio jokes or their\nTheir attorney jokes lawyer jokes but other specialized jokes within the specialty for for what you do I'm just curious\n... yes yes there there definitely are and ... every little specialty group has joked about the way the practice works that's that's definitely true gotta keep like you know\nWell it's one of those types of things that it's kind of funny I've actually had my estate planning documents updated three times the first one in my when my wife and I had kids you know when they're all things then several years later we want it to maybe take care of my mother in law and there were some people changes\nAnd then the third time to time we change it most recently it's because we wanted to get some of those people that were named his executives and trustees outta there you know so sometimes it's those people but I have met\nEstate planning people that have an updated their estate planning quite a long time sometimes the cobbler has no shoes on [laughter] well that's exactly what we're hearing sta well one of the things that I have a lot of passion for is working with business owners owners are closely held business and sometimes it's doing things like by cell agreement sometimes is coordinating\nMultigenerational wealth plans\nAre but with business owners they're unique situations especially if it's a business where the owner of the business of the father of the mother owned a business and they want to quote keep it in the family we were in the steel and is that we talked about good\nMaybe you can talk about some of the bad in terms of family succession plans within a business\nSo this is an easy subject where things can get bad uh\nI think I'll I'll generally label the most common situation where we see bad as family members stuck in business together\nWhen they don't really want that uh and when I say stuck in business together it could be as simple as they own assets together and they they can't really do anything about it or it may be that they literally have a you know an interest in a business and all of them have an equal interests and\nMaybe NO PLAN was made for control they just were given some equity interests and uh they have to figure it out\nAnd in those situations\nIf you've got the perfect family great they can sort it out and whether it's siblings or whoever the parties are they can come to an agreement and they can\nAmend interest state the partnership document or whatever we're talking about that's the good remember we're talking about the ugly exactly that's what I have the ugly is that they can't do that and right when we get to that point\nAnd we have litigation or one party believes there is no way for them to be treated fairly\nBy other members of their family and fairly is pretty subjective\nFairly is very subjective everyone has their own view everyone has their own lawyers which makes it very difficult when the family really can't communicate anymore without having the lawyers and involves\nA and so that that's the perfect example of of bad I mean you you can't we talked about communication at the beginning of the show\nIf you are in that kind of a situation where your co owners of whatever the asset is in communication has failed you're always going to be in bad ah because when we're talking about any material amount of wealth\nPeople get crazy over money and we all know that it just it it changes something about the way we can interact with each other even our own family and so when I went up plan hasn't been made for how multiple people are going to own an asset and managers\nThen we we get into some some nasty situation or something\nWell I've seen I've seen bad situations about what happens to mom and dad's house\nOr or even about the photo albums when you're talking about a family business that's hard to do it I mean the the men and women that run family businesses are working forty fifty sixty hours a week if you're having this distraction in terms of this planning what are the odds you to be done good so you said it's can be very difficult\nYou know whether it's by your own plans or whether it's by an act of God whether it be a premature death or maybe dementia maybe you can talk about what's shift a little bit back to the good what are the things you should do I'm assuming you would say the mother the father riding the business\nThey shouldn't wait because they don't want to have the conversations there's probably some best practices in terms of communicating and maybe building these plans\nYeah there definitely are not and it's going to be unique to every family to determine what the best processes for communication but the most important point that comes out of what you just said is that we all have\nAn end point to the lives that were going to live and during that life we have an opportunity to either\nExpressed the vision we have for the wealth we've created in the business we may have created or we're not going to do that and when we fail to communicate the vision for the next generation or whoever beneficiaries are\nThat's where we get a lot of these bad situation so I think that the the first key takeaway is if you haven't talked to your children or whoever you're beneficiaries are\nAbout what your plans are and what you think will work and uh who's going to run things and who's not going to run things and whether you've made specific gifts to some people and not others\nFirst we need to think through that with people you trust and have a good team put together to help you consider some of those ideas and second if that is the right thing for your family\nWe should consider how to communicate that while we still can't and it's not someone else trying to interpret your goal when you're not here well\nIt may be those sometimes parents typically on average the majority of the times don't want to have these conversations with their children they're uncomfortable that they feel like they're treating their children on equally one of the things we have I have two boys\nA lot of us like to check the box office saying I put I find that this kid's college so I Want my second son's college paid for and if I put a hundred thousand for him I Want a hundred thousand for him\nBut a lot of times it can't be so if you if you're running a hearing business and you have three children one's an engineer\nA one's a school teacher and one is an actor\nThey aren't going to have the same skill sets in most likely the engineer will be most likely the one that could run the company so having that conversation\nI think it's probably better for them to have the conversation now than to have the kids figure it out when they're gone or incapacitated\nRight and being able to say something like\nWe didn't put the engineer in control because we loved him or her more we put the engineer and control because we wanted to maximize value for all of you and that's the person who has the skill set and the desire to do that and not hearing that from your parents\nIs is what may cause some trouble well you've heard this planning for family wealth you don't have to be a billionaire to have these problems sit down and talk to your loved ones about what you wind up happening give 'em that great legacy the your hard work has given you have a great weekend we'll see you on Monday on the icy and money are\nInto it for entertainment purposes home and you know\nMarkets dealing with and you can make money when you\nTo being a twenty year old kid is what I Would say a lot of money or you know I don't know how much you would consider ... way back\nThen oh let's say\nLet's say thirty forty years ago I was making a anywhere between fifty Seventy thousand dollars a year as a kid that's pretty good I think I'm not sure there might have been people making a lot more but you know I didn't have a college education I'd never college degree and\nI was making pretty sizable money considering that I didn't really have any overhead as a kid I was able to save quite a bit of money and I saved up what I Would consider quite a bit of money hungry thousand two hundred thousand someone every inch of can't remember exactly get acts it's very hard for me to think back that far because I don't really care\nAnd revisionist history is something everybody makes up anyway so [noise] but\nThe reality is I had some money\nNot a lot but to me it felt like it was pretty comfortable until I lost it all the stock market\nAnd I say all that wasn't all that but it's a good portion of it was a good bike or and then I started buying houses in my thirties twenty five thousand dollars a house and I did that all the way up to house has got to fifty thousand dollars per house\nAnd when I was buying them at twenty five it was because they were they were on sale from fifty so the median price was fifty but we could buy stuff in foreclosure twenty five when it got back up to fifty I go you know there's probably no reason to be in real estate anymore it's over\nSo I got out and didn't really engage in anything at the time and this was only for a year a few\nMonths to you I'm not sure really might even not even been that long but I decided I'd better go do something else I looked into multi family and I started by small apartments\nAnd um because I could buy the cheap I could buy them at ten thousand dollars a unit eight ten eight nine ten thousand most expensive ones I republic Thirteen thousand a year when it first started I thought that was really over paying [noise]\nPrevention I got up to Nineteen thousand a door and then I knew I was over paying\nAnd those same properties today was self or fifty or sixty thousand dollars a door but at that time I thought I was over paying because I had started it you know eight nine ten thousand door got up to fourteen then I went to Nineteen was the last one I bought an old man I really overpaid for this\nUm and now I think about it and\nI think back and think I should have bought everything I could have bought\nI could have got my hands on more money I could have syndicated more deals I could have done you know stuff if I wanted to because I just sort of took it at whatever pace I could take it that thinking I didn't wanna overextend myself or make a mistake but the problem is now that I'm sixty two years old the problem is now\nThat's thirty forty years later ... well I could have burned\nI bypassed no\nDon't get me wrong too well for myself and I'm not trying to put myself down a notch tried to brag I'm just trying to tell you the truth that no matter how well the I Am right\nI'm I bypass up it's pretty amazing I could have had ten times more and more and a half and I I Believe that if there is a blame I Would um pencil in that\nI didn't want to go backwards rule number one don't lose money on last Monday the stock market but I had been trained into believing that failure was a massive option that you know it could happen and I didn't want it to happen that the markets go up and down up and down up and down up and down that could take somebody out\nBut I Lived through all the market's going up and down up down up and down and it never took me out in fact they never even really hurt me when the markets were crashing down I was happy because I could buy stuff fifty cents on the dollar increase the income of my portfolio\nI was scared because I did not need to sell any of my old portfolio there was no reason to because I was living off the cash flow not off\nOf a job that I lost\nIt so why would I get rid of it it was cash flow\n[noise] so I had to overcome that each and every time the cycle cycle it up or down and so you go through that and [noise]\nWe get out there are two thousand eight market crashes again and all of a sudden I can buy real estate prices I was used to buy your ten Twenty years earlier and I did buy everything I could get my hands on or at least I didn't I bought everything I thought was exciting end up\nGetting my hands on and I bypass it again\nAnd ah you know I bought probably a thousand units in a year or two when I probably should've bought ten thousand units during the year or two\nBut again just conservative middle class American been trained to believe that you know you don't have to really go out there and kill it just sort of get by and I did that and ended up\nMaking millions of dollars on the stuff that I did buy but I couldn't make hundreds of millions I may actually make tens of millions on this stuff I bought I could have been hundreds of millions would have been more realistic if I would've done it at a more aggressive pace so here I see now in the markets back up again and people are saying well\nNo need to get it now prices are too high we need to let it go back down again and then I've got other guys like Curtis Hague just sitting here going like I've got a ... got forty apartment complexes nine thousand units\nA herb announced every other real estate guru out there in the world who says they're superstars Curtis has eight hundred billion dollars with the real estate [noise]\nSo for all the guys out there screaming yelling our number one I don't know how they can be number one of course it's got a hundred thousand real estate or how they would be number one in education when I have thirty eight thousand customers or I don't know how that could be number one says I've been doing it for twenty seven and a half years and they've\nGotten into it

back to do on the radio show um today we've been discussing how we've been educated out of success\nAnd financial freedom and we talked about how the schools have turned to send to drones that we can't think critically to solve our own problems so I read an article about a family where both of them were teachers they both made sixty nine thousand dollars a year reach\nA and they couldn't afford to live in San jose and so the husband is over driving at night\nSo let's talk about this for just a second\nIsn't it your responsibility to take care of yourself\nAnd if so they put themselves in this situation they're living in a problem that they created themselves will do what do you mean they created the problem the the the cost of living has gone up no no no that's the cost of living is not the problem there the problem\nSee that's what the liberals don't want you to believe they don't want you to believe it's your problem you created it they want you to believe that the rich people create ...\nSo let's talk about what the problem is number one problem is they want to live in California\nSixty nine thousand times too\nThat's uh Seventy seventies a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year you could live in Texas and you could live just fine but why can't you live in California well state income tax is one thing but here's another\nA Fifteen hundred square foot home costs six hundred and eighty thousand dollars why do you want to live in a state or a house that size costs six hundred and eighty thousand dollars that home in Houston cost a hundred thousand bucks or less\nAre you out of your mind believing that you have to live in California and yet you piss and moan and write articles about how teachers are suffering\nThe problem is not teachers are suffering the problem is no one has taught them how to supplement their income and so if they want to do something you know what if I wanted to be I just love cleaning toilets what if that was going to be my career\nWhat if I loved helping people out down at the shelter that's because that's what I wanted to give back to society I have the right to make that choice but I Do not have the right for society than\nTo be a for me to demand of society to allow me to live like someone who went out and got a good job made a lot of money or had great investments\nSo it is then thinking it's not their fault it really irritates me I Know you guys would list is right now you're going oh that's so mean it's not meaning it humanly normal to believe you should take care of yourself\nTo think otherwise is a brainwash situation that you're educational system is put you into there is no way\nThat a teacher\nProducers as much value as somebody that makes it a million bucks a year somebody making a million bucks a year it's helping thousands and thousands of people get a product get a service get something of value have a place to live\nAnd the teachers taking kids and teaching them at the same thing that we do right here in our home this week we have our annual\nChildren come to grandma's house and we've got all the children here and the grandchildren so all the children are millennials my fiance Melissa ... generation X. and I'm an old dude\nSo we've got people in the house or sixty two got people that are fifty we got a bunch of kids that are under thirty five hundred thirty four and then we got grandkids\nAnd it's so interesting to see how each generation believes more and more and more so they deserve everything\nThe babies the kids scream and yell if they don't get their way and you know that's how they're going to grow up you know that's a society they're growing into in the parents are ...\nThey know no better because they've been taught punishing your kids is bad you go to jail for spanking your kids you can't you know punish kids anymore you know it takes a village to raise a kid you can't do it by yourself blah blah blah blah blah you're creating disaster within your own family guys\nThese people solve the problem by either getting invested in real she now think about this one if ten years ago when they decided they wanted to be teachers or Twenty years ago when this I didn't want to be teachers they bought a couple of rent houses\nWell those rent houses would have gone from being worth a hundred and eighty thousand which they were ten years ago to six hundred and fifty thousand which they are now and they'd be multimillionaires", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
