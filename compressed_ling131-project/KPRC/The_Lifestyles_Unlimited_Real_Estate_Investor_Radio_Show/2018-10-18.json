drop both for four fifty points another bad day for the struggling stock market but again you can learn more and our thoughts and comments at the uh the website and you register weekly newsletter comes to each week it's free to you\nA lot of value there are so this week we talk about the abrupt market sell off should investors care we also have a technical commentary sector I Would actually this week and it kind of talk about some actions probably up to at least consider and so you know we kind of put or\nPut it out there yeah brought it up and it's you know really relatively they were you able people sort of make these broad comments or they'll sort of talked out both sides of their mouths and I understand that sometimes you can't take a hard line it's a little bit of a wait and see but you know if you're going to have a discipline and advocate for it but we'll we'll just put it out there you know\nAlso the retirements ... survival guide we have a website yes that's about thirty pages in as as we mentioned yesterday on the show that um it it does get updated because you know things change all the tax code changes and we take a look at it and given to revamp at every up\nAnd uh so that's out there are also for the website as T wealth dot com or ... or so if you want to avoid mistakes in your retirement accounts this year a will go work with checklist\nSurvey we're obviously heading towards the end of the year two thousand Eighteen people with individual retirement accounts IRAs and for one cage should consider that checklist to help them avoid some tax inheritance mistakes over the rest of the year and\nBeyond and most everyone does they should check their contingents secondary beneficiaries and take the requirement um distributions if they are\nSeventy and a half or older or having an inherited IRA you know what the rules are there but ah what other things retirement account on there should be doing between now December thirty first well here's a few\nOne will just say simply the timing matters the ability to proactively tax plan at the end of the years perhaps the most overlooked opportunity missed by many taxpayers and I think it's something to consider so tax reporting is after the fact tax planning can move the needle\nAnd help stack the deck in your favor so I'm\nNothing will separate from your money like the Internal Revenue service and some things can change and some things can't but for attacks respect them nothing changes after December thirty first so plan accordingly take the opportunity to plan get better outcomes\nNo two I saved review your beneficiaries so yes you have already you know this but when maybe even have done it already but it's still worth double checking and many times people check and say yeah that's good and go on with\nWhen it isn't good but tax deferred retirement accounts may be the world's best breeding ground for cost of mistakes they are large books written about this important topic of retirement accounts um and so look do a checklist like these are just review your beneficiaries quickly and that's okay if it's good you're happy with it move on down the road\nA I'll say another was careful with rollovers you have a spouse dies leaving a spouse as better fishery no problem\nBut no probate no tax time of death so long as the spouse rolls the account into an individual retirement account are irate it keeps the account where it was transfer the funds to the existing existing IRA opens a new i._r._a. with the funds\nHowever there is no provision they are is code for an IRA roll over to a non spouse beneficiaries so children and other airs camp role these funds into their own IRA\nWhat's more unless the parents did the right thing before they died in the child does the right thing after the death the child would could lose a third of the funds to the government in a pretty short period of time simply because they didn't print properly so what to do names Pacific beneficiaries on your retirement accounts naming\nTo the state or as per will can be costly don't make this mistake\nAnother important factor to keep in mind again and ah your retirement accounts by year ended consider a qualified Chernobyl distribution so for those Seventy and a half or older you are chairman inclined\nSending your charitable donations directly from your irate to the qualified charity before December thirty first two thousand Eighteen\nKeeps the distributions off your tax returns so that can help you so this reduces your adjustable gross income which is used and several formula to punish taxpayers such as reducing medical deductions and total deductions for some as well as potentially increasing your medical Medicare premiums so\nAh the qualified charitable distribution or QC de can be your entire are empty by the way it can help it could also be a portion of it or an amount that is greater than they are empty so the cue CD amount can count towards your R B for the year up to the annual maximum of a hundred thousand [noise]\nSo if you're ... you're inclined that might be an opportunity do if you're seven and a half or older and take with his arm D's consider a Roth conversion always a good thing to review keep the cuts the individual tax rates in the tax cutting JOBS Act of two thousand sifting Seventeen given those those cuts\nNow may be a good time to convert your traditional raw directly to a Roth IRA\nAt least part of it maybe many people find themselves a lower tax bracket\nAnd then they can give it a day can convert any qualified to couch or off Iran could be helpful to them so if you find yourself in a lower tax bracket the previous year you can talk to your CPA invite how some uh maybe we wiggle room for you and having your current tax bracket to convert to a raw direct polar pay lower tax rate\nAnd taxes may never be this low again so there's never been a better time to convert to Rob I write potentially if it's a urine to the right circumstances so keep that in mind and talk to your tax person\nAlso the deadline to reverse it Roth direct version for Seventeen is October fifty two thousand Eighteen\nSo have you done these other off lose any conversion to a Roth IRA and two thousand seventeenth can be re characterize back to an irate if the investment has not perform well two thousand Eighteen so just consider some of those are some of those you know end of the year checklist items to consider tax matters\nCertainly planning being careful those rollovers as well as reviewing you'd better fisheries to summarize\nAnd if that doesn't interest or you can always play mega millions on friday or Powerball on Saturday where the jackpot for mega millions is approaching a billion dollars\nWhat would you do with a billion dollars a share it with all my friends you would\n... have you kidding me man I Would change my name and go to move to bally I've never seen the guy getting plastic surgery what Saddam kids [laughter] you got about like you thought about that you got a better chance of getting bitten by a shark on dry land and you do a winning either one of these things that is true yeah\nIt's true though that you cannot win unless you buy a ticket that that is she right you will not what we don't like you all when that's for sure\nThat's almost guarantee [noise]\nI'd love to just have a wealth dot com register for our weekly news or animal terms of survival guide you are listening to the SPCA money our [noise]\nEven listening came in for entertainment purposes and you can\nAnd you can make money when\nHe turned around and I think that Michelle should be considered an offer for solicitation by forced out anything or any of you to have an identity and sit down face to face and shot in LA do you\nThe SPA many Alan ... program\nHis I asked the Avon\nYou have more than I Want to call the head of the and we did a magazine at our website\nAt ... dot com than a mile dot com or ... ... contract wine ATM may have been [noise]\nBrady found the secretary of state my pound ham briefing President Trump on his meetings in Riyadh and in Turkey which accuses Saudi Arabia killing missing journalist ...\nThere are lots of stories out there about what had happened we just going to allow the process to move forward [noise]\nI shouldn't be beholden and and relying upon a job a corporation the national economy or even a walled on me for that matter because that all affects your retirement savings\nWhen you think about retirement most people think of that and that that they can draw from when they no longer work just as you stopped trading your time somebody then all of a sudden you need to\nRely on that and that's and that's where most people start to come into a living off of a fixed income they're trying to live modestly as possible so that they can make sure that that that that provide\nFor them throughout their lifetime and retirement and all you know a lot of people think maybe yeah well I'm going to have my how paid off and so I won't need as many expenses or I won't have as many expenses than I won't need as much income\nBut the thing as many people how it all off poor because she's the only are coming in and she stopped trading your time alone could walk up in the retirement really about a nest egg it's all about\nHaving an income after you put on the work ethic walk the what I Am very real estate and I I Would like they'll consider myself relatively young my husband still in his forties and we really have no intention of retiring early on BLM productive with our our\n... through real estate investing both single family and multi family that I invested and now twenty until about eight years now within a spot that first\nFour years we will both able to replace what we were making out work\nWith our our rental income which is totally path of it comes in the mailbox so to speak well that's all it comes in every month without having ... for much more effort to it so passive income is definitely the weight by that time has an financial freedom\nAnd the the thing that I always tell people when they come in for during the initial consultation with me is that I Want them to get to the point where if they continue to work become their grave low that's just all extra and and that's very powerful to be able to turn that around\nIt really is and it gives people an opportunity to open up their lives and think about the things I'd like to do you know many people\nWork for years and years and they're not able to travel there are not able to um just do the things with their families you know you think about just a a trip to Disneyland with your family nowadays it's a it's a thousand of dollars if he's got a couple of kids\nAnd that's something he's out of reach for many Americans and other people would like to travel internationally and they'd like to start doing those things before they're officially retired or before they leave their jobs are so many people out there who loved the work that they do\nAnd for those that don't it allows them to save up and to look forward to the J where they can leave their employer and know that they will have the investments that they need right they can pour that all back into real estate to accelerate\nTheir retirement naturally what you teach people to do every day isn't it\nIt definitely doesn't celebrate it you can that or you know while making money five ways and the top of the income is definitely the way to beat that preaches must cash flow with any acquisition but at the freedom to do that it allows you because you're making money and building wealth and so many other ways as well\nThat it just that's probably the exactly why the than the a lifestyle that limited as is labeled exactly what it is it's about changing your lifestyle not only the freedom you don't have to crush her or the worry about being downsized or\nOr um let go and and or or your company going out of business than finding yourself fifty eight years old\nTrying to find another job that's going to pay the same amount as you were getting paid from the ... been working out for twenty five or Thirty years\nSo it it it gives you that that that sense of security that freedom to know that you can walk away and they can actually pursue something of your heart desire I Know many people that are in a job that they don't necessarily like but they can't afford to take a pay cut to something that\nThat that just has a a lower pay scale\nSo you know I tell people especially when there was just ... that are that are so many people going to college now and the left all of a a major study discipline at will bring them in a lot of money in their job\nIn their hearts desire maybe to be a teacher or a social worker or a police officer which are typically not high paid\nAnd this way here you can get power but then come through the state only call go back and you can ... who ever career avenues that you want that will may have wanted and that's what I like to see young people do\nSo that they're not tidal you collecting a job for the pay because I think that that's the only way that they're going to have a security in their future\nAnd that is so powerful you know we talk about how the effect of\nOf passive income cascades down through the generations and that was the biggest surprise to me is when it when I first began investing in real estate using what do I was teaching me as my mentor and executing exactly the way he was telling me to execute so I Would get his same results\nI was I was focused on me I was focused on my retirement and then my kids started coming to me and asking me for information and it's changed your trajectory of their lives for exactly what you're saying now they're pursuing the things they love knowing they can always create wealth and passes income to real estate\nYou are listening to the to the Dell wants the radio show with Lynn ...

you want to get started now\nGo to a lifestyle unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop dock [laughter]\n\n\n[laughter] I don't know what I'm saying\nWell come back to the do on

income and the power of passive income to allow you to create a life that\nYou can do the things you want to do you can be where you want to be with the people you want to be with waking up every morning choosing what you're going to do today it is a powerful way to live in it's a wonderful way to live I Am so appreciative of my life and the fact that I was able to\nFigure out how to do this I found a team to help me I found a mentor do ... to help me\nAnd I did when I was told to do and I was able to create the same kind of results and that's that's really the power of mentoring and an education and mentoring program which is what do these created and a lawyer you and I are both products of that program and now we have an opportunity to pass that map back and\nSo let's talk about we were we were talking about you know investing where you live you know just looking at the things around you does it make sense to invest in this market\nAnd if you could invest in the market right around you it's a market that you know well it's a market that you live and you have connections and you can put a team together and you can invest in that market\nBut if it's in markets like California or some of the east coast states or maybe it is a state where\nThey're passing unfavorable landlord laws where they've lost sight of the fact that landlords are are not all billionaires and um that we actually do have to pay the bills we have to pay the mortgage for that property we have to pay the insurance we have to pay the upkeep on that property in order to do so there are costs involved\nAnd that the rent has to cover those costs and that's been forgotten in some states\nSo if we're in one of the states and we need to look elsewhere can you give us some some tips on how to get started as best investing a far so that we can continue to live in the places that we love or maybe even move you know if we're going to retire we might move\nAnd then one to invest in a variety of other places so how do we actually make that happen\nWell the first thing that you would want to do it any market is perform your due diligence of the area\nSo not only are we doing due diligence of actual properties once we find them we want to look look at the area we'd like to watch will look at crime statistics\nWe'd like to pull up the city of the website to see it there any non ... owner occupied laws or restrictions or rules that we need to adhere to\nAnd so we find that area that looks good and then we're going to start searching for property and you mentioned earlier that real estate investing really is a team effort\nSo many times I hear people say that they want to quit their job and become a real estate investor as their job and I tell them that's not what you do and then they go out there as a lone wolf and try to find properties and make the of some sort of an entrepreneurial a business\nI keep your day job yet I'm ... or\nFollow the plan and establish a team that when you think about your team after you're doing due diligence and you find an area that looks good you're not afraid to drive to the area should do you ever decide to go buy the property for instance I've invested in Houston which is\nA four hour drive from the Dallas area where I live and I have invested in property their sight unseen but that's a large metropolitan area and so I'm not necessarily familiar with each\nPocket and each area that uh that I Would want to actually have Kennan than an an old property and you have to do your due diligence on the city in the area of the city with the methods that I had just a just mentioned\nThat once you've decided on an area that he'll also want to\nEstablish a a a team of people who could actually funneling find property or you whether that be a team of a local realtor is in the area it might even be a\nConnecting up with an on line with some of the real estate investing groups that are in the area and you want to be able to put offered so that they can run the numbers on each skilled at that TV to see if it makes sense\nBut that's not enough just to find the property and do that you've got to be prepared to take action once you do find a good deal because if the deal it's going to go pretty quick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "18"}
