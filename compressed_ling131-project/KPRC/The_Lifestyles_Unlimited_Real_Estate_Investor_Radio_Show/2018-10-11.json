January entered a peek at twenty eight Seventy two and the next test a potential support hundred a moving average which hasn't been broken in six months so we're going to see was taking place there so most stock sectors are deeply and the red\nEven today defensive consumer staples stocks and utilities are attractive now because of being the safe haven place for money again as we've been laying out the case that is where you want to be in the later business later part of the business cycle\nAnd there appears little doubt that the recent upside break out in Bonn you'll just causing investors to rethink their applications to risk your parts of the stock market\nThis has been a bit of a fit because of the increasing the spike in yields interest rates and I think that's what you're seeing and maybe even to the overall stock market itself what's going on with their earnings and we in fact been and be gardening season\nSo you know it's a it's not necessarily nothing to beat everyone surprised to see what's going on in the recent volatility it's sometimes normal so far I Will say this is reasonable it's normal shouldn't have surprised you not a time to panic\nBut it is the effects of some of the withdrawal of liquidity by the Federal Reserve removing its ... a easy it's stupid to monetary policy\nAnd you're going to see the end of this year beginning of January the European Central bank is ... and sort of scripted out to do the same thing also reducing liquidity in the market and you're seeing some of the other is beginning to do that as well February so\nA withdrawal of liquidity is stimulus from central banks which has been such an important driver for risk your asset classes like stocks in real estate a but when they begin to withdraw by liquidity is we kind of call that now quantitative tightening it shouldn't surprise you to see it fundamental change in the markets\n[noise] justice sometimes moves very slowly does HSBC Holdings will pay seven hundred and sixty five million dollars to settle Justice Department claims that it will fully covered up risks associated with residential mortgage products in the run up the last housing market downturn\nWell twelve years to figure this out and get it settled between two thousand five and two thousand seven the bank place defected mortgages into residential mortgage backed securities they created and sold and um basically HSBC has agreed to pay the penalty\nBut does not acknowledge guilt yeah that's not uncommon for banks affect a look\nThe financial institutions large banks are very important parts of the of the economy no doubt about it and I don't certainly want to be in a position of feel like I'm demonizing banks they need to do well\nBecause they're doing well and they generally the economy does well and vice versa that's good\nUh they're very important to our economy no doubt about the more regulations and things some they certainly need regulations you can't let them just go crazy but we've seen the effects of that but I think it's even some of the regulations steer them and have unintended consequences\nAnd look if you go back prior to the crisis even um you know central banks provide liquidity to a certain extent some low interest rate environment manipulating interest rates making money cheap to go out and make these loans\nOr if the markets setting it they can decide the risk is not going to be perfect but I don't think it helps us early in the I think the fed sometimes makes the problem worse in some instances than they help\nAnd uh you know banks have to take responsibility but banks it's not only limited what's gone on and what took place ... years ago and the financial crisis\nHow many times now do you still see banks in the headlines whether it be J. P. Morgan or Wells Fargo I mean it's ... and people to create accounts out of nothing uh I think incentivizing you do sales and Reagan staff rank and file staff to\nBasically you know a ... get fees that were really unnecessarily um charge to clients or they do they define does any I don't know anybody that's good you know what\nThis is the latest headline from Wells Fargo I mean they've been doing it how are you say a dozen of them all the time they're in some kind of trouble with\nWho I never heard by saying you know I'm just taking my money out of Wells Fargo to pay a fine or less than ... that's their policy\nIt's almost like um you know it gets buried in the third page of the wall Street Journal most of us are too busy we're not looking at this latest fine that's been by HSBC is your reporting now or J. P. Morgan Chase or Wells Fargo and the other big banks\nAnd so they just uh they just pay their find only knowledge of the guilt move on down the road\nKind of like a kid child you got to think of the consequences\nAre they really that uh the big and by the way then they were supposed to be you know they were so too big to fail and how much bigger are they now that they were even at the time of the financial crisis so I don't necessarily think all this regulation would it be Dodd Frank or other things that have necessarily helped us\nAll that much um was your baking activities but as you said banks they have to succeed yeah well\nUnless you are now on the socialist side of things where you say we should we just make them stayed on property [noise]\nWhich we know now it's become a little bit more mainstream that have that way of thinking live within it did at one time it's hard to believe but it is true [noise]\nHead to the website this week we're talking about what goes up must come down and great technical commentary you've been listening to the FTA money out\nThere saving listening for entertainment purposes and you can\nAnd you can make money when you\nIf no guarantee a teacher and I think that Michelle should be considered an offer for somebody to fish in it by force found any security if you have an identity that have asked me in a town of ... and sit down face to face and child shot in LA do you follow\nThe SPA money now and it's a program\nThat I Am the aim of\nYou have more than I Want to copy about poverty and complete it came on the website\nAt ... dot com that after a while and dot com or color Mr angry at ... contract that he may wind paint him have [noise]\nWell let's just anyone can get away with this I mean the Brady fax me Kanye West during an Oval Office meeting hugging the president\nThis guy let me get this guy [laughter]\nThe things that you hear from people that have caused that changed or the desire for change to happen\nWell you know and I think you actually just hit the nail on the head when you explain explained how change happens and it's going to happen\nWith regardless of whether we'll compared for it or not and I also think you hit the nail on the head talking about how we have a core beliefs and core values that are instilled in us from the very early age and we grow up with these\nParadigms this thought process of we must do this this this as a life where it's just a checklist and we're just checking things all the time goes on\nSo I think that that's the big thing that a lot of people hit that moment and I think the most common one is that when we get members to come in and there has done all of those things they followed the checklist they did all the things they were supposed to do in other words they adulthood well according to society you know they went to ...\nThey had a job they work nine to five and they saved and they saved and they saved and luckily a lotta times I don't have to hear stories about of traumatic thing that happened they lost their job or they're scared of losing their job or a ... a divorce or\nSomething to that effect usually it's just a stark realization that they're starting to look at what they have set aside and the life that they want to live and that you are not going to be\nCohesive together it becomes a situation where you know we work hard and we put all of our money into savings and\nYou realize that you're not going to be able to retire and you feel loved you feel cheated you feel like\nYou have gone through life and you did everything you were supposed to do and you're not going to help rewarding retirement that you thought you were going to so I think that's probably the most common reason why people decide that something needs to change is more so in their spending habits\nUm that they want to continue to live their lifestyle as if they're still getting a nine to five paycheck every single month\nAnd like it's at the retirement accounts and whatnot just aren't going to be able to cut it anymore\nSo I think that that's the big reason why a lot of people feel that a change needs to occur and they're willing to step out of their comfort zone and they're willing to say hey you know what\nI wasn't raised but I Need to acquire a whole bunch of rental properties in order to pad my portfolio is but I can have a decent retirement I think that they realize that that is what they want to do and honestly that's what they deserved to do they earned about money the right way and they\nSaved for it so now they want the money that they work so hard for it to work for them I'm\nI'm a rare occasion I Do get numbers that come in and they had lost their job and they're in a situation where they're saying you know what I never want to feel so helpless again I'm never wants to be at the mercy of a business owner of being able to tell me\nThere's no way that you can come into work day we're downsizing and suddenly you feel once again Rob do you feel like you've been cheated that you've been taken advantage of and in reality you know you put in a lot of time and effort into the company that you worked for in your ...\nYour expendable so once again they come into my office when they want to have a conversation about how they can never be expendable how they can be their own boss how they can be the masters of their own destiny and that is empowering and\nHonestly I think that the one thing that holds true and people that have not never invested in real estate and the thing that holds true in\nSeason to investors is you know we liked the idea of having dot control and we definitely want to not be nothing is going to determine\nWhat our outcome is going to be except for our own choices that that's the one thing that you have to change you have to be comfortable with change so that you can create a lifestyle that it change happens you're prepared for it\nAnd that that can be the first step that we help people with and that's really what I Want to talk about today it's it's harnessing that fear of change in order to drive success instead of allowing yourself to sink back into old habits to sink into depression with that\nThat feeling in your gut that you know what you're doing isn't going to work if you have a question especially one for ... since we have the pleasure of having her on the show with us today\nGive us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven were happy to talk about anything having to do with life or real estate\nThat you want to talk about\nThat decision to do something different\nIs challenging our our brains don't don't like new in New information ended the older we are you know that that old adage as you know old dogs can't learn new tricks we know that's not true most of us have had an old dog that we've been able to teach something new to a very literal sense\nAnd many of us have learned new things later in life and and I'm a good I've got a good ten Fifteen maybe Twenty years on you I think I could be your mom Jillian um but you know I I learn new things every day\nAnd when people come to us and they made the change in their\nRoutine to include us in it\nThey have sought out education and mentoring for real estate they have\nCome and participated in the program they put themselves with a new group of people they're already beginning to make very significant changes\nAnd they're doing this with our minds that resist that change so in a moment when we come back I Want to talk about that change and how we support that change and harnessed that change to drive success and not let ourselves get derailed\nBecause changes something people are afraid of ... I've heard people say that people are just as afraid of changes they are speaking in public and so we want to make sure that we give people the tools they need to drive success from that fear you're listening to the ... radio show this is Lynn ... infidel today if you have a question called\nEight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven and moment Chilean and I will be right back\nTo the ones we know what what we're supposed to\nLimit it ain't real\nEstate investor education when torn group that has been taking people by the hand and teaching them how\nTo invest in the ... the only an hour or so we'll go to the local and national invest more will will you be real magazine made us back\nTo and we won't be able to\nShop dot com where you are planning a judge will\nMyself on limited gives you enough to retirement my dog is your name was scanning and land on the battlefield really he returned action\nFree online wow how to get the property among the primary evaluation you need to identify the very beginning the dot com sign up to\nGetting the best meal dot com\n\nBust and we would be your money five ways cash flow of money in your pocket\nMoney equity capture the bounds of dollars when you have the Bible white property using the white men appreciation we with the increase in Bellevue overtime\nFive years ago ... we found in my home I don't know what you mean you know one of our National Marine mammal radio show one one on one of them I'm going to be more shopping", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "11"}
