{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "And he'll tell you this is you need to start that sooner than later and if somebody's start in late\nWhen you start you got to have about a five year time frame to implement that and that's not easy and I think to your point in the book you're saying with the minute the minute you start your business you need to start talking about what is the end in mind looked like and so you have a whole chapter dedicated\nTo that yeah I think a lot of times with the small business owners we we tend to get it started companies it's almost like you're building a fulltime job rather than a business\nAnd that's really going to hurt you in the long run because you can't sell yourself with a business up you're basing your business on a unique skill or talent or your personal brand is going to be really hard to walk away from that 'cause nobody's gonna buy you they want to buy the company but there's ways to get around that you can create systems processes and these are the kind of things that build a lot of value to a company\nWe also look for recurring business model positive cash flow business model where people are paying you ahead of the services are always a great business model\nAnd you've got to understand whenever there's only one percent of companies that actually get purchased sort of meet people who have actually sold the company\nIs really rare to find that experience and the reason is that there's not Ninety nine percent of companies that were for sale it's just that only one percent were worth something to a buyer so that's a really hard truth there really accept\nBut with the right strategy in mind and a lot of planning you can actually build that company and have a nice exit plan and that's where you're going to make the most income most likely\nWell that's a great pivot because I guess me back to um you know kind of the question we have not been talking about that is what is what did you do you did say your business talk to us about your business and and what it was a\nSo in two thousand one or a car friend of mine up in Chicago we started a an automotive community\nAnd it was based around the general motors high performance vehicles Corvette Camaro Firebird at that time and this thing just took off and we're we're making a revenue basically for advertising money so we are competing directly against magazines in print ads but we're delivering a far more value because we had over a hundred thousand people visiting our website per day\nSo blows magazine circulation out of the water but we also had a lot less ad rates rather than get a lot more value a lot more scale ability\nAnd when we sold the site and two thousand seven at that time much my partner and I were both making about two hundred thousand dollars each extra as profit that our side business so they're actually we worked full time doing this in our entire careers I've had a oiled career at basically over twenty five years he had a professional recruiting agency in Chicago\nSo we all did all these things is basically our side business and that's where it kind of grew\nBut we had an exit plan we got bought out by a larger online organization that wanted to go into that space in by all these automotive forums and communities and we sold that website for two point three million cash well congratulations and they can really also point out the date of your exit\nTwo thousand seven or even um you know again\nThat was that's that's that's a great accept us two thousand eight was it would have been a terrible time yeah folds your business or tried to sell your business to talk about talk about hedging the value there and getting out before the market crash cars that they uh the home bust happened in two thousand eight or nine as you guys know so we actually got out right in time timing is everything\nYes it is well so this isn't your blood I mean this is something that I think once you do it you become successful you're gonna have failures as you pointed out so you know I Would tell anybody that's going to get into this don't expect to be successful immediately iffy half failures and you'd like in in this in your mind set to keep pushing through but what's next for Tony\nWell I've been doing more business consulting addict I started about a year ago with three sixty five driven a spin off from one of my things and\nI've been to a small business consulting for about the last ten years more privately and I decided to be more vocal so I started to take the public speaking things 'cause I knew I had a story in this book was going to be that store to get it out there and I wanted to get more clients to be able to help them get off\nYou know have these ideas but let's turn these into an ... action list and create your first business so that's why I'm kind of working with\nPeople to create their first business are busy professionals who have all those excuses that we covered earlier to help them as a business coach get through ... through that and said help them set goals and keep them on track I'm very good at keeping people accountable\nI started a Facebook group called three sixty five driven success an entrepreneur mastermind is free\nWe started that in January and there is over sixteen hundred people now have you guys are searching on Facebook\nLook up the group three sixty five driven I'll join in and we have a lot of discussion is a good mentor in group where we have a lot of successful entrepreneurs in there and a lot of sparring ones also so it's kind of a good mix they ask questions or get instant feedback it's a very supportive group so if I wanted to find a side hustle business today and I'm starting to trying to figure out what that is\nThis group can kind of helped me kinda brainstorm that kind of walk through the process of what you lay out in your book and so again you avoid a lot of the mistakes in the pitfalls\nAnd it goes back to I mean you know when you started your business you didn't have these type of resources you weren't able to tap into you know the rest of the world out there but it's beautiful today you can do that and that would even say for branding marketing I mean there's so many differences today was social media that you didn't want to have ... thoughts on that\nHow do you incorporate all so much if you don't know how do you incorporate all this and to your side hustle business well I think largely social media can be\nUnproductive and deconstructed there's a lot of negativity out there but if you start joined them these Facebook groups where they have a lot more people with like minded enough good mine said you're going to surround yourself with a lot better people who are supportive\nBut you got to be able to get your brand out their personal branding a big thing you want to start a company people needed not\nYou don't it's not who you know it's if they know you you got to be on the tip of the talk of the first person they think of when someone ... wants a referral for some kind of a service or product and you get better by that by just being more social use social media socially engaged with people ask questions get people talking so they see your face\nAnd that's how you start to build that personal branding that's going to deliver the marketing value and it's it's free guys right now the number one marketing that's not used and it's free is live video so if you're doing Instagram or Facebook and you're not doing live videos you're missing out on a huge huge opportunity to get yourself in front of thousands of people at zero cost\nYou did a live video I think twice when we came in here and as for that is pretty cool and you are right\nI mean a lot it's a long time ago this stuff costs so much money to employ now it's free it's at your fingertips and I think to your point you don't see people utilize that enough\nOr so it is amazing well you know I guess that's why having a group like this at three six five driven a group can help you\nAnd I would hopefully encourage people you know get out there try to start a side has a business man you know I think your your vision was don't start off with a million dollars is a cyber start off in at least with reasonable goals right\nAnd then work your way up words yeah sometimes people use that as an excuse they they have this dream business maybe they want to own a race track or an exotic car dealership and they've got to have these millions and billions of dollars investment\nSo I don't believe in that I think that's a lame excuses not start you gotta start sometimes a smaller businesses\nBuild those up enough to enough value sell those and kind of call them like a stepping stone and to build enough of those and you're going to get to that dream business in the event and at the end well I'm looking forward to having another interview I Want to see what you're doing next a side hustle to\nCome out to the next the next ah the next step and of course uh you know get by your Facebook as well and if anyone's interested I think that's going to be a good a group for them\nWell Tony thank you so much for

Tate how stupid it an educated about the topic they are\nHow you get to be in Fox News or CNBC or an NBC or any of these stations CNN and become a fact reporter when you don't even know the facts\nThat what you're getting to be I'm going to cover the facts are today but what irritates me is that these guys get on T. V. spewing the lives and then his representations so that the electorate ends up with a median\nSavings account a five thousand dollars and an average savings account to Ninety five thousand dollars this is just ridiculous let's start out this article says there's seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate let's just take them one at a time by the way the idiot the wrote this articles\nSean leg Oh yes and this is from marketwatch the articles out of marketwatch Sean if you're out\nThere listening please please come on the radio with me let me take your at all and show you how embarrassed you be to talk about stuff you know nothing about I Will bring facts figures people's deals financial whatever you need if you think you could stand up to you were one tenth of the ... what you're saying I don't think you just end up any myself\nSo let's talk about liquidity\nHe using the number one reason the stocks are better than real estate because stocks are liquid if you want to get out you can get out All right let's explain to you\nThis is a misrepresentation\nThe reason you can get out of stocks is two reasons one there's a liquid market for it there that's granted but to you have to get out at the price they're willing to let you out at\nIn other words if the stock market you bought a stock or a hundred dollars a share and it went down to Seventy five dollars a share yes you could get out immediately at Seventy five dollars a share\nBut that's not what you're saying what you're saying a real estate is I bought this piece of real estate for a hundred thousand dollars now it's worth four hundred thousand and it took me thirty days he said forty five days to sell it\nOf course it took forty five days we're looking for a greater fool didn't pay four hundred thousand for something you paid a hundred thousand for you're going to wait until that person comes around but\nWhat if the offer that piece of real estate that appraised for four hundred thousand for three hundred thousand\nThat piece of real estate would sell overnight instantly I you can cash it out in a second I Do it all the time and a seminar I say if you could buy this apartment this way cash flowing this much who would buy it today\nNinety percent of the people in the room raised their hands they would buy today that's how quickly I can sell a piece of real estate when you're not trying to rip off the person you're trying to sell it to\nIf you had a fixed market where whatever the appraisal was the property itself or you could sell real estate just as quickly as you could sell stocks but that's not what's happening people are trying to make massive capital gains are real estate\nOn the stock market you're happy to take whatever it is they're willing to give you the day you want to sell it is that liquidity\nIs that really liquidity\nWow let's say that you lose half of everything your word\nMan you did it was such a liquidity [noise] that's so important isn't it I think if you think about what I'm saying you realize that they're not comparing apples to apples oranges Georgia's they're comparing somebody is letting their stocks go for a non premium price\nAnd that's why they sell so quickly real estate if it were sold for a non premium price would sell instantly also I proved it many many times\nIt happens that some apartments don't even make the ... don't even make the market for even a day or two in fact in houses the same thing if you had ten red houses we can sell ... houses for your lesson a week\nThat's held liquid real estate is compared to stocks\nIt's as liquid if not more liquid because number one would you buy stocks yo nothing but a piece of paper and hoping to prayer they're going to go up but when you buy real estate\nYou were getting cash flow the second you buy it so just like you want a bond or a CD for one percent or two percent right now exciting see these two percent you buy a piece of real estate deterrence ten right out of the blacks is way\nMore exciting especially when you realize his taxes which is a short break we'll be right back if you don't want the radio show\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the Joe ...

[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWell come back you know here's some more wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire Americans one month he\nLooked back to do on the radio show today I'm dismantling an article written by somebody who knows nothing about what he's talking about the article is seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate and some Sean ... or something like that I don't know guys marketwatch\nArticle and um somebody sent it to me and I don't know who's shown here so you know picking on some guy I don't even know but the bottom line is if you read his material you can tell he doesn't know what we do at all he has no idea at all and he has no idea how to be rich if he's rich is because uh you can't be rich justify he's saying\nTells me he can't be rich there's no way to be rich\nI mean he's talking about things it's such an ignorant matter all he could do is make money saved money make money saved money because you're not making any money invested in the way he said this thing up his mind\nThe next reason he says number six reason is because real estate or stocks are safe for the real estate when the market starts to go down and you can get out of stocks easier that's absolutely alive here's the way I Want you to see it I Want you to vision this\nI Want you to vision that you're standing there\nOwning stocks and the guy's got a gun to your head and he says\nThe stock market's going to go down today three hundred five hundred points you're at work can you get out\nThe answer is no you're not going to be to get out the middle but three or four or five hundred point drop it takes to take the gun and shoots a bullet at you and you're dead you can't get out of the way of something that moves that quickly the stock market moves very rapidly now let's take real estate\nLet's say somebody says okay interest rates are starting to go up\nThat means there's going to be some point where the cost of real estate with the interest rates involved is going to not allow the price of real estate to go up anymore um if\nThey start tightening up the lending requirements are they let the lender requirements get too loose and people started to fall into loans over a long period of time you can see that there's going to be the loosening of the market to where it becomes um state for a bubble people pay way too much real estate I Want you to think about that as being a train tracks\nAnd the guy standing there with you go and look at trains coming\nAnd it's going to run you down that's there's no doubt about it it's going to run you down and you know it's not I'm just a step off the tracks\nYou can hear that train and come in and you can see that trade to come in\nAnd when we had the real estate drop in two thousand two thousand I the only people often you money with the people that didn't know what they're doing they paid way too much for the stuff they bought there were speculative buyers and the market to buy and flip type stuff that's what they were doing they're stuck with this stuff\nIt was people who lost their jobs couldn't pay the payments on the real estate they bought which they shouldn't have bought because they couldn't afford to pay it you know if you can't afford to pay for your real estate\nAh and I'm Talking about what you live in\nEven if you don't have a job for six months to a year then you've got too expensive a piece of real estate you're living in and you know so these people they they they lost this money over a ... year period of time because of ignorant decisions were they didn't listen for the train coming down the tracks\nDuring that very time when everybody else was losing money we were making a killing\nProbably the most profitable two years I ever had in my entire life was two thousand nine two thousand and I'm just on colleague gosh great investing and everybody else to say well oh my God real estate is taking this all down no it took you down\nRight so think about that would you rather have a gun to your head as a threat or a train down the tracks is a threat I Would suggest the train is what I'll take every day that thing a wake up tomorrow and having by noon to stocks go down five hundred points I Can't live that way\nUh you know I'm too old I could have a heart attack and that kind of stuff that I don't know how you keep from when you wake up one day and forty percent of your wealth was gone every person bring on the radio that you listen to the story is always the same why did you come to real estate\nBecause it's safer because I lost forty percent of my net worth in stocks\nThis guy is so wrong his argument is so upside down and silly you wonder how he even gets published\nMaybe he pays to publish his stuff I don't know whatever and number seven fewer taxes and fees are you out of your mind have you totally lost it does this guy even bother to do any research before he writes something Sean Sean\nCome on Sean investors when done correctly don't pay any taxes on their income you pay taxes on everything you do every single transaction that you make money and\nYou're paying taxes on how the heck and you say there's less taxes if he's oh there's a because there's property taxes they don't have property taxes you don't need property taxes because you don't own anything you own a piece of paper", "show_name": "The Lifestyles
