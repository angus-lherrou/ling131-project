longevity means we could be living longer so living longer and being broke is not a fun thing to think about so um I think there's a lot of\nThings that you can do to help at least prepare for that I'm One of them out kind of say is you know looking at your housing situation I mean you know our house that we have while we're working while we had children can be a probably a little bit bigger is going to have some of the bells and whistles\nI'm putting you know we kind of become empty nesters and we are dynamic starts to change and we're moving to the point at some point maybe we're going to retire we don't have that income coming in from\nYou know from working I'm looking for cheaper housing and so you you know for many people the biggest trick is you know looking or if you leave a big city like Houston or a big city you know even worse it's like New York if you look at a San Francisco the cost of housing\nIs extremely expensive and of course in a big city we know the restaurants the groceries all of that's got the mark up because of of of the surrounding cities so\nThings get cheaper when you move further out in the metropolitan center so it could be kind of an example here in Seattle\nYou know three bedroom home it cost a million dollars um this is according to Zillow a if you go nearby devolve Washington you get a you know basically that house\nPlus a nice yard for half a million or or less even renting a in Seattle and three thirty five hundred you can move to suburbs for basically two thousand so um that's about Fifteen thousand plus an anal savings um but you know what looking up on housing costs in any major city in the suburbs and I think you'll see a trend that got to go to California\nI'm gonna see the same thing there but a round rock or to basically the Austin okay Garden City uh to Manhattan so all these different things but I thought this was kind of a cool statistic\nA million dollars and retirement fund and how long it lasts in the city so if you have a million dollars and you retire in Manhattan\nIs going to last you ten point five years okay so you can have a nice town Manhattan just make sure you're not gonna live past ten or San Francisco is nearly as bad as twelve point seven years\nBut it's sort of the big cities you could see that bugs stretches even further in Denver I was just there as a matter of fact a one million to a last Twenty one years okay so now we're getting we're double digits from uh Manhattan West coasters may also try Phoenix where a million dollars can last over twenty five years now\nWell if you prefer southern living here the good state is Texas a million dollars can last year roughly twenty three years in an Atlanta but in San Antonio Texas twenty seven years so it kind of nice to know a million dollars a here in Texas is gonna last year more and I can promise you this my dad um he moved from Houston\nTo Luskin and I said Luskin but\nReally Luskin looks like a major Manhattan compare to brought us you fly through the town I brought us and don't know you went through it and I can only imagine a million dollars in that town would puffy last I think a hundred years but um yeah he can Zeke grows his own stuff and I mean Everytime I go there and being handed\nA jars of canned peaches peas and come back and store all the stuff that I can tell you this I Know exactly where I'm going if there's ever a fallout going to my dad's and brought us and he lives on the lake the fish and he's got every canned good it'll last for about a hundred years of food\nUm but you know it's saving ... and not avoiding a you know trying to avoid running out of money that is that housing is a big component to look at your situation\nThese discussions we have all the time to downsize and discussion um entertainment expenses again while you're working you're eating out more you're traveling more you know those things and that's why when you have a budget separating a discretionary non discretionary expenses can really help\nOr you'll be surprised how many people\nAh don't have a budget I see ... are you finding brought us on the map here\nAnd looking for a short flight it's ... yeah this this is about to stop lights uh I see let's see maybe a flash and yet oh that's a I see a sixteen city blocks if you can call\n[laughter] yeah yeah exactly and residential and you see the key a lot of country roads without I came from who smoked and now he he does he went out there to get away from everything to weigh about ... but you know as long as he's happy that's what that's what counts and then I think the other thing is just you know rethinking your old budget um\nI Know many people kind of rely on a you know old budgets\nMaybe a budget while you're working um you know you got to redo things you gotta just always the exercise of adjusting you're spending your current lifestyle and you know it's the biggest fear I see people get towards retirement\nYou know that fear of running out of the ability to create that make that paycheck you know you've been doing that for so many so many years you don't really look to rely on your assets to produce that um but you know starting to have that as exercises and plan for that change because psychologically it is a tough one\nDon't let it sneak up on you and I see that happen many times people retire they don't kind of anticipating so planning your spinning out of the first few years of retirement is critical\nAnd I called to retirement blues I mean I think a lot of times people have they over travel excess hobbies\nThey they fix everything in the house it's like why do you have to fix everything you don't have to get a new kitchen new bathroom but they feel like they got to do something and that leads to over spending that is one of the biggest problems and I don't care I've seen for the most disciplined I'm an engineer with a spreadsheet I've seen them over spin it in all the spreadsheet did nothing because you didn't follow it\nBut you know planning those steps and\nYou don't need to do it all at once retirement is hopefully going to be longer term and enjoy it you know take these projects on finding hobbies find things to do is even ... even more critical uh you know kind of finding that emotional side of what you're going to do is is a big point of a retirement\nI'm getting a taste of right now and I kind of a precursor to it\nBeing a recent empty nesters yeah how's that transition gone it's weird man it's a weird feeling um house seems the dynamic is obviously changed considerably sure you know and this past weekend\nAll I did was watch football Saturday and Sunday new ambition to do anything ... sounds like a good deal well\nI didn't get anything done that's the problem um some thinking that's just phase one I'm I'm Still you know ways off retirement\nBut uh I Hope that I don't lose the ambition to want to you know [laughter]\nIt was pretty nice sitting around watching football weekend it'd be nice but others got done I didn't I Know I feel guilty today but I I Can't imagine you know living in a retirement community that wasn't active for a you know a neighborhood that wasn't I don't know man\nVisited one of my clients or I went to see to Colorado I'm One still lives in the city so there's plenty to do um the other one she lives in silverthorn to Colorado on a lake in a beautiful as can be we walked outside and I had to withdraw felt bad for talking while\nJust to secluded from me there by the website yesterday well ... thank you for listening to the SEA money are [noise]\nEven listening to it for entertainment purposes and you know\nFinancial markets came off and you can make money when there's no guarantee a teacher and I think that on this show\nShould be considered an offer worse than what the decision by forced out any security and to have an identity about me any channels and sit down face to face and child shot in LA do you\nThe money out of the program\nBy SPA\nYou have more than one copy of all kind of hard for me just remind the website\nAt ... dot com that after a while dot com or ... contract he ... he can have [noise]\n[noise]\nIn a synagogue ... appears in court I mean the Brady Fox is the first appearance for Robert Bauer is who just got out of the hospital this morning\nOur thoughts and prayers continues to be with victims' families and with the community and rescue sure we have a team of prosecutors working hard to ensure the justice is done U.S attorneys\nThat were stealing your money taking your money away from you and investigate in things they made money let's talk about stockbrokers supposed to talk about real estate syndicator supposed to talk about financial planners these guys all talk you into giving you their money\nI see all these guys as people were big gigantic white T da da da da da da da da da da da Silva they've got the cars that got the planes these are the most egregious self centered\nMoral sales people but I've ever met\nThey are all about taking your money and putting it on their side of the line that's what they're all about and when I came out of that when I woke up to that as a twenty nine year old kid I said I can lose my own money\nAnd I'm not going to let these guys get rich off of losing my money for me I can at least lose my own\nBut what I found out when I got out there in the real estate investment world was is it these returns that these people are offering guys are ridiculous you've got to understand\nIs when someone tells you they can give you one to two percent of the savings account three percent on a bond\nIf someone tells you in a real estate solicitation guy on the Internet the other bragging that his deals going to earn three to four percent\nNow by the way he wasn't indicating that was good or in three to four percent of the deal he didn't even talk about how much of that he was going to take out by the time he took his\nOut his fees and his overrides you may only be earning two to three percent but he was bragging about that why would anybody invested that you can go out to buy single family houses and earn ten to twenty five percent cash flow from day one\nOr within a month if you have to rehab to house ten to twenty five percent not only that you are lab reached the point where you put twenty percent down you can increase the value that house by twenty percent easily and make a hundred percent gain on your money within one year\nNow interestingly enough I found out you could do the same thing with small deals going to buy yourself a small apartment complex [noise]\nHe put ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand dollars down you operate that correctly for one year using the tools that we teach you lifestyles unlimited and you're going to be able to double\nOr I'm Sorry we call the ten twenty five one hundred percent rule you can increase the rat by ten percent or the income by ten percent\nBy either increasing the incumbent Laurent expenses which will raise the value of property by twenty five percent\nSet your only invested it twenty five percent that twenty five percent increases a hundred percent return on your investment we called up to ten twenty five one hundred percent rule very simple to accomplish\nNow why would you want to go into syndication for some guy so often you get three to four percent and then bragging that well if you stay with this deal for ten years you know it's got to go up in value hell maybe it does maybe it doesn't act I should say maybe it does maybe it does it but the reality is\nIs that you don't know\nYou don't know what's going to happen ten Twenty years from now\nAll you really knows you're earning three or four percent modest whatever the guys these are this is nowhere\nNear as good\nAs what you could get by owning your own real estate deal not even close right so you want to understand at first I was teaching people how to do their own real estate deals\nAnd get massive massive bad if it's another massive benefit is the ...\nDone correctly you can earn enough depreciation to one cover all the income you're earning from your real estate investment and too many times have excess depreciation law says that you can carry over to your earned income if you are an investor\nBut if you're not an investor if you're a passive person putting money in syndication you cannot carry those washes over to your own earn income so you're losing that whole\nPart of the investment world\nNot even close so these guys are taking your money from you whether it be the stock market to financial planner this indicators they're putting it into deals that they're getting paid fees and commissions right up front\nMost of the indicators out there that I run into the people I see on the Internet the once if you go look up what they're really doing it read the prospect this was a pro forma\nAnd see what their offers are you will find out there taking fees up front these during the middle and fees on the back in some of them take a acquisition these some of them take a construction theory at the some of them are taking advantage would be a property management be at a liquidation the\nBy the time they're done with the fees you're ready to return is sub par to say the least sub par compared to what you should be able to earn it a real estate transaction\nRight so I was teaching people how to own their own deals\nAnd or partner and when we partner were equal partners\nWe both get to ask a syndicator to be equal partner with you asked them to put in as much money into the deal is you do and they will laugh at you they don't put it in their own me money they use everybody else's money\nThey keep\nTheir money make profits put the money in the bank live like a king and use everybody else's money to get rich the same as stockbrokers famous financial planners and the same as you agree just indicators\nAnd quite frankly irritated to ... out to be hit irritated\nMe so much I started lifestyles are limited to be able to teach people how to become wealthy on the road without some are sick in the end of the pack it will take a short break be right back to to do on the radio\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio you know we'll be back with more like the principles of\nLifestyles unlimited AK ... real estate

equity capture the thousands of dollars you create when you have a righty invite all white property using them right Matt appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime\nEquity buildup ranchers down your mortgage each month and finally the tax advantage when done correctly real estate investor said no taxes\nOn our cash flow and capital gains lifestyles unlimited these are the five ways we make money in real estate which is why real estate accounts for more millionaires in the world today than any other investment vehicle you should have some real estate in your portfolio to learn how to attend a lifestyles unlimited free workshop\nCalled eight six six Ninety seven one eighty nine Seventy four guilty lifestyles unlimited workshops dot com\nAnd you put in somebody who can operate the property and the property does it you know go to death I mean think about it if you if you\nIf you try to get a management company to come in there on a deal you only got paid a profit no management company could do that they want to get paid a fee so now we're in the world peace now we're in the world of people getting paid for sure\nTo do this now you can take people that are not entrepreneurial but just what a job want to get aid\nTo come in and do the job come and it'd be a syndicator I called them lead busters lifestyles that's not a real world out there in the real world but I called them the guy that puts the whole thing together I called the lead investor that's my verbiage has nothing to do with the real world most people out there called syndicate right\nSo what happens is is that these guys started coming in and now they were getting paid now they could afford\nTo quit their job and do this is a fulltime job will that solved quite a bit of a problem because now you got their full attention on the deal\nBut some people still work good enough some people didn't have the skill sets necessary to do this and like I said the better the salesman you are usually the worst you are at being an operator\nIt just because you're so greedy think about everybody that sells I always laugh and brings sales back down to the lowest common denominator for salespeople and by the way I've been a sales person my whole life but think about it if you ever meet a girl that works in a dance is a dancer\nAnd she gets paid by the look by the touch by the night she walks out of there are five hundred dollars tax free every night you're not going to get her to get a regular job\nYou get a bartender they get paid five hundred bucks a night tips you're not going to get that person to ever take a regular job these people to get paid on commissions and especially big commissions it instantly and over and over and over again\nThey're not going to ever care about business operations success or profit that stuff\nMeans nothing new guys all they care about is the next deal the next transaction and the next set of teasing commission sticking her that's what's going on out there in the Internet right now with the indicators around their\nFees fees these fees and the\nNon profit Robin Robin we're right back with\nYou [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the radio show

man on a mission to retire America One for each\nWell the ... radio show today I'm Talking about how to do syndication the correct way not the way you seen advertised out there and the Internet on marketing and so and so forth [noise]\nNot the type of agree just um types of investments where they take your money they make massive millions of dollars for themselves and very little small returns for you\nThis is not the way these things should be done I see it out there all over the place and I see it on the Internet I see everybody out there right now they're looking for and doing everything they can contact wise to get your attention so that you will follow them so that they can get you as a customer to invest into their deals\nAnd the reality is it's just not the right thing to do and I'm going to I'm just going through I've already done this for twenty eight years now guys\nAnd I've I've done been doing this before any and all these guys ever existed out there in the real estate world I guarantee you bring me anybody that's claiming to have been around longer than I have and that will show you that it's not true\nSo the bottom line is is that when we came through this educational programs lifestyles limit is a mentor and educational program\nWe're we're teaching people to do what I did which was my real estate but again like I said in the last segment people started wanting to partner together\nBut partnership and very quickly turned into syndication and now the difference between the partnership for the syndication is\nA partnership is everybody's equal partners everybody puts up money everybody gets their share everybody has some say in what goes on a syndication is where one or more groups of people get together and they raise capital to do deals they take money up front they take money in the middle of that money at the end many times\nAh and they just take agree just fees out of the deal and almost every case\nSo we started running into these problems on the list of some of the things that we started seeing happening here lifestyles when people started doing this number one ah people were getting hurt\nThey're getting into deals that were dying because people didn't know how to operate the deals\nThe people that were doing the deals were either number one just completely unsophisticated an educator and how to manage the property once they close it's very simple raise capital and close the deal they'll let any of these guys tell you that they are the smartest thing in the world that they are like the sharpest played in the drawer they're not\nRaising money in syndication it's so simple you take one or two classes on syndication you go to the bank or get yourself pre qualified you it's a simple stuff to do guys it really is we teach we'd been teaching it for twenty eight years now it's not hard to do what is hard to do is to do it correctly\nTo where you are preventing\nThe problems that these people are running into where you are giving your investors the safest possible investment out there so we ran into the people who are uneducated unsophisticated didn't know what they're doing and then we ran into the bad actors the greedy people that want to take\nAdvantage of everybody so let's talk about this we have started seeing people doing bad deals we started seeing unfair splits\nTo where the lead was just taking more and more and more get I call lead the guy putting the deal together truly that the master syndicator unfair splits where the the syndicate it was just stealing all the money out of the deal bad operations the the syndicator could not operate the property and they were going down people were losing their money\nI'm\nBad financing I saw people with that didn't have the ability to get good financing they were going out there and getting bad financial because they had bad credit or bad equity bad network so on and so forth so they got bad financing\nThe wrong kind of financing they didn't understand the financing and the financing at all kinds of problems attached to it\nAh it example that would be the financing was too much you overlap bridge the finance was not enough there was not enough leverage the financing had a term limitation other words you had to get out of it very short of ballooned out that you couldn't figure out a way to get out of a turnaround\nFinancing to higher interest rates\nAre the finance and get no way to get out of it there was no way to to exit strategy the property all these things were about stuff that these guys did know\nRight then you go on and you have bad promoted or\nPeople that were illegally promoting deals you know these indications are actually controlled by or they're\nLegally supposed to be watched by the SEC there are specific rules and regulations for doing this for raising capital and one of those", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day":
