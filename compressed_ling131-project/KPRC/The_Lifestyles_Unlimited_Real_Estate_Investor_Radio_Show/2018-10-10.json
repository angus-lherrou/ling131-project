{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "But an ape severely adverse scenario the IMF says of the capital could flood out of the countries that it pays not seen since two thousand they global financial crisis I don't think this is as a you know unlikely is a ... may say depends on what's happening around the ... throughout the world\nBut the international monetary funds managing director Christine Lagarde warnings speech last week the pressure on emerging markets quote could lead to market corrections sharp exchange rate movements and further weakening of capital flows\nAnd so we see emerging markets stability took on a renewed focus this week as we see them down a down pretty sharply this week in fact Pakistan became the latest controversy a bailout from the international Monetary Fund hoping that the fund will give it enough to shore up its government finances no chance that's not happening there's not enough money in the world\nUh in order for them to the to shore up the country's finance is not just them but I mean all the other countries that are in a deep issues of ... or ... or ... or\nYou know areas needing bailout earlier this year was the Argentina is not a bailout from its currency plan and we saw a few months ago we're saving fifty billion dollar bailout Argentina's\nCurrency declined further and the nation got an even larger IMF but bailout\nAgain to my earlier point there's not enough money these countries are irresponsible a relative to their their preschool scenarios\nAnd they're not doing what they need to be doing a it's not necessarily easy to make some of these decisions and they're never politically convenient but there are necessary and so with with with the politicians and I think these these countries all along themselves to become for this physically\n... fiscal messes I Will say\nThen you have an International Monetary fund is willing to sort of big brother if you will come in and rescue them and they'll sometimes put a few uh conditions attached to that money usually either one they don't provide provide some conditions and number two um they're never really expected to pay that back\n... and ... that the country never really makes the change is necessary that needs to make so they just get bailed out again and this is another example it took place in Argentina\nTurkey has also faced a mass of currency drop while all three countries of the ones who lost mentioned vastly different situations are crisis Sherry very common element and the flip side of a strength thing dollar has been a weakening of their currencies we see capital has flooded out of their economies in the United states\nAgain the differences if you have all this liquidity around the world\nPrinted by central banks wanting some place to go\nIt's going to look at it emerging markets and look at the issues there is going to look I developed international it's going to look in places like United States and we see currency issues we see the Federal Reserve\nNot only the printing printing enough money and lowered interest rates okay but they have also now raising interest rates and strengthen US Economy\nRaises the value of the dollar relative to other currencies this provides a headwind to the many of these other ah\nCountries especially when they have a lot of dollar denominated debt\nSo there are many implications of this but I keep trying to boil it down to very common theme of central banks and if you want to see you know examples in history of the booms and the bust cycles strictly over the last fifty years\nYou have the central banks in this case the Federal Reserve stumped parents all over them\nIt's not that hard to figure out in fact so we seek capital has flooded out of these economies and into the United states and its enticed in part because the Federal Reserve's campaign of rising interest rates and so recently we've seen over the years that emerging markets are retracted significant blows of investment we saw that last year\nAnd we were overweight emerging markets but we've seen the technical breakdown the macro environment breakdown changing US dollar and central bank policy all of that has allowed us to want to change our position\nAnd providing a boost their economies in these cases these countries um and as asset prices rise of business or more funds to hire and expand and the case of the international Monetary Fund their severe scenario\nOr you know I think there is a riskier it may beyond just sort of what we call a tale risk I think these risks are are real doesn't mean we'll have a global financial crisis it just means that the risks and these emerging markets\nOr or maybe a little um\nYou know more problem a more probability associated with more downside with them the other than that otherwise and see the estimated al flows under the scenario that was talking about much higher than they thought\nAnd or in the fourth quarter of two thousand eleven by the way as an example of the uh at the height of the European sovereign debt crisis we also saw these examples\nBut the the scenario is not inevitable Boulder berries are certainly high in the IMF some measure of government desk just debt distress and part of a function of overall borrowing and debt and leverage that is rising not getting better\nDebt is getting worse not better in other words and there were forty five percent of low income countries where at high risk of debt distress or already experienced that the IMF said compared with only twenty five percent five years ago\nForty five percent of these low income countries have debt issues and risks risks that distress versus twenty five percent five years ago\nThis which serve as a wake up call and just another example of how it is coming back to leverage\nAnd much of this has burned by the things what central banks have done they've got now for Seventeen and a half trillion dollars in the balance sheets of the central banks around the world that is a lot of money\nAnd they provide these liquidity it's going to find places to go and when it was posted to go and then it pulls out there becomes do see the boom and then you see the bus what do you think of crossing the guards\nJob performance [noise]\nUm I think it's fair I suppose you know she's a she's a she's so Europeans the French woman she's going to come from a she's kind of the cloth of being a more of a\nYou know I probably certainly a Western European more regulated more socialistic type government\nUh and that's what they advocate for they don't always love us policies or they don't certainly have an America First type of a you know stance they see you know they want global cooperation they want to be a greater greater influence on global affairs particularly on the economic front\nOr they want to throw the money of taxpayers which is where the money from the international vary from comes to when they law that's where it comes from when you see the money that goes to Argentina and turkey I mean these are the bailouts and they happen again and again\nMuch of that comes to the American taxpayer\nA bunch of that comes to their member countries but they're doing that and just sort of try to help deal with many of these issues related to you know the economic dynamics of many of these countries and tried to help them\nBut it doesn't really seem to help all that much so you know I think if the context of the ability for the IMF to really do anything\nI suppose she's fair\nWith the IMF really does at the end that really benefits the world\nI don't see it really changes all that much it's a big band aid [noise] big bureaucratic band aid and we're seeing that play out in real time time for a wakeup call him the website sta wealth dot com register for six weeks newsletter you've been listening to the SPA\nMoney out even listening to it for entertainment purposes and you can smell\nAnd the money when you pass

Florida Panhandle just shy of a category five Fox is Evan brown tracking it live from Miami\nAbout the fact that there's really nothing out there there really is that it's all really just a giant scam that people that are lucky enough to be at the top will stay at the top and everybody else would be at the bottom and no matter what you do society is going to take you out because you just never going to make it [noise]\nThe other aspect is that most people believe\nThat what they're doing is investing what they're doing is planning for the future and I would've debunked that thought process and teach you that what you're really doing is you're just getting up and going to work every day\nThat's it simply you're getting up and going to work every day and you're doing the repetitive things that fall into the character\nOf being that person that gets up and goes to work every day there's no difference even when you think you're you're straying out that aside hey I'm investing in a four one K. all you're really doing putting your money where your company want you to put it you're not really doing anything different you're giving them your money letting them mess with your money so that you can't use your money\nTo go get rich wealthy or just financially free for that matter just be able to have enough income that if you didn't have a job where they wouldn't have the noose around her neck\nThat you'd be okay but people aren't doing that they won't do that the majority of people won't do that and today\nI've got one of the status emails that I've heard in a long time and I love these please send me all your said emails like because there's something to be learned through somebody else's\nPain because the pain that they're going through is the psychological insanity of trying to do the same thing over and over again and having a continued to fail and yet they don't see that they're doing the same thing over and over again this email\nRepresents that to the TV it's a perfect example I'm not going to use the gentleman's name a because it\nIt's such a sad tale and it does\nImplore you to think about the way you see the world\nBecause it's really it's ... right it really is someone to read this email as painful this please hang with me because there's a lot to learn through the end of the male is although there is something we're into the middle will kind of just take the male part as we go and then finished with the conclusion of what it really means\nIt says hello Dell has been a while since I sent you an email this emails not to be discouraging although it is very discouraging right but he he's saying it's not to be discouraging but just wanted to get your input about something that had been thinking about for a while now\nOver Twenty years ago when I was sixteen years old which makes him thirty six today and working full time while in high school I didn't have a lot of money and back then\nHad a car without a stereo around the time most cars didn't have a scale or if they did it was really bad sounding one so before the Internet was around I went to the library and check out a few books and read them\nAll to learn how to install my own stereo since I couldn't afford to pay someone else to do it\nAll right so here's the first paragraph first story [noise] he's proud and by the way I'm not putting the guy down but he's proud of himself because he was smart enough to go to the library and figure out how to put a stereo when\nHe saved himself the money putting the stereo in right and so that was a windfall to him that he could save a few bucks to put the stereo in himself and he put all of his times effort is energy into learning how to do a job how to do labor\nWith out do labor all of that reading did what for him did absolutely nothing it didn't increases life quality lifestyle standard lifestyle anything nothing unless he did work all he did was becoming more educated labor\nIn life next paragraph once I figured out I show my friends what I'd done and they were impressed and ask for bike install new stereos amplifiers CD changed says or their car as well before I knew it I had a business license and ordered car stereo equipment at very low prices compared to a high retail cost\nThat stores like Circuit City and Best Buy were selling them for\nDue to my good work and great prices I had a ton of cars lined up in my driveway waiting to be worked on\nI made good money until years later factories began including nice sterile units in cars Carl electronics became so complex that you had to unplug your computer and remove nearly the whole dashboard to upgrade the stereo so I saw the beginning of the problems early on and got out of the business\nSo let's talk about what this guy's saying in no time at all I had a business my friends I Want to defined business for you\nIn a manner that you've never really thought it through if you have a job do you own a business thinking about it if you have a job do you own a business and the answer is no you own a job\nThere is no business Bob L. L. C. Steve L. L. C. gym or Judy El Al ... is not a business\nIt is a job the only difference is you own the job you're not working for someone else but you still are working for a living I think about that 'cause I'm gonna come back to that later in the next second when I show you the proof of all this to American culture I'm working for a living\nNine to five right [noise] [noise] then he goes on and says All right so they beat me out\nThey started putting good stereos and in this business went away and I could see the light so I got out of that business well he wasn't in that business\nHe was in that job he goes on fast forward age Twenty one the Internet is still new so I went to the library and got a bunch of books on how to create a website\nMy sight became popular and a few years later when as CEO search engine optimization was unheard of\nI learned how to make my Web pages very friendly to Google so a lot of my key words were listed number one which brought in tons of traffic and revenue to my Web sites I thought I hit the jackpot since I Would make thousands of dollars just from Google alone\nNow let's think about this what is he doing again he's working he's producing websites and he's keeping them search engine optimized and is he getting rich from that is that creating a long term financial retirement for him know\nWhat's happening is he's got a job\nAnd he's making thousands of dollars in his mind thousands of dollars is a lot of money\nI may be a Twenty one it is right\nThen it goes on and says that was until the word caught on and millions of people learn how to make their sites S. E. O. friendly as well so my key words that were ranked number one got pushed down the page ten thousand since so many people were educated about this work\nI then figured in order to be successful I have to learn something really complex that it's in high demand and maybe that I can have a stable\nCareer there it is he's got to learn something else to give him a career never has he invested\nIn an asset yet none and you got to ask yourself a secondary question\nIf he was so good at a seal optimization why is he went from one to ten thousand I pay a guy right around the corner like a very small amount of money and he has he owes me right up to page one now how could this guy consider\nWell because he's going and taking the short cut way the cheap wage reading some books and actually thinks he's a hero that's like guys who read a book on real estate investing think the real estate investor\nAnd they think you have the business because they have one right now but they don't know how to do it they're not doing it correctly and eventually they're going to get wiped out because they don't know what they're doing because all they really wanted was another job\nFor everyone to hear now delivers the daily Dallas then and liberating unconventional ways than twenty four hours a day now on the radio dot com [noise]\nYou wondering free workshop is for we'd been amazingly successful with\nPeople who have pressed for time doctors lawyers\nSmall business owners and national reining in light of your way to ... and don't realize that they can start creating passive income today within the confines of their schedules and commitment you want to get started now got a lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that lifestyle unlimited workshop dot com [noise]\nRadio [noise]\n\nLove him back so here's some more conventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version at a\nMonth\n[noise] [noise] so today we've been discussing why most people don't become successful and that is because they really believe in the back of their heart that back in their mind and there are that workers the secret to becoming wealthy that if you have the right job you get the right education you have the right job\nYou're going to get rich when none of that is true and it some people it takes them till they're thirty to figure that out and have their midlife crisis some it's forty some it's fifty\nSome it's one job two jobs three jobs before they finally figure it out but when you tell them there's a way to go out there and make millions they can't\nBelieve that you could actually mean that because in their mind they live with the type of mentality that's called a lack mentality they believe in the zero sum game of this world the way the Democrats believe Democrats believe that for a sector of our society to have more money they have to steal it\nFrom another sector now think about that what is taxation there's nothing fair about taxation a man or woman goes out and producers\nAnd should they lose what they produce will just take a poor guy should I come take a pork rupture crop uh sharecroppers farm away from him or shake his income away from it you wouldn't think of taking and come away from a poor parts of why would you think you're taking in come away from a rich person or a middle class person for that matter\nWhat is it at our society\nThat makes fifty one percent of the people out there believe that you have to steal from another man to put money in your pocket and that whole society politically believes that that old society morale\nMore moral Lee believes that right and then they wonder why they're broke now the other end of the world the other opposite end is that people have the abundance mentality and the abundance mentality says I Believe there's enough for all of us and I'm just going to go ahead and produce a lot\nAnd then the more I produce the more the risk for every body yeah and even when you tax me I'm Still going to try to produce even though I don't think it's fair I still believe in abundance I Believe in production\nAnd that's what's gonna happen now the Trump has been elected in you're going to see it as the world's going to believe in abundance again and the country's going to prosper right and you're going to see middle class and rich people get rich again and you see the people that have the lack mentality remain poor\nAnd they're never going to be anything but poor because of the way they see the world how you see the world is the problem is I ... on Stein said\nIt's not what is the problem is how you see the problem\nThat is the real problem and if these lack mentality people would ever get out of their lack mentality and get out and get some abundance mentality they could change their own lives but they won't let me read the rest of\nThe email it says I Am sure if you are not teaching real estate and kept this info to your inner circle of friends and family there would be amazing deals for you just sitting and waiting for you to snatch them up says no one would be aware of what\nThey're passing up you say that real estate pies big enough for everyone but it's not the whole world is confident and educated enough to spot great deals\nNo it's not if everybody can spot the great deals what he's saying no you're absolutely wrong\nFirst of all the deals that we do it lifestyles many of them could not have been done most of them could not have been done if they weren't done his partnerships\nSo if it wasn't for a group of people being educated like mindedly\nTo where they all understand the investment in a business they're not working in the business is not a job they're investing in a business is an ongoing concern\nThat has a product it's pretty hard to al date itself because think about it for just a second whether they're going to invent a way for us to vaporize ourselves to go to bed at night and sleep\nWe have to have a place to lay out head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera so until they have vaporize Asian we have housing that when the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then housing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer okay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't steal all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals\nNow the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals now here's a ... I've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years and we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done a map before so that part is why", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "10"}
