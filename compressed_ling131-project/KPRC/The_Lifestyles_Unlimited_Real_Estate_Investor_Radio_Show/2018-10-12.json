I Know I yeah I used to ignore it well let's turn this conversation back to a store just as somebody go Astros and start go Astros a\nLook this year we're going to see an increase for Social Security recipients to point eight percent for Social Security increase announced this week good news\nFor those also they say it's good news for the value retailers a big lots dollar tree Dollar General uh I could see where that's a it's kind of a rationale for that the hike is the biggest since two thousand twelve\nThe core customer for a Dollar General family dollars in annual household income of thirty five thousand dollars or less\nThe marginal ... propensity consume for low income families is a hundred percent\nSo therefore they're going to get some Social Security benefits are going to get an increase and they should find its way and their way to these value retail stores are so we see dollar tree or has it outperform writing an dollar price targeted by Raymond James big lots has also rated outperform\nForty dollar price target Dollar General also a very nice price target gain for that\nBy the way up to a point seven percent for the year year to date not bad the archery also ... the sock has fallen twenty four percent so um\nThey're bend down but may not be a may not be all that bad going forward that might\nBe an area where you might see some opportunity dollar generals a clever marketing name for a store\nYeah because you can not everything's a dollar there is something that is more or less and then they can say well it's generally a dollar for Dollar General it's what it means\nThat is true I mean it's not a dollar right there are some things that are considerably more yeah dollar tree I think is actually a dollar so everything in the dollar tree is a dollar and some of my shop there yeah\nIt's it's a place is always packed I've been a Dollar General I think the only thing I've ever been to dollar tree I mean I think that's a brick and mortar that will have some you know how some legs compared to everything else like you've never had to do much and\nI'm going to say well where I was I was in New Braunfels and I needed one of those things I was going to go in the inner tubes and I need a plastic Jessie ended up yeah that's something to put my wallet does he got ...\nGetting wet and so it was the dollar general had it so it was not at all or by the way it's like oh use like a sandwich bag a you know you can go to academy and get a national thing that holds your wallet your cell phone and pay like thirty bucks there is not academy that I could find that it was the only store as I could go and I'm just saying you do the right thing right now it's basically the same thing to have a Gucci\nLoser Todd Todd water for they don't make light of the river ...\nAll the way all these names were dropping or not sponsors thrown around a full disclosure why are they my personal sponsors his first wife and his\nHis a motif is no guy for leaving but high for for girls it's it's a look at OK Dollar General um I I Would not have I Would have bet money you are not\nFrequenting what's your wedding day for ... you did go I enter you or I have been seen\nAnd I did I did have to go one time to a Dollar General when I had no other options and my Gucci one was a water\nOkay\nI've got a question for you or what is happening oil in the last few days dropped about four and a half bucks\nBut it's still a bit of a global growth obviously story I mean it's um you know you see photos happening China was a big consumer of oil a you know supply store is not all that different but\nYou know it's not it was down a little bit I mean it's not a big you know you're going to see the ball 'til the it's a commodity communist evolve to leave her at a commodity like oil so it can be trading activity\nIt could be a lots of things that are factor but I think also this week we've seen News International Monetary Fund about little bit of a global slowdown a slowing global GDP Growth from what was three point nine the three point seven\nSomething like that and so even on a you know two hundred twenty basis points of like that it it sort of makes the debt if you will a global perspective is really a direction everything that so much to the level it's coming down with the fact that this coming down at all I just I think it might affect the expectations for a demand for the commodity\nI heard on the news of the day but there is in the U.S\nUm [noise] what's the big one the a bucking\nThe oil spill yo you know two hundred years worth of oil there alone for the U.S and they were not not not for little consumption\nYeah so I'm ... years for the United states who are you ... you know right yeah it's amazing it's it's truly the technology is what's made all that possible a which is again goes back to capitalism and entrepreneur is trip and\nUh you know it's it's lots of things but really ultimately comes down to the technology that can help get oil like that and ... and gas out of the other ground\nAnd allows the ... so then you know the policies are are the policies don't allow people to get back in ... out of the ground at all will utilize that resource than I think this administration is more business friendly but we're also talking about uh uh now I\nAnd again\nWith no real plan in mind I I got some ... uh software for track design started designing track and I built the tables and started putting the stuff together and then I realized that I had about four or five different kinds of trains are not really even understood that there were low quality\nMedium quality high quality and super high quality trains [noise]\nWhat's interesting some of them didn't even fit together they didn't look right together that's for sure because the you know the the toy stuff and some would just plain toys like oil trains then there were you know quality basic low in trains then there were\nModel trains that were scaled in there were super scale um trains that were just so unbelievable they're very expensive too [noise] and so I figured out at that point I needed to go into ...\nNinety percent of the stuff I had back\nWhile they're selling stuff back that didn't make any sense I kept buying more stuff that did make sense in the garage full of stuff\n[laughter] I still have no track\nThinking of this this is bugging the bejesus out of the guys I'm sitting on how many people's lives are that way they've got all this stuff in their life\nBut they've got NO PLAN so when I ran\nInto the limitations and this is what happens when you don't plan and you just accumulate and you just go whatever it is you do or doing will eventually run into a limitation will stop you dead and ...\nAnd I ran into some limitations that just flat stopped me dead in my tracks or at least let me put it this way I knew that if I continued from that point for the I was going to fall into something\nInto a problem that would stop me and my track so there was no need in my mind to continue because I could already see the flaw in my plan\nAnd so I just stopped doing\nThat thing how many people are sitting there going ... I think I'm just going to get some money would get a four O. one K. andme again IRA and all of a sudden they got all this stuff these cars in this debt in this house these kids and stuff and you go man\nThis plan isn't working whatever plan I think I had to go into college I did it\nBut it had a flaw at the end the college there's no real plan past that and it's going to fail and it is failing or broke I'm In bad ... bad credit\nOr even if I'm not broken have bad credit\nI'm putting money into a four one K. this paying me nothing I'm paying off houses paying me nothing of putting money and I raised paying me nothing nothing doing anything for me in my life financially but I'm going through these motions he's blind sickening repetitive motions that are getting me nowhere\nAnd so I just quit you just give up and you do what I did I focused on something else all of a sudden you know you you'd say oh I'm going to get a hobby emitted you did something that\nI'm going to focus somewhere else because I Know I Can't be rich I just can't be rich because I don't know how to be rich the stuff that I've done I thought would make me rich didn't make me rich and so you just give up so I gave up\nAbout ... a couple of months ago three or four or five months ago though\nI'd sold off so many apartment complexes that I had so much money I just you know what\nI'm going to go to the best trained design company in the country and they're already met bending them I'd already met them but they wanted some really expensive is really expensive to get them to build your transit in fact this company built Warren Buffett strain set for him build his lay out\nWhen he bought be in the south so Warren Buffett bought being a south Burlington Northern Santa Fe and\nHe had to build this a lay out for him that replicate it'd be in the south\nAnd so I went to them and I went to their their office in Dallas and met with the people that are real nice people would come up with a little bit of resigned I showed him without really had the actually drove down to my house in Houston and looked at design already had and we're going to put together a plan build this thing and then when I got the price back oh my God I could buy three houses with that\n[laughter] I could buy myself two or three cars with that I could buy a house that I could probably use that for a down payment an apartment complex so that's just not worth it they have set a toy trains\nYou know and so I put it off again\nHow many times did you look into how many times did you go to ... miles rather grand counties Robert ... Donald Trump or lifestyles unlimited or wherever you went\nAnd then you just put it off\nAnd\nResearch study get excited about it and then you dropped the ball and walk away I see that happening all the time people come to my son has been here I was five years ago down is after they warm up to you and we'd been together for a couple of days spending time together you know you don't\nAnd bring about a year or two years ago you don't remember as you're five years ago you don't remember measure ten years ago and then they're ready to re reiterate to me that at that point\nSomething in their life was changing a divorce a job sick family member or something and they just had NO PLAN to get past that and so they dropped everything else and just\nBecame a wandering generality like that term\nI didn't make that up I heard that somewhere wandering generality\nYou have no specific reason to be alive\nYou're just wandering around being generally the same person as everybody else a wandering generality\n[noise] and I remembered that feel that same way\nSo I decided to go back and see this company and tell them I'm going to finish this project\nYou bet I I'm going to finish this project I'm not going to be a laundry generality I Am going to complete the project started five six years ago and be something the short break be right back to the ones we show\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the ... radio show will be back with more like the principles of justice\nLifestyles unlimited in the real\nEstate investor education in mentoring group that has been taking people by the hand and teaching them how to invest in real estate twenty eight years our students have been so successful like creating wealth and half of income that they have one local state and national invest Rubio more well the last well\nDo you think real magazine named them back in the U.S [noise] if you're ready to and really the only\nLifestyle unlimited workshop dot com access ... schedule\nAt lifestyles unlimited we know that investing in real estate\nCan put you on the fast track to retirement\nBut you know the difference between feeling\nLifestyles just suddenly will help you figure it out within seconds of entering a possibly ... from anywhere across the country you'll see estimates for property values rental race cash on cash return\nCheck out the free online class at getting the best deals dot dot dot com you\nKnow that every dollar you invest in real estate makes you money five ways cash flow of money in your pocket each month equity capture the thousands of dollars you create when you have the right team and by the white property using the right man appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime\nI Want to be somebody I like the people out there that are wealthy they're nice they're likeable that care about other people I'd like to be J.

mission to retire America One version at a monthly fee\nGoing back to do on the radio show today we're talking about why do we not have a plan and our life why is it we we run around and spend our entire lives\nJust taken while shots at stuff we're in the long term plan\nAnd I'm using this example of me trying to do this this railroad are seen as an example of what most people's lives are like there's NO PLAN in place when we ever sit down when we were younger and go who do I want to be who am I modeling\nYou know I think some young kids do that and they go I'm going to be a rock star I'm going to be an athlete and they modeled those people and that's probably what they ended up being then because they bottled that\nBut we're working with an issue here where it says you can't be everything you could have anything but you can't have everything you've got to pick what you want there's a limited amount of resources in your life to be able to get things done and to build a life like I'm trying to build a railroad bottle\nYou have to follow some steps but the first step is figuring out exactly what it is you're trying to build what kind of life are you trying to build you know things like where do you want to live when I was younger\nI decided that I wanted to go find my fortune somewhere and I lived in Madison, Wisconsin I Know there's no way of making a fortune Madison, Wisconsin there's nothing going on here this is the liberal bastion world of the whole world I mean there's nothing but school college and government so the entire city ran on call schools college in government\nSo I knew there was no chance there from what I Do is find a place to live I actually got into research and found out the five fastest growing cities in the country\nThinking this was a this is where the opportunities going to be this where we're going to be to get rich is being and one of the five fastest growing cities in the country and I literally made a list of them and I decided I was gonna go see all\nNow interestingly enough I only got through three of them before I get stranded here in Houston ran out of money I never I got out to California to see LA or San Diego or San Francisco which were also fast growing cities but I ... I ...\nAnd out of money here in Houston made my life here but at least I was in one of the five and it worked out I made my fortune but I picked to where I was going to live in today you know all of a sudden my you know my fiance Lewis is always ask me why don't we go buy a house here by house here go here lived there have there\nAnd it's just it doesn't make any sense\nYou know you you pick a place and you build your life there and so many people have never lived left the neighborhood they live and I used to live in burgers or if you know where that's in spite St Louis and that's where all the riots were a year ago and I just look at those people and I think oh Leigh\nI'm so happy my parents just moved I mean it's all you have to do is move if you were living in a life of quiet desperation or in that case a life of loud desperation\nJust pick a better place to live\nYou know it's like it's insane where do I want to live is a major question your life and most people just they were they're born\nNever venture up or or maybe go with their job dropped them and they just stay there next when what do you want to look like\nDo you think do you got up one day and go you know I really want to be a three hundred pounds if that person I really think that'd be right and then I also think I Want to smoke cigarettes have yellow teeth I think that'd be something I'd like to look like also yeah and I wonder where outdated clothes don't fit\nBecause I'm too fat or at a movie out of style at all times definitely out of style um what else about what it looked like I Want to have a weird haircut\nI Know what I Want to do I'm going to stick holes in my face and put pins in them I'm going to put ... nails through my nose and I'm going to put on gold on my teeth and I'm In a\nPure myself from head to toe with wait a minute\nThat wouldn't look as good as it would if I had that and tattoos I'm of the cat to my body or something that can never fix the rest of my life I'm going to look like this stupid tat to\n[noise] do people actually sit down and think that stuff up\nHow do you decide who you want to look like what you want to look like right\nIt's a choice it really is in every way shape and form it's a choice after seeing those six year old guys up there\nI I came home and said you know a Dell a few less meals a week\nA few more exercise programs a week and you're going to look like a sixty year old body builder as it might as well do it it's worth it to be that that a couple of hours a week more than what I'm doing right now because I'm doing some now but a couple of hours a week more eat a little bit less drink a little bit less and boom", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "12"}
