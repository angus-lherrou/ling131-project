I've tried to pay down the house and tried to stay out of debt you know I'm trying to keep up my job get a little better do a little more get paid a little more my job all these things is is your plan but the plan is working\nAnd my problem with my home was it every year we would have a freeze the only one or two days maybe for the most were the temperatures drop below twenty degrees and for every hour\nThat you're below twenty degrees temperature\nOne quarter of your plants tropical plants die\nSo by the time if it stays under twenty degrees for four to eight hours a whole night their debt they all die and so every year as replacing all these players along with all the angels are that had to be replaced every\nYear because we planning the gardens these ... because they're they come in and stay through the heat in the suburbs and those guys who die off we had to put it in other words can handle the heat but when it got to be whether they would die off\nSo this is the annual thing so what did you decide was is it will change the plan for my whole\nLife changed the plan to go away from tropical and go to an English garden where I can feel it with plants that will survive the winter here and survived the heat of summer\nAnd so I drew up a whole new plan of what I wanted to put in the yard Melissa that I worked on it for hours and hours and hours and came up to a conclusion what we want and then we paid landscaping\nCome in and put the plants and so forth and get it to where we wanted to be [noise] now\nAs we did that we ran out of energy and money before all of the particular gardens and this house has like ten different lawns\nOr if you are how she got a front yard a backyard and they're both probably not that big this is ten dry law odds and that it has hundreds of bats flower beds planning beds stuff just blows my mind\nUh there's probably a at least a million dollars with the landscape materials planted in the yard right now and I go through ten twenty thirty thousand every year and I'm trying to change that get it back down to some realistic you know um so I changed the way I was going to do the plan you're going to have to change your plan\nIf you want to get financially become financially free you're going to need to change your plan now in the apartment complex overlooking yet or that we have purchased we had a plan going in the lead invested is doing the deal had a plan he can see what the other guy's plan how the other guys play it was wrong\nAnd now he has a plan that he's going to put in place but even as he puts that plan in place there's tremendous number of obstacles\nAnd so as he is going through this thing this first week the obstacles are becoming clear to him things some of which were clear before we purchase the property others that were hidden very well until after closing you find about and again it's all the due process of getting to the obstacles\nAnd I kind of wanted to work through this with you today because as a working through this yard thing I sort of figured out\nThe ... the process here and hopefully you can learn to take something from this process it put it into your process to make things better so the first thing I did was I when I looked this up oh there's a secondary problem the landscaping company that I had put in my steps of plants they did such a poor job\nUh and they tripled\nThe charge of my landscaping weekly monthly landscaping fees and so I had to let him go so I had no landscaper for about two months and just had somebody mowing the yard and so all of my bed all my plants were destroyed\nThere was nobody watching my yard and all of a sudden I woke up and it looked out there to go man my arch destroyed looks terrible\nIt's all had to take on the project or would've had to do is I had to put it into perspective something I could deal with is what I did was divided up into areas\nAnd like I said there's like ten different environments ten different areas in my yard each of these ten different areas has different plant types\nIt has different son ratios from the day or night or from you know all day long what part of it's all of a sudden full sun parts son park shade and shade\nAll those are different everyone so everyone has to be dealt with completely on its own\nYou can't just go in there to I'm going to theoretically get into your fix everything 'cause you can't so I took on the very front part of the law and first because it was almost completely dead\nAnd the beds we're just put in we're looking weak\nUm\nI had a flooded out area there were some sprinkler heads were broken there were flooding the yard\nAnd so I had one part of this zone was all\nDead because they had no water the other part of his own was flooded because it had too much water now trying to figure that without because you can't fix it by turning the zone this bleaker sprinkler heads on fixing it because if it was all dry you would just water more if it was all wet you would water less\nBut they're in the same so\nI just wanted to go out there to investigate head by head by head on the sprinkler system\nYou know what was wrong and what I found was two of the sprinkler heads were completely broken and that's why that all these two areas were completely debt because district or heads were broken\nFound on the other one the sprinkler heads were leaking and I also found by research that some of the ... way too large for the small amount of area that they read because when we did the yard\nWe had to redo some sprinkler head to head combinations problems so we come back we'll talk about how we start hacking through this stuff and how it relates to your self financial situation right back with the jobs

couple of weeks or we look at all three of these and see that these are gigantic managerial\nI'm good word for looking for the it's a of process engineering situation where we have to change the process completely route so we're talking earlier about you having the right plan financially\nYou got to get the right plan that's why you come someplace like lifestyles you get the plant or how does how does this stuff work what should I be doing what does it work what does work and then you've taken you work through all these different suggestions in your personal situation and see what's happening like\nWe're talking about income you're in a minute which is probably the most important would but the easy one is expenses what what are you wasting what is being wasted in your life and um I find myself you know looking\nAt my life in my process in my home and my business has the same way I look at what is the dead weight dead weight in my life takes up my life\nSo I was given a a thought process early on in life and my dad said um it's not what it costs to buy subjects would it cost to maintain that something so you look at your situation go\nFor where you're at financially in your life right now is it worth it for you to have that big giant home\nIs that really the right thing to be doing at this point you\nKnow maybe the kids are all gone you don't need that big home anymore why not shed that get rid of some of the expense and the maintenance both time and energy and money in maintenance of that\nBig cold you get two or three or four cars do you really need two or three or four cars I'm it's ridiculous ... I've had as many as six cars\nI'm Down to four and I'm thinking about getting rid of one of them I'd ever drive it or the other three a completely different vehicles that I actually need all three different kinds of vehicles the fourth one is a sports car I'd never drivers sports car I'm sixty two years old happily relationship\nThere's no need to go out of the town and show off the I don't need to prove that a successful business person so I don't need to have a Porsche Ferrari or\nMind as of a Mercedes F cell\n... whatever sports convertible five fifty or whatever just unbelievably fast car with a\n... you know rough comes off or actually removes itself whatever convertible convertible rough initially I show no real interest I don't even know the names and stuff in it because I don't even drive and I picked it up one time 'cause I could steal it because I had something else in trades I could care for it and it was brand new and I figured okay I might as well pick it up [noise] um\nAnd I drove it has a problem with it but just really a waste of my time uh I go out to my garage the same thing I got stuff in my garage that I never use I've had it for years uh it was a project started that never finished a project to finish the stuff left over a all that stuff she gets in your way it just slows you down\nAnd you have to take care of it you have to maintain you have to moving cleaned around and clean hundred um when\nI was going through the irrigation situation what I thought was is it I was actually wasting water I was irrigated above and beyond I figured you know the old thermostat problem you know you sit there said to the temperature you wonder well an irrigation system you don't really know what that about is and so you either see the new places to dry and turn it up\nWhere you see the places too low you turn it down I'm Sorry you you've got too much water and your turn down\nThe problem is you don't know how 'bout you turn in either direction the wise thing to do is just start out\nAnd start moving slowly but surely not crank it all the way up and get now you generally crank it all the way up to if you got to really drywall you want to make sure gets enough water tried to come back\nBut you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because once you've got it growing and saturated now you're going to get it or you turn it keep it so whether you're going to get mould and so and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act\nGuys you got to stay on top of but we are talking about this just one zone in my house so I now\nI'm working my way out of that so right so you're working your way out of okay what are we gonna do with this extra car that's extra car payment we don't need what are we going to do with the you know we've got four hundred stations a cable we only watch the same tent stations every single time\nUm you know do we really need all that are just all this stuff\nIn your life you're wasting money it's just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um\nAre you going out to eat too often it and now it's up to a little bit too much like Dave Ramsey but the bottom line is there is an expense sides of the equation now when I got back to my yard here after I had stabilize this front area", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lifestyles Unlimited Real Estate Investor Radio Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "31"}
