down with a client who basically his affective tax rates and nice little single digits him when he starts taking our MDs jumps of twenty three twenty five is pretty exponential in he's in a higher tax bracket at age eighty than he was anytime he was working so these are things to consider and got to consider in fact ...\nThese large qualified plans three or four or five million dollars in qualified plans\nPeople didn't realize at that age they become very burdened with tax obligations because of these requirement distribution they want that money and when you have a certain amount of money and you're a big four one K. and overly roll over to Iraq wow I got a million bucks for a couple of million dollars where the numbers\nBut it's not all yours a big percentage of that is going to the government's going to the U.S treasury so just keep that in mind that sort of you might want to bake that into your to your to your numbers on how you got to be taxed on that [noise]\nThe other thing I'll add to that and Mike is the the cost of health care it's going to be high on the ... of the of the level of ethics expenses for people Medicare plus supplemental insurance can cause a retired couple you know seven eight nine hundred thousand dollars a month depending on what kind of levels you're looking at it but if you're fortunate not to need much medical care of those premiums are big monthly hit\nThey'll grow each year prescription drugs can be also a very large expense and what if you aren't so fortunate so remember that Medicare or has no out of pocket limits okay so you need to understand that the other thing I'll add to this is\nUm longevity risk you know people are living longer and longer and longer in use her daughter mentioned Medicare or medicine it's provided us to live longer usually better quality of lives but if you cannot it I mean the the ... the percentage of people that are over age sixty five\nThat we're going to old we spend some time in a long term care facility is is greater and greater all the time it's a pretty big percentage of you\nWell you know just you and your spouse one of you is very lucky to spend some time in the long term care facility and those can be very expensive\nOr so just people are thinking about oh well look I'll be here by home was paid for well yes your home was paid for but what if one or both of you do need to be in a long term care facility what if that is for multiple years and what if the average cost of that if someone goes to a hundred thousand dollars a bed well it can be bad depending on what you're doing\nAnd where you are and the than the skills in the U.S or the services you may need\nSo you just got a factor these things and so I was a one just consider the cost of healthcare you need to understand those which we help people with all the time and the and the solutions for a long term care mitigating that risk longevity risk\nAnd I would say finally invested in ways that can provide a steady income stream of retirement or in many ways retirement is no different from your working years you want to have a steady flow of income and look just like planning for the tax situation like just like planning for a job at the risk of just like planning for savings and accumulation\nAnd ultimately distribution [noise]\nThis is what you want to plan for this is something you want to get

been hopefully thinking about this and you know again you they just they there are no more paychecks\nAre so but if you can get some mailbox money so to speak or some money coming in the door steady flow predictable income streams and retire with that is your way ahead of the game\nAnd all that how safe is that income stream I mean again is that going to be guaranteed is that going to be something at risk I mean the people that are taken and looking for yield me back in the days when you get seven eight percent CDs same investors to they have to go into international emerging market

more aggressive about saving sacrificing even more says they didn't sacrifice earlier or and or even postponing retirement and then how to do that so we talked to people how to do that\nBut that's why

eighty eight hundred [noise]\nAsked that or to the U.N Nikki Haley is resigning saying it's time after serving six previous years as South Carolina governor\nI'm becoming a millionaire wasn't I wasn't really all about the money but it was just about providing a for my family and possibly allowing me to retire earlier and so I I started to do a lot of research um\nStarted an online business that I had that was a selling a math resources to math teachers actually digital download so I started that back about Fifteen Years ago when uh the only things that were being downloaded that time tended to be a songs and things for MP three players\nAnd so I was actually selling\nUm math lessons in digital download form where people would get a Pdf file from me\nAnd I thought that was pretty neat because I Would create a lesson and I felt that same lesson you know maybe hundreds of times\nAnd it was just an automatic emails that went out that at all linked to a a file in it and I got to the mailbox money would come in and my inbox thing you just made a sale and it was all automated on the site and are from there I eventually started to turn my attention to real estate a little bit\nI'm One of the first things that I did was I bought a course by somebody I've heard you mentioned before Carlton sheet and uh\nIt was probably a couple of hundred dollars probably saw it on a an infomercial one night and thought you know\nI'm going to go ahead and buy this course and it was one of those no money down courses and I don't think I ever used any of the techniques that he really was talking about in the program but it really was sort of a primer for me to help me to get started and just to understand\nSome of the basics of real estate investing and um so that's sort of where I began so\nAt what age was is and where did you finally take action why what made it possible for you to go out to buy your first property\n[noise] uh I was probably I'm\nGuessing in my late twenties\nEarly thirties when I started to do some of this real estate investing research and at the time when we were doing this my mom was actually a realtor she passed away in two thousand nine\nI bet she was a realtor hadn't been involved in any rental properties herself and we saw an opportunity to get into the market by purchasing a four Plex and so we went out and um\nIt was a deal where my mom was a three quarter owner and I was a one quarter owner\nUm we put down I think Fifteen Percent back at the time on a five hundred and fifty thousand dollar property and uh\nWe each put down some money we took about thirty thousand dollars of the down payment on the line of credit and so with that partnership we we purchased four Plex which I still own today which is appreciate it quite a bit and value and that sort of how I have\nBeen successful in real estate at the beginning it was really just managing some properties and and holding them\nFor Fifteen Years in Southern California which of course with the appreciation that didn't really show that I was a great real estate investor but just that I was able to manage some property and and hold onto it for a period of time did you have any cash flow at that time or\nA when we first bought the property it was it was before unit and we pretty much had to have all four units or rent it at the time in order to make sure we're paying the bills and paying the mortgage and the cash flow is very small the cash on that building now because we've had quite a while um is is pretty good um although\nYou know when you look at Southern California real estate we have a couple of single family homes I'm One of them we just sold a last week it just closed and if you look at the value of the um in the cash flow that it's putting off it was it was not very strong and so that's one of the things that I took away from\nA lifestyles unlimited teaching was to get that equity out\nAnd start putting it to work in a place that was going to give a much better return so that's one of the reasons we fold one of our single families is to be able to read a ploy that money and get it back into a multifamily investments and investments that are going to have a much better return\nYou know that's such a true fact in California is like the epitome of that as the capital gains value goes up call just appreciation California as you appreciation goes up the value goes up\nThat's more and more jak when you when you look at the return on equity in the deal the returns get low very very low very quickly so you need to be able to pull that money out and go do something else with which is what you've been doing a very successfully let's take a look at um\nThe the concept that you and your wife got married and you had a house and she had a house there's just so typical of how people were really on purpose to get into real estate investing\nEnds up in real estate investing by just shuffling houses between family members and so forth tell us how that happened with you and the wife and you guys had all these houses back and forth between the two of you\nSo\nUh we had just bought that for unit apartment complex I'm probably the year before we got married and then I met my wife Julie and when I met her we were both just about closing on our first personal rather than if I owned a a condo and I was trading up out of that into a single family\nHome and she was purchasing a town home her town elements in Irvine um my single family homes in Costa Mesa\nAnd so we ended up getting married and we decided well we're going to only be able to live in one of these so we decided to live over in Irvine and her town home and\nUh we rent it out the place in Costa Mesa which we still have and\nWe lived there for about two years and then uh we got pregnant and we're going to have our first child and the house in Costa Mesa had a much bigger backyard and it was just a little more conducive for raising children and so we went ahead and\nYou know moved out of the vine place but instead of selling that and you know using the money on trips and fancy cars and boats and whatever we said no we're going to keep that house and we're going to transition over into the coast of south uh so we did that so I've really only the four Plex but we purchased\nMy mom and I purchased together is really the only investment property that I'd ever bought on my own the other two homes that we have um we currently live in Huntington Beach and so already act we're going to\nTake a break brought this was a perfect place to take a break

One\nBumps\nCome back to do a show with me days Martelly mark is a investor out of a California and mark is also a Southern California bastard or to get it out later right now what I Want to cover up covered here is that are way more came here for the expo\nAnd the bus tour she got to meet\nActual investors I Want to see real estate industries but that's real investors but that's too close to real estate goes or actual investors that had done multiples of deals and that gave him some insight into it's interesting a mark as I talk about this\nTo me as a reader of characters really what I Do more than anything else in life is that you a mathematician\nLook more too personal\nTouches to big big decisions in your life and those personal touches made a difference that you just said you can change your path to get into this or multifamily stuff in this past and stuff so\nAs you made that decision how did you\nUm decide which lead investors you wouldn't invest in by the way mark is now in seven passive apart multifamily apartment deals and he's been doing this uh since two thousand the beginning of two thousand Eighteen is when you started by multifamily mark\nWell February is what I came to the\nDay in a Palm Springs so I've been um a preferred member for about seven months and you've already done seven deals right\nIt's outstanding as you get into this tell us as an investor which it I asked this question of everybody this is common question which is more important to you the lead investor or the deal itself\nThey you know the horse\nHey I've heard you asked that question before um I definitely I'm going to go with uh the lead investors more important to me because ah as I've heard people say before you know at a top lead investor that really understands what they're doing can take a property that uh maybe somebody else couldn't do that much with and they can\nDo tremendous things with it um whereas somebody that's not as accomplished as a leap um might not be able to do as well\nSo I'm definitely I'm writing with the lead investor and\nI have to tell you sort of a funny story when I first came to the expo um I had asked at the two days seminar I think I even asked you at the meat allies said you know I don't mind putting down to money for this a preferred program because I think it's well worth it but am I going to be able to get in any deal and that was my fear is I'm going to put down this\nMoney and I'm not going to be able to get in the deal and so um [noise]\nYou know I came to the expo and are on the Thursday night for the bus tour a I got an email from Robert Martinez who is one of the leads that I really wanted to get in with and and I had heard him on this radio show I had heard him on the podcast and so I had heard him talk about how out of all these apartment complexes that he has\nHe has returned over a hundred percent too I think ten or eleven different groups of investors and I thought I Need to invest with him and so\nI actually got an email from him on that Thursday night when I went back up to my hotel room saying we've got a new deal coming up if you're interested please or respond to this and let us know and so I I put in my information\nAnd it asked how much I wanted to invest and I said well I Want to invest somewhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars\nAnd when he when I saw him the next day on the bus tour he came on the bus tour and he told us what his minimum investment was and\nAnd it was a hundred thousand on that kind of a deal and I said oh I just said fifty two hundred this isn't gonna be right and if I went up and talk to him and he said now it's no problem you know send me an email back and fix that up and the long and short of the story is I ended up two weeks later are getting into my first deal a maple trail with Robert Martinez\nAnd um you know I think he carved out a spot for me as a new investor which I really appreciate it and I told him as much and so that was the first deal I got into and and the second deal I also made a contact through the expo and was able to um get into my next bailed out way as well\nIt's interesting that um I think a lot of people will do the same thing a mark there's got to be difficult to get into these deals I Know that when I decided to go passive or just earlier this couple of months ago\nUm that\nOut of nowhere hired like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom is they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of\nGetting involved with it um\nSince you've started I Know there's no most of these deals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here",
