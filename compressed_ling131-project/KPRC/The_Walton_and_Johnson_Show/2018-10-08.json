I could not listen to a Mrs Ford\nI just couldn't I couldn't I couldn't listen to her couldn't\nStandard voice I knew she was a liar\nBut Mr\nI have reservations on him or he is a Bush he's from the swamp spent his whole life in Washington DC I'm afraid he's going to be more of the Justice Roberts and a a one\nCan certainly the more Roberts than Scalia\nOh yes by far by far and and that's that's my fear ...\nI understand given the background let me throw the stature though I'm looking at what a\nJudge Kavanaugh wrote two thousand eleven\nAnd a case he where he actually descended on with the district court a D.C court he said that quote it would strain logic in common sense\nThat the second amendment would allow semi automatic hand guns but not semi automatic rifles which have not traditionally been banned in common use today\nAnd dust are protected under held her\nHis point was there these assault weapons so called assault weapons bans they don't ban semi automatic handgun too says I'm Sorry that does not stand that doesn't make any sense at all and held her says anything in common you cannot be banned and so they actually talked about that during the hearings as well\nThat speaks pretty well for him from where I'm sitting\nI I just I just don't like ... Bush is it's\nA [laughter] I I don't disagree with you there because I Know ...\nI voted for both them and I voted against the\nDemocrat was I Would not have voted for either one of them had there been some a conservative choice\nI I agree I mean look here's Ronald Reagan was not a friend of gun owners\nI Would go way back there people are already knew no he did not do us any favors in better than he just happened to be better than the alternative Bush yes we're not friends to gun owners they were just better than the alternative in this case yeah he served under Bush should he worked there\nI I Am more enthusiastic perhaps and maybe a little bit less cautious than you are in this one I now understand I I don't think you get an absolute rabid you know Second Amendment person\nIn any of these folks but having said that his history of decisions is really good really strong and Second Amendment I I think we're going to be OK\nJustice Thomas [noise] it's probably in my opinion the most gun friendly adjust what do you think\nI agree completely I think you're on the money he has several times invited\nA cases to come your wish we could get some of these and then when they were turning them down he would write you know it looks like we're we're turning the second amendment into a second class a law or our men that are right and also saying that you know we're basically turned our backs on held her so Thomas has been strong\nI think you're going to find that uh the Kevin Thomas connections going to be strong as well\n\nSo we will find out I guess I mean that's that's where we are again thank you for your call and I'm I'm not saying you're wrong and I think it's good to be cautious but hey you know what we have him and ultimately as I say this is what the election was about was a bronco Obama said elections\nHave consequences yeah well you try to stuff in our face when he said that we're works back the way we the people spoke we elected Donald Trump because because we wanted the Supreme Court that's\nMuch was the primary reason a lot of them was that\nAnd there's a new company actually an old company getting into gun off that's going on here because you already like this guy [noise]\n[noise]\nAre you looking for places\nPrecious metals is a good day or so precious metals can also be a good the and last year doing the wrong way now\nIs a bad intersection I'm Chris ...

violence against black people\nIt was just like the Kavanaugh having a rapist on the Supreme Court all stuffed blown outta proportion ... individual incidents you would've thought there was always going on across the nation Mm there never has been then\nThere was no but that's the story they want you to believe and you know how a cops are called\nTo a situation either at a bus station to the airport or ...\nOn a bridge in town and they never know what they're walking and they they were told that somebody noticed a suspicious device that was a a package\nOr a backpack or something left behind maybe there's thrown out of the car on the side of the road maybe ... maybe some anthrax naturally they call the bomb squad out and everybody is you know they stopped traffic on the street and everybody gathers around and\nThey open it up and had some hope bows lunch or you know it is trash\nOr something like that can be a hobo hobo wish you the headlines the Shreveport fire department bomb squad had to respond to the cross a bridge friday night\nSomebody saw something suspicious so they closed the bridge and all the traffic had to be re routed the cops snuck up on that of ice real careful like they do 'cause they're bomb squad people they're trained and they they they snuck up on it and the e did open real slow light and guess what it was\nA bomb [laughter] they were ... and\nBecause they were expecting anything but a bomb they render that advice safe and removed it from the scene the cross legged bridge is still standing and open for traffic this morning\nTo going to

and\nTake all this stuff down there and get the registration is the old they told me at the all that well they they told you draw the line it's legal for drive a car down the road without that paper or a transition tag on it\nAnd that's not your fault it's their fault so he'd go up to the auction people\nPretty nice I gave him the or the paperwork to prove that I didn't steal this or something somewhere and he looked over the paperwork and went back as car like they do it made a\nTrack some stuff down they came back and he said I Am and go ahead and write you a warning ticket because you're going to get pulled over again and when you do just kind of show I've already been told about this\nAwful so basically you got the white man path oh yeah yeah she didn't shoot you didn't tell me who
