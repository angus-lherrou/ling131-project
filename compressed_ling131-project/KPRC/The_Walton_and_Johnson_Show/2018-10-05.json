be a good have been some we maybe coupon I could have been sitting coupons seriously don't think there was anything in it at all\nI really just wanted to get on camera was an excuse as she wanted us talking about the exchange of the ... ah because it happened on television it was a prop she had to get in the door or you know their security outside these kind of ongoing matters or the senator or senators are are quite important well she's locked in a battle\nRight now with Maxine Waters is to who's the biggest most important the noxious black woman and all of\nCongress now and and she's she's not a senator you know it really doesn't matter because of the Senate\nIs more powerful than the house anyway or is it\nI mean these are Maxine Waters in a Sheila Jackson Lee at the news all the time and they're not makes\nUnder their body as a as an entire body is water down because there's so many of them that's true there's only you know to senator what you can name anybody\nIt's like a tax is talking about squeaky wheel gets the grease it's like name somebody besides Sheila Jackson Lee\nI probably could most people can know what our representatives in Congress who I ... I couldn't be honest with you know\nOh which one of the the guys or gals up there on the Democratic side that you watched yesterday I asked questions which one of those gummy bastard a or a horrible women if you could only pick one of the ten\nWhich one would you take out if you were given the ... you know when you say take out I'm saying like from a dear lady didn't remove\nRemoved them this is what you mean I take them out of the Senate yes yes yes ah it's a tough tough decision I'm going to go with that Kamala Harris chair alright I'll let you take her and I won't\nTake Dick Durban off pretty bad I met a man was just gusting yesterday always is ... ... yeah ... that's\nNot his real name s a nickname [laughter] I think that's really the meal [laughter] okay Derrick you're tired we can help ... name is Neal whatever [laughter]\n... [noise] uh yeah he's pretty bad some craziness going on out there yeah ... pretty bad too they got admit\nNo either ... or ... that's called the burger no you can't say that on the roads yarn I guess it is though have you will have\nTo have meetings over a ... that's all right I'm ready people don't care for it I never show up for the damn meeting the savory word we often get ordered to these meetings and we just don't show up\nWhere we forgot yeah and that's all we always say oh what was that today it was was that yesterday\nAnd here's that case you missed it here's the Lindsey Graham basically singlehandedly saving the nomination if it goes through today I think it will\n... grows out of ... good closing statement as well yeah yeah he had good logic it's not unexpected from Ted Bundy was smart made sense and and spoke clearly it was unexpected for Lindsey well that\nIt was the impact it was the most journalism Ted's was more of a reasoned argument re by making an argument for the call\nStraight days of sitting with Diane Feinstein I Would say anything to get out of that this uh they found this memory that she had repressed back in her mind\nThe drug it out of her and then of course they showed it to her and she said yeah yeah that's like trip something probably happened to her and they just in imbedded in her brain that it was this\nGuy she believes it brought it up yesterday at one of these panels on these shows at this repressed memory nonsense\nIt's about Ninety percent Maloney there are no repressed memories\nThat a psychiatrist can dig added reason they have these recovered memory and that was a big deal back a couple of many years ago now not real it's not a real thing it's not it may have they're probably some rare instances that has happened but it's not a common thing that somebody can\nWell if you were to sit down and I can probably dig repressed memory of your brain that you got back there somewhere\nI don't think so I get every damn memory high\nOverhead [laughter] you don't remember them all all the time you know no not suddenly right here sitting here remembering everything that ever happened to you all through your life much\nIf somebody brings up a specific instance I can go now now that never happened I I yeah I remember that I'll go dig dug you all have to be hypnotized or a you know some mentally a minute manipulated\nBut it's it's kind of like a Google Search if you throw the word and they're all Google Search it and it'll come up or\nYou just smell something you could smell the smells I oh I remember this one day when I was ... you know wondering what do you\nHear a song songs will bring it back yeah some song will play ... or ... or memory will come back to based on that song\nGo all the questions are still linger and America is mind one of them are courses who was keeping Lindsey Graham's testicles and did they want 'em right back or are they going to let him where um for a while\nWe speculate is the John McCain death you got them all on a in a wheel and John McCain will them\nHis or John McCain has inhabited his spirit from beyond the grave and suddenly at ... threw him like a skin puppet some of the other questions\nOf course we've gone over before and after yesterday we still aren't any closer to find them out but who what when when did it happen where did it happen who else was there\nHow did she get to the party and how did she get home and let's focus on that last question for a minute according to her she rushed out of the house after just being assaulted by two boys at a party\nAnd she was afraid she was going to die she was terrified she was traumatized probably crying and that ... that you know ... tears rolling down her face\nShe didn't have a driver's license it wasn't close to her house who drove her home she should be able to testify to who it was she didn't and who ever it was should be able to testify about her emotional state\nAfter the incident happened when they got her in the car is what killed her credibility cannot tell you who it was and like you said\nI think she really believes her story she she and only she believes her story\nShe knew she fully believes it but here's the problem whoever Doug that out just kinda like dug up a part\nOf it and left the root system all and they didn't give her the background information that she needs to a flea out for the rest of us she named three people\nShe named Kavanaugh's buddy he says\nKnack up and what their new one the other part of the bad thing that really the one that really make sure that bad has her best friend in high school\nThat Leland something under the best friends goes I don't know the Kavanaugh guy and I never met him that I was a I don't remember that incident I don't remember that party I don't remember that situations\nYou've got to get the feeling from just from the statements that they said she made that she was kind of like backing off going ah\nI don't want to be anywhere near this ms forward woman anymore you know she's not right I think she likes her because their friend lifelong\nFriends and she said she said I Believe her in other words she's letting everybody know crazy mhm\nThat's what I'm saying she said I don't don't don't I don't want to get too involved with her anymore\nAnd also don't want to get drug in our private hell on television right over the world are going after this guy that I don't know it never heard of\nSo sorry I don't know how much money\nWhat we do know she got six hundred thousand dollars from go fund me I don't know how much George Soros gave her but\nShe's probably for a college professor and there wasn't really that well places probably sit in fat and sassy now for the first time in a long time money wise I'd love to talk to somebody left me a question somebody that has been in her class\nBecause she did not look intelligent enough to pass on intelligence to another human being I did hear from one kid that was an classes she was one of the worst ever got to be she was in\nSorry but she was just outright stupid about some of the things they asked her do you know what exculpatory do\nYou know the basics of psychology\nKind of a follow up kind of ruined it up and do it on his hind legs for a minute he laid out this position on his cabinet thing and a damn if he didn't do a pretty good job of a nail in this town tries to hear you say that I felt the same way though did you what are they supposed\nTo go interview everybody in Maryland in the summer of ... to\n... go every house in a certain town\nThere's nothing to be learned here\nFrom Nancy I guess\nWe're talking about appointing somebody to be in charge of the rule of law\nI'm going to adopt the rule of law ... than\nIf this were a criminal allegation you would never get out of the batter's box because you can't tell the keys\nWhere it happened and when it happened\nAnd there is no cooperation outside the accusation that sell you could sue in civil court for the same reason he could not even get a war\nSo our respectfully listen to the doctor for\nBut here's the question for me and others what is the standard [noise]\nWhat is it going to be are you really innocent\nOr guilty based on the accusation is there any presumption of innocence left in the confirmation process we have an accusation thirty five years old without any verification\nAnd I'm going to look at his entire life\nNot just this one moment in time and high school\nThat I don't know when it happened and where it happened and here's what I see from his entire life life will live and here's my understanding of this area the law\nIf you're a sexual predator if you're a serial rapist you don't just do it a couple of years ago with Harvey Weinstein's of the world\nAnd when you have the power over a woman that's when you're most likely\nWhat I have a cat and all\nThat you live the damn good life that all the women who work for you that she has our over said he was a good boss was respectfully helped me and my career was so here's what I'm saying well\nUm if if the accusation kissing not\nGod help us all around here got help us all well he's a windy bastard I'll give you that but see that's why I keep it ... I Believe her\nThat doesn't mean I don't think Kavanaugh will not be on spring court I just think you know since she's telling the truth she should've told it thirty five years ago\nYeah well that's my take you know it was a guy now that's come out and says it was me\nThere is a guy that says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted you know the the guy said her you know Kevin ... says she's mistaken\nNow she may have been assault she may really believe she was assaulted but it wasn't me it it it must be a case of mistaken a\nDay that it wasn't him it was me and then Saturday there probably me I I remember that the party and it might have been me\nAs good as the Democrats are about creating all of these fake stories they really dropped the ball of not having a man come full was an issue about sexual molestation that way\nYou you get the people that are that\nGet angry about homosexuality would also be a law they would have all these homophobia that they're telling this guy to step off the\nThat's the reason you're not a professional they realize that was a bridge too\nFar to such thing as too far with this this last accusers talking about the standing in line getting this and she kept going back more parties where they were gang raping people every week I got witnesses that she told about it and they're gonna pacify the she\nTold them about it I'll do personally wish to get this little we'll have to hear about a ... ...\nI'm afraid you're going to hear about it and because it's so ridiculous you're never going to stop hearing about it you'll be hearing about this for years\nI looked at ... got full more games and then come Monday they into the playoffs officially alright\nI just hope that they don't lose the mall 'cause then they'll get in the habit of losing going into the playoffs come\nCome these last I'll give him the weekend drew Monday Monday when I asked to get into the play offs and that's the earth and then the NBA starts to pre season around the same time and the you know fill stole so you know oh you know they ruined for the play all ... the streak and all I keep hearing about this Kevin ...\nThank you for doing my thinking for me 'cause I Want to be able to think critically and independent ...

Doug my finger in the in a sausage\nOr stuff or [noise] and she said well that was probably a stupid thing to do uh\nWhat happened to the sausage stuff are after all that he said\nShe got fire to ask course\nAbout although that was the joke is well it happened in real life in Jamestown North Dakota where men are men\nAnd sausages sausage sixty nine year old Vietnam veteran Santa pouring Ninety sixty nine and a Vietnam veteran yet because the story you're a youngster from the ... you know like the war in the sand desert storms and whatnot wouldn't have been able to do this\nHe got his left hand stuck in the sausage\nGrinder ... the real mechanical\nYeah an electric he said he was trying to clear something from the sausage grind heart and he actually he stepped on it's got a foot pedal to make it go he didn't disconnect those electricity ... and he stepped on it while I was in there and it just sucked his hand or you know into the sausage granted before he could get off of the\nButton and he had a choice he couldn't back it up\nWe couldn't get it I you know it it broke a bone but it clung to the muscle and wrapped itself around it he couldn't sit there and bleed to death in the next couple of minutes or he could reach over there and grab the butcher knife off the counter and slice of his own arm off\nWell sure enough he still with us today because he took it lifts your knife\nAnd he cut his own arm off tougher generation who's we talked about this more yeah uh I don't think you're under forties even matter less under thirty would've been able to do they would have just fainted\nI Would I screamed like a woman fainted and they would have found them hang in there with the left Armstrong and that machine and then then the authorities it'd be left to figure out what happened\nHe ... he said he wants to think the police that showed up 'cause he called nine one one right after that and the cops got their put a tourniquet on before ambulance crews could even get him to the hospital and he did live\nHe said I looked at that and I knew I was in big trouble right away [laughter] that's most of us would yeah yeah so uh instead of leading death and dying he said I went to Vietnam and handle this are at\nAnd now he puts a glove over his jump and they got a picture of him back in the shop at the house in the garage\nMaking sausage I Hope he cleaned the you know took it apart and cleared it real good first back in shop\nClass in high school we had a shot teacher for I think his name was Mr Baxter but remember\nCorrectly I Believe I had I can paid something like that old Baxter had a\nMagazine you don't remember anybody that works with you on the for this building you don't know the names of anybody other than producer Kenny and yet you remember a guy from school four hundred years ago was that Mr ...\nI don't need any of these people don't have anything to do with me seriously now these people that were not even in the same business the guy that makes the coffee\nI like that guy you know we just call him all ... okay nickname so last paper making coffee do good who saw like Dave Chappelle does so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat kind of stuff was going off when they first invented beer ball maybe one or the so that group was in the first inkling that that's the way that it first started getting really big it's spring break where they would have uh the topless\nIncidents and the crazy stuff your spring break it was a a world gone mad I guess the day comes when I get to meet him hopefully it's not you know in front of him as a judge but I Believe me in old Brett\nIs it you may have prompted me like best friends some day I'm pretty sure you don't have to worry about going before the Supreme Court now there you go into that bigger court you're probably not going to have to face about well I guess that's a compliment to my steady lifestyle I don't think he's ever you'd probably get in front of\nFew local magistrates in your day but\nProbably not the Supreme Court hopefully they listen to the wall to jobs from show will go easy on me\nOh we've got tons of judges and you know judge Ito types loved to listen to other judge each tight yeah they do they get it you know a judge most judges are hearing us judge things and their and their cargo and hell yeah damn right that's exactly right\nOh a radio or pull out you know where you ask\nThe question to uh go to their website there in this radio a radio for love or get ready to be out\nOf the day of the uh the numbers when you add them up that do you believe the judge do you believe is accuser already if they did somewhere in between I don't think there's any in between on this no but you know like Thirteen percent of America thinks there's some in between and about\nThis present sixty eight percent believe Kavanaugh and then I noticed the numbers didn't look right now added him up and the total percentage of all of the pursuit of just came to one hundred and one percent\nOf marine the three ... remember these are math instructors at colleges or radio guy\nThere's a reason to wear and radio were not flying a seven forty sevens\nFilled with hundreds of lives and we're not building tall buildings\nWere radio guy these guys didn't graduate ... most of all I wanted
