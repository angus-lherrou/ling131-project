percent mentally competent that that's a hiker who lives there and and the thing of it is believable yeah I think she actually believes the story because remember it was dug out of our mind by a psychiatrist\nAfter what six straight days of sitting with Diane Feinstein I Would say anything to get out of that\nThis uh they found this memory that she had repressed back in her mind the drug it out of her and then of course they showed it to her\nAnd she said yeah yeah that's a trip something probably happened to her and they just in imbedded in her brain that it was this guy she believes it brought it up yesterday at one of these panels on these shows at this repressed memory nonsense\nIt's about Ninety percent Maloney there are no repressed memories\nThat a psychiatrist can gauge as to why they have these recovered memories and that was a big deal back a couple of many years ago now not real it's not a real thing it's not it may have they're probably some rare instances that has happened but it's not a common thing that somebody can\nWell if you were to sit down and I can probably did repressed memory out of your brain that you've got back there so I don't think so\nI got every damn memory high overhead [laughter]\nYou don't remember them all all the time you know no you're not suddenly right here sitting here remembering everything that ever happened to you all

... threw him like a skin puppet some of the other questions\nAre of course we've gone over before and after yesterday we still aren't any closer to finding out who what when when did it happen where did it happen who else was there\nHow did she get to the party and how did she get home and let's focus on that last question for a minute according to her she rushed out of the house after just being assaulted by two boys at a party\nAnd she was afraid she was going to die she was terrified she was traumatized probably crying and ... you know ... and tears rolling down her face\nShe didn't have a driver's license it wasn't close to her house who drove her home she should be able to testify to who it was she didn't and who ever it was should be able to testify about her emotional state moments after\nThe incident happened when they got her in the car is what killed her credibility cannot tell you who it was and like I said I think she really believes her story\nShe she and only she believes her story [noise] she knew she fully believes it but here's the problem whoever Doug that out just kinda like dug up a\nPart of it and left the root system all and they didn't give her the background information that she needs to a flea out for the rest of us she named three people\nShe named Kavanaugh's buddy\nHe says that they're not but it wasn't that new one the other ... the bad thing that really the one that really makes her look bad has her best friend in high school that Leland a best friend goes I don't know the Kavanaugh guy and\nI never met him and I argued with ah I don't remember that incident I don't remember that party I don't remember that situation sour kind of get the feeling\nFrom just from the statements that they said she made that she was kind of like backing off going ah\nI don't want to be anywhere near this ms forward woman anymore you know she's not right\nI think she likes her because their friend lifelong friends and she's she ... she said I Believe her in other words she's letting everybody know granting mhm\nKnow don't don't don't I don't want to get too involved with her anymore\nAnd also don't want to get drug and our private hell on
