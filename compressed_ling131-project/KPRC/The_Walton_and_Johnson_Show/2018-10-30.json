yeah like it's a meaning\nManny Manny kind of thing yeah like a male privilege kind of thing so now we can't have that\nIt is I might have a gun\nAnd TV shows they're terrible pain right [laughter] okay I'm just standing and flexing to the music slightly but in their mind you're just stand in a way off a Gene Kelly I'm leaving over whales and you know we are not\nOf morning show that will jump up and down and pat ourselves on the back and it points that are at ourselves and take a bunch of credit for our good artwork were not no we're way too humble for that okay remember our humility\nIs one of our greatest quality ... or we like to say things routers stuff although in this particular case I think we owe it to the listening audience to go ahead and take a little bit of credit because of the tireless efforts of the Walton Johnson show\nI Would like you know that a city and I'm sure this is just the tip of the iceberg itch the\nThe the ... the match the sparks the fire a city in North Carolina has banned the Halloween candy that comes in the little black and orange rappers\nOh the generic a ... yeah twisted up but they you know certainly we well what's really weird about that and I was at the at the same candy in the black and the orange rapper then I can just put them in different rappers that threat\nBut it's not a very good candy it's well I think it's her impose your teeth right at your head and so we've often campaigned against them because first we'd never met anybody likes them like why did they sell it is\nSex some kind of evil Chinese pot or something to make us eat something and we've been they've been doing it since I've\nBeen a small child the black and white orange and also I think it's kind of a shot\nThey actually said they'd given uh the city or a week to no one likes it no one can give them out it's it's been ruled it's been done\nI like to see this take over the land I'm pretty sure it will and we like to see this every where\nIt's a weird chew we kind of a candy in a weird whack seep paper and then you have good ranks is the worst of all the Halloween candy nobody wanted but every year it ends up in people's baggage now uh\nBeen banned and like I say I think it's just the beginning of our great works\nYesterday my wife was a in a Kroger do wives do you know by picking up a few items areas for you as you\nWell mainly for other people and don't worry about me I'm fine [laughter] I'll be fine don't worry about you'll think of it when she gets back to take care of other people nearly other people that's all I care about\nAnd uh I guess the Kroger was full of people in costume oh ... ... and costume ... everybody's\nIn costume everybody's in and she said they had these um I guess you'd call them trick or treat stations I guess it was\nCome to your grocery store or a trick or treat at the grocery store if the kids were costumes and go these little endeavor every aisle there's a little boost and they can get some that can say trick or treat and get some candy\nAnd learn how to Mrs in a costume as well not oh she don't know about this she but she said\nShe saw by doing it and she said some of the candy category so I went up to trick or treat uh-huh and uh yeah I said well what are you didn't I said I Am today as a consumer I'm a shopper I Am a good and the guy for Katie okay so she wasn't denied that candy at\nTwo or three of these stations by just to claiming to be a consumer\nNow you and me we would have been denied right off oh yeah they would have been way go yeah just for the kids get out of men there are people\nAlways attribute the worst and motives demand whereas women are seen to be well you know women are nice and they've got good motives men are they're up to something why is this man tried to get candy\nThat's probably why Hillary Clinton can make horribly offensive racial jokes and everybody laughed and\nEverybody else must be fired or lose their TV show oh if a Republican said what Hillary\nSaid the media and the Democrats would find them until they were driven out of their chosen field must be driven\nAshley driven out of the nation out of the borders\nOf the nation from the genuine Hillary said when we come back I Hope it doesn't offend all of our listeners I'm sure it will offend most it probably won't offend any because it's Hillary Republican come on\nFinally a morning show that doesn't take itself too seriously the legendary radio titans Walt ... Johnson\nWait six six to trade\nYou'll get to on line classes instructional videos and the guy that will help you learn to build that second income it's all free call eight eight eight six six to trade they will even throw into free tickets to an upcoming workshop so you can ask questions and learn more\nMarket is making all kinds of moves are you ready to move with it called eight eight eight six six to trade\nEight eight eight six six to eight seven to three eight eight eight six six\nTo dark food's going to fight this is Lucas Arabic\nAnd Cindy look authentic inviting you and your pets to dynamite\nWhen I\nWalked in the Johnson listeners I Want to say thank you for the T cells and being a part of great health the super to use the cheated makes you go just gas walnut Johnson and don't forget to punch in the coupon coat W. J. for free shipping that's coupon codes W. J. hit apply [laughter]\nAnd by the way don't we all want to live in a third world country don't we all want to be living to be shipping and millions of people who live in mud huts and\nHave a Tin Roof over their head and have a third grade education and can't read cat right and we'll never learned to speak our language doesn't that sound like a plan for a future great society\nThey really cared about the people they wouldn't care about the four or five thousand that are maybe marching along the way here they would care about the million in the country that they left behind and maybe go help them they're\nJust like Tucker Carlson said last night to somebody about this immigrant caravan will Tucker shouldn't we be concerned about\nTens of thousands of people who just want a better life and want to come across the border and access to the better life that they see before the Tucker said well how about this tonight fifty million Americans are homeless and we'll go to bed\nBroke no place to live many of them don't have food\nThousands of veterans that serve the nation more don't get me started about how we treat the vet we have thousands of homeless veterans who said shouldn't we take care of them first of all you worry about the the hungry rabble from other countries should that they are isn't that our primary job\nAnd can't we help the hungry rabble and other countries while they're still in their other country there are millions and we do Hondurans and Guatemalans and the one to nations or what or wherever\nAnd we do help them but we can weigh cousin to them money and we send them a then\nNothing we should stop ever gets done about it because you the money doesn't go to them and it goes to the leaders of those countries\nDislike money that would somebody what's in let's say a Angola Merkel got up and I'm like I said you know what I Want to help the Americans so you'd better hurry or if you want to pick on angle I Want to send a bunch of German money to help the hungry American\nHomeless in the homeless veterans are there's a bunch of veterans that need the help and angular\nOr the leader in Germany says she can help I Want to step up I'm going to say now where she sent the money she was she sends it probably over to a ... who's a veteran he's a um affairs board intercepted by\nThe United states government Lansing below sea or gets her claws into it and then steers it to illegal immigrants coming across the border [laughter]\nThank you so that's the reason it's the same reason these people we try to help and other countries don't get the help because it goes through their leaders and they decided to do with\nThe money or I I was going to feed the hungry\nBut I said ah there's this new helicopter I've had to say it's a gunship and you got to add a gun you saw it demonstrated you won't want to you know so so from mark ... understand\nIs uh going to just turned tail and run\nShe said you're not going to have a\nTrial Merkel to kick around any longer [laughter] well she says you're not going to run for re election but not I don't think she's just going to walk away today are Koch runs out she had a shootout that
