thing what would you do I guess you just wear khakis with like a blue dress shirt and sweat all over yourself just perspiration everywhere well that seems like a lot of effort you'd have to keep thousand yourself with water it would be really hard plus the one part of the ... costume that I wouldn't want to get in to have you seen that new commercial where he\nIs real close up to the cameras

many hung up can you believe that you know there's this video arcade bears the radio today just speaking of Halloween you got to see this this mother took her kids to haunt you drive through car wash\nTheir these cute little kids and the workers are dressed as Michael Meyers and the clown from it so\nI Want to play a little audio from the video you could see this I came here see radio dot com if you go to the wall knew Johnson bar but listen to listen to their reaction to this and tell me if you think she made the right choice guy\n[laughter]\n\nGlad that [laughter]\nRight now we're on the radio so you can't see the video but the scariest part of the video might be the part\nWhere the mom was recording all this on her cell phone camera pans down and you see the little kid hiding on the floor of the car and it looks like he's laying in garbage or something to clean your car lady anyway speaking of ghost in Halloween and haunting and spooky stuff according to a new survey sixty percent of Americans think they've seen a ghost a ghost\nIf you're one of them I'm pretty sure you know who to\nCall your troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night\nYou experience the leaves of bread and your basement or addict you or any of your family ever seen as books vector or go\nGet the answer is yes then don't wait another minute pick up your phone and call the professionals goes talkers are courteous inefficient staffers on call twenty four hours a day to sort of all your supernatural elimination the we're re really wow\nHow 'bout that here's something that's scary although it doesn't involve and he goes there's this guy in Texas and he sprayed himself would break cleaning cleaning fluent on Tuesday supposedly to deal with a bug infestation in his new mobile home\nBeneath vacuumed himself off and he accidently ignited the fumes any exploded he's covered it second and third degree burns in it and it looks like he took a wall out of his\nTrailer that's what they say well that was covered with third degree burn when I found that I'm living in critical condition ... de\nHimself bug I spraying rape clean air flew it on his body and then find them that\nThough is the man was under the\nRight to I think it is a little clear I mean I think it's a little clear if he was under the influence [laughter] lucky for us somebody there was a recording the guy when he decided to solve is bug problem with break fluid cleaner and we have this audio to prove it\nOh man bugs Australia where's the brake cleaner\n[noise] [laughter] yeah so you know Andy Xie cleanup\n[noise]\nI'm okay [noise]\nThe truth is the guy that this happened to ... he actually can be one of our listeners had happened up in the magnolia area so I was hesitant to make that parity that you just heard I don't want to ... people that got hurt but he's still alive\nAnd it's kind of weird story so I didn't know what to do I'm Sorry folks I Apologize if I find it anybody but sometimes radio comedy just has to happen\nEven when it's even when it's great to the radio\nToday too\nThey don't give you all at the tail Fifteen opposite of people that do not learn about news and current events through celebrities but thirty percent said they do well in this town why numbered in the adult is so sad or joining I present so that celebrities should not\nShare their political didn't dare you keep a trap\nShould already ... percent say they should share their and ... percent said that can but probably shouldn't\nI don't care I was just somebody who was a ... a thing in the survey I don't care about any of this\nLawrence Taylor swift just came out and did it and so they said well let's see if that has an impact a less people watch the American Music Awards than any time ever in its history I tell you something right then and when she said that less\nPeople cared than anytime in Taylor Swift history forty percent said that when celebrities express their opinions it is not\nAll that effective Seventeen percent said somewhat effective and seven percent are pure sheep all there you go I said\nOh ah wherever definitely yeah if if that person that I liked says so that I'm doing it so it looks like a real problem is like the seven to nine percent of people who really by drink the Kool Aid we need to lop off some more low hanging fruit it sounds like\nEleven percent so they've donated to a cause because celebrity wanted them to [laughter]\n\nThey would give money to Jay Jay watts hurricane relief S. S. but not just some generic hurricane really oh\nWe do it for Jay Jay or maybe Marlo Thomas got him to give to saint Jude Jay Jay with hear about this and be impressed that you brought it to me sometimes for me\nOr did you hear about it or not yet but I'm sure he will at some point here about your your wonderful uh yeah\nHe'll throw a ball to you if you go to the gay well he'll he'll he'll give you a little bit of call with a bottle of water for somebody or something like that for what it's worth is\nA way more Democrats thinks that celebrities have ... so maybe that will tell you a lot right there why only on the liberal Democrats Democrats tend to be okay with it\nWhereas Republicans tend to give a crap blessed to have you ever heard of the walk away movement walk away can yeah yeah yeah I've heard all I I see a lot of postings\nAbout a lot about the walk away it it full name is called walk away from liberalism and this got Brandon\nA an openly gay former Democrat by the way sort of this movement he says he has seen a a large uptick in the number of people who say they are turning away from the Democratic party because of\nWhat they've done or tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid bison are receiving a lot of messages from people who say they will not vote Republican maybe for the first time ever because of the smear campaign at the very late in the millionaire oddly is a smear cycle out against a justice Kevin how\nDangerous guilty until you prove yourself innocent is for anybody in any circumstance\nWho wants to live in that country and that's the reason we came here as a reason Plymouth Rock happened that's the reason we through all the Indians off their land that took it away yeah that here we had an reasons for all that good a good idea a good plan right there just waiting for it\nI I Know that seems like a bad thing down here in Indian but think about\nWhat if you held onto your land all the time and yet I had I mean and and how can you have land when you don't believe in ownership of land yeah that really crossed them up right after this whole uh the you took our land when you said you didn't own any land they address that and that a ... a bail addressed\nThe hostile and hostile yeah like you but you said you didn't know how can we take your land and if you didn't own it\nAnd and then you throw a bunch of other Indians off that land in fact do the same thing we did we did it matter because you\nYou're just talking to a man happened to be ... it didn't you guys used to be like a New Hampshire or somewhere and now you're way the hell out here in North Dakota\nBecause you came I ran a bunch of other Indians off the land and just took it from them\nAnd he had in\nThere you can just tell it was like a a a yeah that's what I thought oh we've got an email from smart ass sunny a smart ass smarter Sonny says regarding that celebrities survey about\nPolitical opinions are you guys celebrities [laughter] no way sunny please are you kidding were radio where we're not part of the media and we're not celebrities by any means\nWe're barely part of the media were referred to in a by other people in the media as the bastard stepchild of all media\nAnd other things that sets this show and these gentlemen apart from the celebrities who are mouthing off about their political opinions is those celebrities do something else for a living\nAnd then they gave their political opinions they sing or they ban so they act or they're in a car to parties and say they do television shows and things for a living and pose for pictures molest various guys don't have anything else right\nIf I could pose for pictures as a living I probably would I Am not sure he's helping us but um but right yeah that's all we got we don't have anything else we don't really\nI mean I think if I were put into movies I Would win like a dozen Oscars and the first ten years I was in the business oh easy a but nobody puts me in one\nShe put me on a movie stand back waiting for the sparks fly because they're they're scared and jealous of your well that's probably a hills in the middle East that my giant\nPain is scares awful lot of people [noise]\nIt's jealousy quite frankly where you get from these people that here is a elucidate ing are incredibly a crystal and clear opinions on things that are thought processes and people are like whoa\nWhen I hear they're like that's like so amazing actually scares up because it's so good that's a lot of what happens and a lot of things we do on the show like\nYou know why does he\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTo do [noise]\n[noise]\nI Know\nWho to bang bang\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nCandy\nOr the bad\nGuy it's All right we'll take your clothes off later how you doing\nIt so Americans answer to diamond then silk the weather with all the white die but it's just right already is a diamond in silk rectify\nThat speech if they qualify they bought by all the ...\nThe ... that was good at going to diving so they said\nThey're going to lead the party of Jim Crow the party or the KKK the party that Tom okay you're okay\nThe party of slavery and the party that is hold and black people back still to this day the body of put us into black box a Democrat what did he go hold them back no ...\nThat's right and I loved jazz right is that one good I'm of a diamond or silk and they that's right girl the other one does most of the talking and the other one is the emphasis we'll ... it was like the exclamation\nYeah that's right mhm\nShe didn't get to talk is you get to see her own thing it'd be truly Oh yes she is a few things you gotta let this the first I guess I guess diamond Gillett die but just got to really get it out\nRight well she's the one that knows how to write to me that's like a lot rides kind of the old like Jesse Jackson stuff\nThe point that a lot of nice things though that happened just during the ... visit to the oval office for example that said we uh we like the fact that the president by passes the so called black\nLeaders in the community and nuts and just goes straight to the people mhm bring it to the ... the people of good\n[noise] mhm [laughter] yeah you're right that's right Johnny did\nCommandeer the White House for about twenty five\nMinutes but Trump knew what he was doing drugs is not an idiot you just started going and he talked about some things that may have been some some things that might not have made since but that may well you're quite the show drop\nDrop sitting there and said if this gets ... percent boost and black support out there I'll take it it's worth the time and that's it and all he has to do is just sit there and listen and seem interested\nBut uh yeah well it can be found is that the only time things got a little heat it was when Kanye kind of alluded\nTo the fact that he was Jesus and Trump said ah no I ...\nI I I I I guess\nCould have happened yeah you could say that some place else you know the real easy easy come on now\nIt looks a little bit like Mississippi where some of the the houses are now just what used to be houses just slabs were you know what would say I am doing them in Mississippi and Alabama and ended up the Florida Panhandle a lot of times\nYou would see these beach communities from the other hurricanes where you have the sticks still of the high lifted houses ... steel up out of the water and you had to still left well the storm so bad it blew the steel down there is no steel and slapped\nThe steel or are there any more ... it ... it took even little sticks and the and the remnants in bloom all down and it was all gone it was just I got a flat surface with all the debris sitting on top of it that wiped out\nLike some giant took it and shoot the board in the house of cards all came down but the good news is\nThere's not going to be that big argument with the insurance company is whether it was when our rain or water damage\nThis was hurricane civil but this was her and this was when straight up a lot of water damage too but I mean none of that does that argument that happened and Harvey well and those kind of came after Harvey\nYou sure that wasn't just flood ... they have flood insurance now but I bought the hurricane insurance but you know this was a flood\nBut it was a flood caused by ah I don't want to hear it down and they don't want to hear it believe me they're not good hands people who are just pulling up the van hoping to give you some checks the main job of these guys these insurance didn't gestures is to not give you a check you keep that in mind\nFor those who were in a hurricane zone and maybe listening you're probably not because you you really got more on your mind right now the staring at your pile of debris and thinking of what you're going to do next but\nI Hope you got a plan other than just the insurance guy I'm just saying\nDo me a little more help\nGotta work around the insurance guys you got to dance with him a little bit\nThat I've been there before\nThey don't just willing to come up and help you with a big check go you know what let me see if I can be of some help here let's get this thing rebuilt\nBurst they'll ask you should we even rebuild it I mean\nThere could be another hurricane just like this when do the same damn thing why should we rebuild this that'll be a question will be asked\nYou'll be going like cause I bought the lot of an eye out and what else is going to be good for ... was here to put it in\nBack in case it went away so let's put it back when you say\nAnd why are we asking these questions I mean that's the reason that page you all that money all that type you remember all those years when there were no claims four or five years went by and no not a single claim was made the payment winning every month like a clockwork\nYeah and we appreciate that because if it was ever laid even ten days would cancel your policy\n... amazing\nThey are allowed in the business of maturing thing they are in the business of collecting money and then try to not insure when the cubs yesterday we talked about the limousine company\nThat was in charge that limousine where the twenty people get killed New York state yeah and uh the the father\nOr that the company is owned by the family the Hussein family the boys are one in trouble when they got in jail right ahead I guess recently slipped off to the middle east or wherever you went don't worry I left the boy a job at home the boy the sun\nOr when the police went to arrest him had his bags in the car\nYeah he's a pet your dad's place he was on his way and they caught him right before he could I guess driving the lord or maybe had a little private place somewhere I was just going to pick up some milk [laughter] with all you weren't lift the best\nI acted in the bank or no because what if I may go while I was picking up new you get ... to ... is editor you're going to pick up the milk yeah I think and you know here\nHe just he's just ... ... now that he had to go back for something or or you know somebody called in the white get to the car in five minutes the old man a lecture him\nI told you leave now one day I leave that immediately [laughter] oh no I've got to do this and I've got to do that ... and took that and you get out now\nAt the end of course they mentioned to the judge that he had bags back in the car which made her believe he was a flight risk so he had to surrender is us and Pakistani passports\nOh boy Hillary had been elected you would've needed those passports anyway it up day for the Hussein\nBecause that hate or ... officers even have to have a passport borders whether we need them for come and go as you wish\nMhm\n[noise] everybody's happy to have ... out there more and more people every day I think our and very loud and the Trump bandwagon\nIt he may just be that the media is going to be at some point the last holdout oh yeah even some of the Democrats change their mind eventually but the media now that they've broadcast it out in public like they're kind of stuck with it\nIs that the amount of negative news on Donald Trump is a new all time high now Ninety two percent the keep judging it but there was one report that\nThe media mainstream media across the United states national news everything they spent fourteen minutes\nThis entire summer\nTalking about the economy\nIt's too too good so you know we're not going to cover that good is not when I'm covering drop cover good right now the market's been down here that we can get a couple of big losses yesterday the day before facts that Trump so they'll start mentioning it\nYou watch if it's negative Trump spiraling down to the market\nTrump's magic ride over so much for this so called gray to Trump's allies catch up with him [laughter] truck touch some woman which he didn't want to be taught and what's sad is that they may actually be and I'm pretty sure they are manipulating the market to go down to cost me thousands of dollars\n\n\nAfter all this Friday [laughter]\nSelling\nAvon\n\n\n\n\nIt has been pointed out to the people to keep up with this kind of stuff that it was all this very day twenty seven years ago\nClarence Thomas got to give his rebuttal to Anita Hill's graphic sexual harassment allegations at the Supreme Court which included\nBy the way a strange story about a pubic hair on a can of coke ... that was that she will offer coke for a couple of weeks I was I was going and\nAnd I mean it's you know that why Clarence are denied\nAll of the naughty charges and to call this whole process nothing but a high tech lynching member that which was very effective words coming from a black man yesterday it was he said I Would have preferred an assassin was bullet to this kind of living hell\nAnd technically they said it was pretty mild\nCompared to what they did last week yeah but in Nineteen Ninety One it seemed pretty bad 'cause we hadn't seen just match the and she ... and under handed in low down these disgusting Democrats

just jinx it more than anything else really something that you call it good it's the exact opposite\nWe got this this is the guy who said don't bother buying those Facebook or Twitter that's a flash in the pan thanks for that\nAdvice whether it's now they're going down now so I was right eventually could have made me so rich I could have left the show Joe quadruple leaders ten times but I mean after that after that though ... city trouble\nDown your [laughter] just watch 'em drop what we're going for it [laughter] [noise] yeah that's right I'm always right if you wait long enough for it always comes around\nIn Nineteen sixty nine Nineteen hundred\nGlobal warming men are those are the two that are more powerful than than Michael I'm nothing about global warming or President Trump's fault but now of course it is this one girl eleven years old\nWas visiting her grandparents house when Michael came Karen into Georgia not not right off the coast not right into Florida She's in Georgia in the house\nWhen the hurricane lifted up a big metal carport up into the air and slammed down onto her grandparents house it went through the roof of the living room and he had her in the head and killed her\nMost reason I always go with a two story freak accident is of course the right way to to look at this I'm very sad or getting a Michael was much like I\nSaid this early this morning much like abroad tornado than it was a hurricane much because it was just a huge swath of a hundred and eighty miles per hour a hundred and sixty miles per hour winds but one fifty seven it went so fast by the time I got through the panhandle and was bursting its way into Alabama\nAnd Georgia is still coming strong they still had eighty Ninety per hour winds coming into Atlanta I don't think that's part was prepared properly no I don't think we receive a category three hurricane\nThey thought it's going to hit Florida and then it's going to kind of you know Peter out my head didn't Georgia was well prepared for LSU or this week you stop it by watching the footage of the the Florida game they're kind of looking forward to it they say when I when\nI ain't nobody ever look forward to death man so I'm just saying if you boys want to get fired up or something about how George is laughing at you and\nPutting up pictures in the locker room you know you a little girl suits and stuff like that I made it the Gurley month it's happening right now as we speak so I mean I'm just saying I knew if you want to get fired up about and do something about\nIt but that's all right maybe Matthew McConaughey ... you know it gives us speeches to Texas I Am I going to be over there a Saturday\nOn game day it's a two thirty start I'm going to get there early you want to be there ah Matthew and I'll walk and I go you know we got what tight with go he'll walk me into the locker room or we didn't me as a surprise uh inspirational speaker\nOr we think we are we uh we do know the never had a bad word for us but we don't understand any of those words Illinois when he did or not really understand it might be saying you son the best but we don't know because we can't understand it\nBut he seems to like is a lot he's still call back if we didn't get on the on the line that's you know I guess if we can get them on the phone is mine yeah so I'm probably\nGoing to stay away from things like alright alright stuff like that landed yeah he's got there and that's where the horns I'm not going to try to run something like that path to the ... the boys\nYou know what it's like a it's like a tennis serve don't over think it left the body and the instinct takeover okay then you over take it you're not going to get that hundred and twenty miles\nPer hour serve a look at it more like a golf swing ... think it ... I think it is you left off your shoulders you ... him out of here today and then they grow in your head down\nYour show you know don't move your head do do you think like they don't move your eyes keep your eye on the ball you think about almost ... you will completely missed the bowl do duck your shoulder do not last shoulder and then you're going to hit you're going to keep\nShank ... could come with you when you go into the locker room and I've never been into you know the the boy is you know college football players luck\nOr probably pretty good reason for that yeah it's a no go ahead and say no and I had it coming back and there's probably\nNot a good idea either let girls in their district they let female reporters there no you don't have your credentials though you know you're not credentialed do I need to put them on a land you're Jesus I can you you don't have a pro Claritin you talking about\nThe laminated passes as right\n'cause I got good credentials\nAnd our girls who glasses have nice uh passes yeah man a laminated around their neck they do they come in and they they talk to coach at halftime when he's on his way to the he's behind twenty three points a coach or what do you do to to get them to get it turned around out there\nWell first episode probably a stop wasting my time talk symbol on the field when I could be an air plotting the strategy that he's not going to say anything to her because she works for the the network this broadcast and this\nAnd that would be like telling the other side exactly what you're going to back telling you you say one crossword to hurt your Gatorade contractors out the window of heart does or\nDoesn't that liberated address lucrative he wants to Chicago temperatures are dipping into the twin cities\nThis weekend calmed down the shooting over the weekend and they are talking about snow in Texas because there's a new where they're coming out real actual coal from moving in Amarillo listeners\nAre probably going to get a little that white stuff this weekend I once had to spend about uh six hours and the Cracker Barrel and Amarillo because they closed the highway up to do much where I was on my way to\nEnd it was all shut down down heart northwest Amarillo it's even further up the panhandle they got a Seventy percent chance of snow in the forecast Sunday night and then Monday morning that dropped off a little bit but ah yeah you people\nThat are ... and you want to see those gigantic tumble weeds that are as big as your car and roll across the ground right up there and north of Amarillo between del heart and do must do must Boise City beaver you will see some of those giant big ass\nTumble weeds are old and across the road that's the part of Texas it's further north than parts of Oklahoma yeah yeah that's where the smoke coming\nAlright possible snow that tough they can handle it up and it probably won't last long because you know the temperature just tips for a little bit and then it runs right back up yeah\nAnd by the way they did you think they know how to drive on ice up there and you crazy they still I got it figured out those trucks and the ditches everywhere man and she had on his truck district ours might've been from California or something I have no idea\nBy the way the weather service does say that even though you're excited about this the weather services calmed down early season snowfall does not necessarily indicate that it will be any colder or harsher\nFor the entire winter season we'd like to think it might be slower it didn't it didn't get a lot of snow up in those ski town that really needed it so safety for the horny toads and like it's okay that's good\nTo finally a morning show that doesn't take itself too seriously the legendary radio titans Walt ...
