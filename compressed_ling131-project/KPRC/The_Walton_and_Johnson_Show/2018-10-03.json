years old when it came out and I didn't have anything else to do because I couldn't drive a car and I didn't have any money\nBut did you know that I probably am I was surprised to learn this duck hunting you know duck on the other game and Super Mario brothers well everybody knows that well apparently if you're playing duck hunting single player mode\nYou can use the second controller to control the duck did you know that\nI had no idea I told us to Ramon robust the other day from the Michael berry show and he he looked at me like yeah Kenny didn't know that the loser [laughter] and

whatever I Am anyway in other news there is a Catholic minister at Cleveland State university who was fired because he liked her friends post about a same sex marriage [noise]\nSo I guess there is something you can get fired for in the Catholic Church after all good to know kidding my mom's Catholic I'm allowed to poke fun at the Catholic so little but hey look we all know what the Catholics are dealing with right now\nIn all seriousness the Catholics needed a total rebranding they got to get rid of the pope\nGet a new pope Pope Francis ain't doing it for you guys folks seriously do you think do you think that that guy is helping your cause not in the least bit he isn't helping you even a little bit nothing that the pope is doing right now is making the Catholic Church more popular and he may have covered up sexual assault and I know it's weird to go from telling one liners into that but it had to be set folks\nCase up and also this is you know this is a segment of the show where I Try to inject a little news stories into one segment I I give you a whole bunch of news right at the end of the show\nI dropped out segments on topics I argue with Adam ... about about grammar and then in the last show I I just insert twenty news stories in the same segment maybe I'm not a good broadcaster after all but anyway it really exciting news if you like pizza really cheap garbage pizza dominoes has been testing self driving delivery cars\nAnd there's this video where they that's been going viral it's got two guys in Vegas getting a pizza from one of the driverless cars\nTo get this alert when it pulls up to enter a coat on the side of the car window goes down they grabbed their pizza and the car drives off and here's the kicker you don't have to tip you don't have to tip that's amazing to me\nIt's kinda neat because it goes a\nSpeed limit of the nation tape\nIt's one of the only car the size of his top plan right here\nJohnny us tax code to kind of a good to be out of here I\nMean the idea All right so anyway I something occurred to me though after I heard this news\nWhat if we didn't have pizza delivery drivers what if it was just robots well he would be nice that you don't have to separate but think about that well I tell you about this next news story\nThe other day in Wisconsin Sheboygan County Wisconsin a pizza delivery driver saved a woman from or abusive ex boyfriend\nJust guy named dean Hoffman he's fifty five years old he faces several kinds of domestic abuse after allegedly entering his ex girlfriend's house uninvited where it's been alleged\nThat he beat her up and tighter Robin ... mouth and he held are there for quite a while\nPolice arrested the pizza delivery driver they noticed a woman inside the house a police arrested a Hoffman after a pizza delivery driver noticed a woman inside the house sorry there's a big difference there the pizza delivery driver wasn't arrested the pizza delivery driver showed up and he found this woman in the house who was\nMouthing the words helped me like silently she was she was trying to you know sort of lip sync them help me and call the police the driver said it's pretty scary gave the guy a pizza and he noticed the girlfriend behind them she she had a black guy that was quite visible and she mouthed out the words call the police\nWell according to the criminal complaint the victim of fifty seven year old woman started dating often and twenty sixteen and they lived together until August twenty anti that's when they had a break up\nThe woman moved to a home near second ... ... it's a town hints history in the town anyway investigators say around one o'clock he entered the home without knocking without permission\nAnd um yeah him and then eventually she was saved two and a pizza delivery driver shut up anyway I don't want to leave you with horrible news before I take off this morning so consider this\nTodd ... and ... they were on a date in Las Vegas last year when that mass shooting happened on manned in Mandalay Bay casino it's now been one year since then\nTodd was shot three times while shielding her from bullets but he survived well they just got married yesterday in
