of\nThe [laughter]\nThat after the crowd started screaming the singing continued while she's on the floor having fall off the stage huh the singing never stopped which meant of course she was not singing at all well I think that meant that she's just the consummate professional and the show must go on\n... mind that's\nNow [laughter]\n[noise]\nToo many steps for too many steps the crowd reacted that made a bunch of noise watching her plummet like she did was at a at a casino show ... more if this is done in a place where she was playing wanted us to uh give them a nice meal mentioned

during the Sunday football games NFL Network report I wondered where she went\nYou should be on one of the networks NFL Network now\nMelissa Stark ... little little bomb cute you know sound like a familiar name got hit in the head with a ball during a pre game report I don't know if a punter was button or somebody who you know throwing in the midst of anyway she ... back in the head with a ... from a book ball but that was a I think\nThat was in London she was actually out until you yes she was over there covering the London thing\n... you should get all pretty good [laughter] it didn't hurt or nothing 'cause she kind of smiled and then just kept talking\nWe're I Wonder why they all came from you say to somebody spare or intentionally or not I don't know it just came flying out of the I'm sure they can track it down maybe one of those deals are practicing punting you know did a good guy who got away from it I don't know where my ball go what upside the girls had over there\nBut yeah probably put their behavioral analysts unit on it in a they'll they'll figure it out the exact trajectory you know where it came from and was responsible for letting it loose\nHere's what I here's the only thing I I I learned out of everything I saw yesterday in the national football league if the Jacksonville Jaguars don't immediately higher Colin Kaepernick or they're just\nRace it us right it's all ... all you know full fact this is not the fact that this damn in a as a fact\nJak back so good at dawn and do you watch them make excuses when cabinet don't play your day\nYeah when cap and goes out there it sucks up simply having him hired and us to see happen it you know he's bad and planes I'm like I'm Wondering if he still could even if he got out there\nMm Mm and I am assuming you're you're buying mega millions the tickets are sure one point six billion I don't know if they changed the sign or if they can't even make it say one point six is they have enough spot it just goes yeah nine nine nine and then at\nThe ... to go after that they will have got to be over a billion dollars yeah biggest lottery Janelle ... have you on how much you'll get so I mean that's how much the uh\nIf ... if you took the annuity that's what it would pay out too but if\nThat now that it's at one point six even after they take the taxes out of it it's still a billion\nDollars they say cash jobs and taxes out and it's kind of came in under a billion dollars very disappointing but you know you've been promised to be an adult and you don't have a billion dollars if I'm sitting there with such as you would have more money than Paula Abdul six to eight hundred million dollars\n\n[noise]\n\nBlue ... boom\nBoom boom\nBoom\nTo [noise]\n\n\nTo bang bang\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nYeah just dumps them quick calculation on the care of had you know those people that just can't wait to get to America and the love our country can we come up with a ... a ... a caravan sounds so cheerful or like like the children's caravan of ... do you like invasion force better okay the invasion force\nColumn do is is a little over a thousand miles away and they're walking to America juggernaut\nAnd they need to be here in two weeks\nIs when the election is and that's kind of what this was all originally orchestrated and paid for so they're going to have to walk between Seventy and Seventy five miles a day\nTo get here on time and they've had to bring a lot of ... because the children is what they will use yeah when they get the cameras out and start shaming Trump looking at Trump's joined all these children last time I checked those children ... and those people came here on their own nothing to do with drawn\nTo it that's all they show on NBC and CNN is a sad faces of children and the pregnant mothers you airing babies with mental they don't show the guys that looked like him is Thirteen gang\nMembers and and they're in their spotted yesterday a without verification 'cause he didn't go down there and ask them they would lie anyway but if it looks like a lot of a Middle Eastern types up in the middle of the Honduran crowd to know they're all just spot and I'm just saying\nSomething about those stats Seventy Seventy five miles a day probably alerted due to the fact that they're not walking to taxes now they're being bussed detects they're\nPutting them on trucks flat beds buses whatever and they they're the photo of them walking ... column\nAlways a ... mile long line of them walking\nLeg or arm and see a video of news lies to you yeah they don't there are things they don't show you there's things they show you that are misleading\nBecause we'll have news anymore we have propaganda the propaganda shows you these poor straggling maybe with a small child perched up on your shoulder like you're walking around at Disney World and ... and maybe show them you know the the kids got Mickey Mouse backpack\nOn it is just like your kid only disadvantage because meanwhile Trump ... welcome man gave up all kinds of cool game show prizes its border\nWith civil and if you tuned into the weather channel every now and then is to try to figure out the timing of hurricane will of the supposed across across Mexico and I think it's going to be a little early 'cause the invasion force his way south\nAnd will is going to come across like mid Mexico today part of it\nAnd uh it would have been so nice if the vet during hadn't hadn't really worked out better but they're going to have to be caravan through some pretty soggy flooded area\nThere was a\nMention from one of the leaders and these people that have leaders your your led to believe that this whole thing you think about the logistics of this thousands of of ah meals\nIs that these people are eating three times a day and they're ... they're supplying them with food and they are the least bit tired or are starving and we only seven thousand meals a day who's provide twenty seven thousand who's got that money\nA trucks thousands of people on trucks and flat beds in buses who's paying for that you know Mexicans are volunteering I deal with a lot of Mexicans it'll volunteer anything for free\nThey're not out there that's helped these poor people that are with our Eighteen wheelers at our buses yeah there's like seven or eight thousand of them outside made all like a sandwich okay\nLet's say let's help 'em out twenty seven thousand sandwiches please\nSay sandwich 'cause I thought it might have been considered raises if I'd said tortillas\nWe're ... we're sandwich yes but I you know clearly it's probably more like not family is probably tacky toes ... big like that so carefully\nStaged you gotta watch what you say but in Mali me there are forces\nBehind this is not much eh children it's like it was brought up by somebody yesterday these children that show with these are young men with a a a little kid on their back and there's you don't really see a mother they said these a lot of these children are being packed as something to sell when I get there and the human slavery yeah\nThese are martyr chips they're going to sell when they get inside the usa they got connections\nInside the usa which will help them sell these people into bondage\nWe call it it is like slavery they'll lock these people up\nAnd we'll have to stay in a safe house quote unquote while they put them out to work and take a slice of their salary and it's one of those deals where they never get off the treadmill because they always do know is the coyote more money it's a nefarious thing\nAnd the best thing we can do for these people is Joe in spite of what you hear from Geraldo\nIs to block um cold at the door is Trump's going to be able to do that and we are we talking National Guard and we talk and a tanks are armored vehicle well is Geraldo said yesterday ... you're being a typical alarmist get\nWell suited to shoot him who were bringing the troops to the troops who the sheer\nMowed down the first wave set yeah maybe one or two in the ...

Frank [laughter] we're all in danger [noise]\nUs created in tiny [noise]\nSorry for many scary\n[laughter] [noise]\nDetroit to come up for you it's coming for us ally now people we've\nGot a lot of email about friday show it didn't get on the app because we ended the show a little early on friday around this time I got some news from the hospital where my dad was that he'd had a heart attack and he ended up dying this past friday [noise]\nBut I did want to say thanks to the people that College Station medical center where he was because they were amazing through all of it and it's one of those agonizing day long who will he come but you know they they started his heart back up and they were waiting for him to maybe wake up or not\nWhich turns out he didn't there's no way they can make it pleasant no but they did everything humanly possible to make it good for the family and\nTo treat him with the respect and everything and uh uh I don't I couldn't possibly named them all from the surgeon that originally operated on which we ended up causing him to have a heart attack and be weakened enough to die from it\nBut I'm Tiffany a Brittany I think and several others at College Station and I just wanted to say about my dad that one of the things he was most proud about in his eighty eight years was that way back in the day\nHe played football for the temple Wildcats and he still followed them\nTo the very last and he knew what year they won the state championship and what that one year not long ago he went it wasn't easy for him but he went up to Dallas they play to Jerry's house up there and they lost the state championship\nBy just a couple of points I don't remember the score now he probably did um but he was so proud of the fact that he was from temple played for the wild cats and uh it was it was all you know very important to him and who is history wow\nI and I I have spent zero time tracking what a southeast intro\nSaid what are your high school did did you play for\nThe Trojan not a lot of those areas you were on the ... oh yeah the ... to ... you know is that I was there back in his days this was the late forties I think they played both ways yeah all the time without a face mask specially in small towns and yeah the the leather\nHelmets in one [noise] yeah my old man had pictures of that kind of thing and uh I I look back on him now and I when I was a kid I'd see pictures they may look at that old time and stuff yeah and now I see pictures of like when they show first started oh yeah and say look at that old\nTime [laughter] I Try not to the pictures of ourselves from thirty five years ago because now we are that die it's just that that can't be right yeah yeah I don't remember it that way for sure it's it's a there's a\nA a website that color rises pictures are actual blacks and whites pieces of video and there wasn't that much video ... film actually but it's been turned into video film from World war one not World War two but World War one and they've taken all that video\nOr film and a colorized it with the computers they have today in the east coast and live like somebody shot it with code of chrome or whatever and it's amazing how different the perception of those people are when you get together\nIt doesn't look old old time me and and disconnected from us today it looks real it looks like those were real people dying in war\nYeah they just think about the stuff you're old man saw an eighty eight year in a suite from when he was like say six seven years old\nIn Nineteen thirty lived through all the depression and all those hard times which is I mean that cast you in stone when you lived through years like that he has that's the reason we won World War two he was more time\nAnd they didn't throw things away they didn't live 'em disposable world ah everything they had they worked hard for it and they respected that they kept it and made it better\nAnd it was great dad and I feel bad about leaving you know hanging on the friday show but I yeah I don't feel that bad about it I ... it's funny when you're when you're dead or what when you lose a parent a you suddenly find out from other people\nThat you know a lot of people that you know in your life have lost one or both of their parents and especially at our age yeah it's hard at this age not to have multiple friends who don't have either their parents anymore so I feel very lucky my mom still alive\nAnd she's you know hurting goes after sixty six years of ...\nAnd palm hand I'm assuming probably brothers couldn't be ... you know father and son those handy boys the hand they're a handful of Bensalem hand boys watch out more from Daphne, Alabama now you know we're not on the radio and Daphne, Alabama oh these boys is working hard\nTo get

clean most of the floor of the barn up\n[noise] and I tell you what clean up the bar and is still a job I Do not enjoy I wouldn't think so I've never claimed one ever can I see it on television it like a big house a horse who I just like Helen Costner clean about well about a little stall in a barn on yellow stone a few months\nAgo yeah he had a pitch fork and and now I get what the pitch for his phone never really know why they had the little food for well it's so that the er hey I guess the either the puck drops out in the hay stays on or the the drop that the I'm not sure how it works\nThey have rocks out number you maintain that it's kind of like a shift in for a goal\nIs to separate or is all it is you separate now hey prone to poop\nBall a lot of times in these horse stalls you got a what's called chip would you've got a seat or ... yeah it was like ... year or the odor and the whole ... you don't\nUp and you want you want to leave the chips behind because they're kind of expensive okay you don't want to throw away all your tips with the poop so a lot of times you can sift through it and keep a lot of euro wood chips and throw away Europe I saw Kevin Costner do it and I feel privileged well what's that old boy's name a\nSasha crash or whatever his name as soon as a side you know all the dirty work\nAs a good and you know you don't have to do that I Know and then we all have to like to do it like doing it I Choose to do it\nSometimes there are certain people in this world that need menial tasks form it gives their brain\nA chance to drift off and think about other things doing chores that don't require a lot of thought that's how he would think repetitive labor and that kind of thing 'cause mine off into the missing ... exactly it lets you think\nSo I recommend it I did find it hard to believe that he was out there riding Brock after\nPassing coven that's probably a little bit of a stretch what with the stitches are still in his belly\nYeah that was already ... the bucking horse\nI Know plenty of rough tough cowboys and grew up poor and\nNo not which you're not and you know I read a horse STD hard as what Jacqueline\n[laughter] although I Will say this is\nA cat Kevin Costner has made for that role he's quite good at it\nI now here's what I Wonder if it is going to come back right or if they're going to go ahead and kill off Kevin Costner\nBecause he's too expensive to keep on the show and they ... they used to get started and then they'll keep altogether characters in just have him be\nDad used to be there from what I read about these into that that was the original plan\nBut it got more popular than they even expected and I think they get a little leaving him around for a little while maybe so yeah so that'd be fine with me I Am curious as to what the guy's name is now yeah he had a cool name like zipper rep for low rent boiler yeah\nAnd you you'd never guess who that was because you've seen him and other things but he looks completely different in that role that's coal Hauser\nAnd if you saw him out of character is it oh well I Know that guy and I had no idea it was him so he's doing what's known as I Know about that a real\nTear your hand often or any well he plays a good bad 'cause he's just understated enough like a real bad asked\nWould be this kind of like he doesn't go around bragging about what a bad as easy to just take care of bad assed business [laughter] and they always\nOr by the way if you're if you go to work for Kevin Costner first of all don't let them\n... ... you don't want that

were the central and South America that are Mexicans primarily a you know the Mayans in the ... had chocolate and so on I got chocolate in Europe the very first\nChocolate us white people had was in beverages\nLike chocolate milk ... are hot chocolate they ... have the hot chocolate and that was the way you are for a cold morning for hot chocolate I mean it was years for anybody admitted like a

didn't have any pasta and a heavy tomato sauce and they liked no pizza loves going to make pizza\nAnd getting made nothing to live off of the Mediterranean diet are probably ... what the Romans say mhm smashed up chick peas and bread\nAnd a little olive oil there was also used to eat little tiny mice yeah they did back the tender one so they didn't have to worry about them they would just chew the bones and everything\nThat also do a thing where they would bake a like a big turkey or something and stuffy entire cavity with turkey\nWith little birds cool\nAnd you would eat the little birds and crunch the bones of the whole the whole thing was supposed to be good that's the grows that's disgusting\nAnd not everybody liked what you either have you know one of a\nWell to me or you know

way down so now he's running in the uh the full thing that's a gateway gateway ... drug he wants\nTo be governor and probably a return to the White House in solving it with more of his big Bush feet we just don't need that\nOr if that's about the only problem you're going to have when you vote straight Republican ticket is he's going to be covered on that\nYeah I think he got a\nYou've got to break him out there you don't want to vote him and do anything but where are you a vote if you hadn't done early vote yet you should uh maybe they'd be good\nFor you they you hit that straight are\nQuicker that way but but then you still have to go and review\nYou know you got a double check all your answers you go back in ... you know ... is that did you see at Bush named pop up just go and take Mr Alamo boy out of that yeah you don't want him in there you know it'd be just like Clinton's we don't want any more bushes and the White House who had enough now bushes enough
