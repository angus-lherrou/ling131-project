it ... me mob scene for a while and I it's funny but it's also sad\nAsking bill a check after the game what he thought about the uh\nThe play of his of his mounted Texans we said well you know I don't discourage the defense from scoring every now and then but primarily we're a field goal team [laughter] that's how you met the sale Brian\n... where you get to use the same ... the battle judge Judy tries to your belly check any answers to it right at press conferences and stuff the below Brian is his turn district some steam into ... you know the audience is like\nA field goal team like I said that the tea and you are close game winning or losing that's probably going to be more losses than wins but the games are going to be close every time if there is a good news for the Texans that the rest of the team the teams are in their division\nAlso pretty bad and I think he's still might actually get play or even the jaguar sucked\nYesterday yeah they got their ass handed to them by the
