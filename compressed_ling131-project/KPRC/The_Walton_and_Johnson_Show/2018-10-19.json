they're clearly on the left the gay pride burger what fine whatever him I got nothing against gay people but the pride whopper your exploiting the fact\nThat there are people that care about the algae Beatty cue elemental peace movement and you're trying to sell burgers off of it now that it's something else really and then the next neutrality thing that drove me nuts and then if you remember when

anyway now Burger King is selling a new Greenberger for Halloween but supposedly makes you three and a half times more likely to have a nightmare\nIt's the nightmare burger is is a marketing strategy

earlier this week yeah expect him to win his race\nThis was the uh the plot that\nEddie Murphy movie a distinguished gentleman\nHe ran the place of a guy that died but had a big name and they figured he was going to win the election anyway\nAs a dead man change you named this guy's name and you can take his place\nBecause despite being found dead on Tuesday he is poised to win the election at the state legislature in less than three weeks that with the word won't get out and people will vote but I recognize that name though they know the names that you know I don't even know who they're running in stead of him\nThat Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi all these filthy maggots get reelected over and over again 'cause it's a name people know in a certain place\nPeople are also a little curious and a little upset might be concerned about why former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio was one of the ones in mixing it up over there and businesses birthday party\nOr I can tell you why I Believe ...

he was breaking a lawyer salt\nAnd Hoff was a big time Republican donor gave a lot of money or if Joe and others\nYou talk about your family values and stuff well believe me that that had nothing to do is going against anything family or doing anything against the law\nIn any politician when it comes up to the family values money's got to\nCome first in front of family values every chance they don't have much money he's going to have much money oh yeah I'm there for me I'm I'm a yet but we eat out just surf I'm On board so Roger that that's where I'm at work my friend follow the money this O'Rourke character\nThirty eight million dollars to use against Ted Cruz and he still\nBehind like eight ten points now if he doesn't\nSpend all of that money by election day and two and a half weeks give or take what's he going to do with it it was money now that's what I mean what's he gonna do he\nObviously is going to lose this race and when he does\nHe's going to run for something else why isn't he spending it all Democrats are already talking about how he'd make an excellent and vice presidential candidate to go with whoever\nWhile he's an Hispanic Kennedy that yes I Love about him hits it's like a Kennedy but from Mexico\nThey've done such a good job only he's not ... promoting a sky nationwide that every place else they think he's pretty cool it's only Texas\nWhere he's not going to win\nAnd so if somebody said yesterday had well this guy he's he's got so much positive press all of the country of course you've got positive they designed it that way\nBut even if he loses Texas being the state is he will get a whole lot of name recognition\nAs somebody said they said well why are they doing better was in ... cruises said because Texas is still Texas\n[laughter]\nJust how it's going to be a blue wave and going to happen\nSo he's going to run but he's not done you'll see this maggot back a cop and back up and running probably for vice president or something\nAgain do you ain't none with him just coaches and impassioned from there already she's not gonna waste all that George Soros money that his\nYou're done with a million dollars is trainer\nKnew the reigning

[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nSee I'm bottom dropped except for the lack of radiation it was more of a a really wet for NATO happy and really wide than it was getting huge I mean it really that flat and everything like a tornado does\nBut um well get jury this to you know we had a bunch of alignment over there to restore they said they're going to restore the power\nWay faster\nThan say Puerto Rico we're still hasn't had much of its power restored but we said a cruise crucial Oklahoma\nTexas Arkansas gruesome Missouri\nCrews from New Mexico even all went over there to help but the power back in order and they ... they say it's going faster than they thought and they're going to have the power restored within sixty days\nNot fast enough for the people that don't have at least sixty days is a long long time they have\nTo realize the Puerto Rico's what a year and a half or not and that if they still have don't have power but they're an island it's tough to get a giant cruise full of trucks and stuff to an island worse here you just roll\nWell anyway we're watching it for a\nDisaster is my middle name is my boss Tovia Atlanta middle Amos disaster\nWell thank you thank you very much I like to think I Do the job of handling disaster [laughter] ... you know we met causing disasters\nOh [laughter] I just kind of terrible things headline about to that uh I like Andrea ... says\nOh Kimmel show love that bug guy chick ... she was going to be on I wouldn't have watched if I'd known she was I Would have been temporarily not watch is the greatest and here's here's the report here's what they say\nAh how things went Cortez on ... like like for sure like\nYeah yeah like like yeah\nI'm going to be like that's pretty much all she had to say the greatest like\nWhat congressman or whatever uh last time a shower communism is going to be so great I buy shares everything equally nobody's got anything more than anybody else has [laughter] um have you studied that much history happen to believe me I've been told by a Bernie Sanders\nThat it's all good [laughter] yeah\nAnd you and your antenna wisdom love here we are a nation in trouble you people know that right and the other thing is saved us from going over the cliff as I've learned a lot in recent days\nI saw this video and it made all the sense in the world to me after I saw it Trump didn't just happen Trump was chosen to save the world\nBy a handful of the leaders who were sick of the leaders that were taken is down the pipe to world globalism on purpose\nSo this handful of secret leaders is doing battle with the handful of secret leaders they are in the bill the bird group and all\nThat yeah they had to find a guy that was they didn't care it couldn't be influenced by hey play ball will make you a billionaire and finally got it was already a billionaire didn't care\nThey need to play ball need to get the job done\nMakes a great story when you hear it does I knew the video and it makes all the sense in the world because otherwise Trump does it make any sense the fact that he\nDestroyed all the odds the fact that everybody that was a politician hated him a and one did not see him do well he didn't have a friend anywhere and yet he's still on\nWhat we've got plenty of friends in Saudi Arabia because he refuses to punish them\nFor the murder of that glorious member of the press\nTrump defends dictator that's the headline yes\nYou know you don't the only reason they're even ... some sort of\nYou know outrage over this because the guy was a member of the media and he was working for the Washington who's one of her own\nUh other than that and they make Trump look bad they don't care here's the thing I here's what I think maybe\nThis puts me in the insensitive ogre category here's this fat idiot who is from Saudi Arabia he knows that the uh bbs guy or be a mass or whatever the hell his name is the new king you guys going to be ...\nHate his guts always has they've had a long running feud hate his guts doesn't have any use for it he walks into the guy's building yeah it's like it was almost arrogant like can't touch me mom looked up on the usa you can't lay a glove on because there's\nPeople that said no I'm In here so ... you try anything looking at 'til\nWell that would just stupid did was if you've been watching these guys your entire life and you're from there you know they don't care about little problems like I'm hooked up with the U.S and you can't touch me ill touch you and then they'll lie about it Oh yes he was here for a what they came and picked up a\nPrice pack or something [laughter] she feels about this now he left a I I think he went fat away yeah yeah he was here\nNo we didn't see him come out huh I'll be there well what do you got to do [noise] miracle a miracle sometimes the cameras don't work right how do you ...\nAnd that changed my opinion on a few things I Will say to those boys at the south\nOf\nSeoul is ah to me I got to be one good thing that goes with it is no parade\nAnd know Sheila Jackson Lee won't that be nice and no a mayor up there claiming victory about the front of the of the parade float acting like he won the entire thing\nI Can't tell you what position he bad it in a in and out of them are bad and clean up here comes mayor Turner's\nOr you know that it comes to the end of the season the triumphant victory or the world series the unlikely World Series victory last year and then the big\nUh home town parade for the moon folks five hundred thousand people lining the streets in their right up in the front of the folk Sheila Jackson\nLee and the mayor of Houston waving their arms like\nThey just who won the saying victorious as I said you doing up there you didn't have anything to do with this [noise] oh yeah [noise]\nSo anyway there's a the upside of no Sheila Jackson Lee mispronouncing your name calling you out to eat or that that I'd probably win there do you got that going\nFor any more ridiculous ideas but yeah I don't know about the general manager for the phrase ... comes from by the time when radio was king be\nLifter Wilson and jumps\nFrom their diamonds and design traffic center all clear on forty five to call freeway south and Dickenson at six forty six if you're traveling in outside of forty five in North free weights about sixteen minutes from

vote\nPasse about uh [noise]\nDuring a couple of things that might get to show some publicity one way to go would be to give up a kidney\nOr that you don't want to do that there was a like a football\nFan they gave another football fan and kidney and that was like a big national story\nBut what if I became the founder\nThe starter of an all Caucasian\nMardi Gras Indian crew\nWill all be Mardi Gras Indians will all be Caucasians\nWill be even need to take the DNA tests to prove their one one thousand the Indian or not it\nNow that Elizabeth Warren has broken that that a mold\nLike we know now we're all at least one one thousand Indian enough man\nBut Mardi Gras Indians aren't Andy and all anyways you know the black people get it [laughter] but nobody questions that\nIsn't that something nobody ever asking them about excuse me sir you have a a you have to have a DNA test available moving and you are an Indian and that you're not engaging in cultural appropriation married and with your big giant sued on that you've got there\nBy the way speaking of the political correct cultural appropriation crab I ... and we ended up as we got a whole lot of emails between yesterday and

[noise]\nWe were just goofing around\nToday is the anniversary of the donut yeah did you know they're no yeah it was on\nThis day in Nineteen Seventeen pure accident ladies over at the salvation army deep fried the very first Dona during World War one for American troops in France\nWhich is why they call them that do do boys the donut is one hundred and one years old today at NPR are ill equipped here to celebrate I'm sad to say I think I\nKnow what would set off a donut celebration here up guys what\nHappens is there's no re\nNeed to do that do you do you only because it's it's it's a it's a history lesson vets\nRight it's a day it's a big day like Sunday is going to be like the nacho day I think I don't like that I'm\nNot one that just wanna\nStuff my jaws was donuts I'm just thinking about the historic nature of the day is that what it is sure you're just a big history buff loved to teach the kids about the history by the way I wasn't making that up Sunday is international nacho day is it yeah huh\nThey surveyed people while they always do eighty one percent of people said that like nachos\nNow we're getting into trouble with nachos and nachos is one of those things were opinions vary on like for example\nOr nachos spread around the plate with equal amounts of stuff on each nacho and baked ride on there or is it that thing where they pile up a much ado read those in the middle ... and then just pile stuff all over the top of\nYou know when they have it in a pile like they do at a baseball game for example a model the chips I'd say probably forty five fifty percent of the chips don't get anything on them at all nothing you didn't have to drive ... and the same thing\nWhen they have a table when they bring it out for the table are now the skill of eating those piled nachos and they bring you a big pile and and there's meat and there's cheese and there's a hopefully not guacamole like along among ruin it but there's all that there and then you're supposed to like take a chip\nAnd sort of rationing it and make sure something against on every chip yes but if you're a table with other people they just start grabbing stuff\nThey'll take like the chip with four pounds of stuff on it eat that one I said wait a minute that could have been for like several ships that are down in there you could have spread that around a little bit but no you ate it all in one day I'm\nChip people don't know that they either they don't know are they just don't care about rules\nThat's the reason I prefer the uniform nachos flat on a plate like a pizza spread out with just a a good amount of stuff on each one let's make them at home so that that's a yeah I mean you got a lot some restaurants they do the piling oriented in the\n... you know what it is to the ... take it outside to the average Joe who they're paying for the meal it looks like he's getting more bang for his along you bet looks good but like you said eighty percent of that just chips what\nYou should do is just order of nachos for yourself individual and that way you can and nobody touches your bedroom I thought you were not if you\nIf you want one I'll fix it for you this has been my problem along those lines well people think nachos or for everybody if ... if you got to play the nachos in front of you or your strangers will walk mine to get to\nSee hands coming across the table what what what what's going on there you know you touching my nachos\nKind of like when you got fries\nAt all yeah well the one was kind of just sticking up pointing at me it was called at my main public fry no no no I wanted these fry special the world war one thing with the donors reminded\nMe of the exciting LSU news I don't know if we're supposed to tell people do or if they wanted this to be a surprise if they wanted to be a surprise I shouldn't have put in twenty seven places on the Internet is all over the news so\nI don't think it's a surprise number five LSU Tigers gum a charge him out of the total\nThis Saturday Night wearing special uniforms to honor the Nineteen\nEighteen silent season\nDuring World War one can you tell me why they call it the silent season 'cause they didn't play that year because they were all fight and Germans they all went to the war and uh\nThey lost a good number of soldiers\nColorado River is a just a just a roaring and look Grange is one of the places you'll find it winds its way down down to Columbus, Texas I could say just driving through that or from Columbus to le Grange you\nPass the cholera you across the Colorado River five times if that windy and currently thing\nYou know it's more fun enough you learn is to get an canoe and\nShoot the Colorado River right there on your canoe all the way from that whole area yeah yeah a half on is it exactly go under all those five bridges how often you do that I haven't done it but I I'll see you do that you want me to go try\nAnd I think you'd look at a swirling groundwater dodging all those giant tree stuff that is you know every time I even think about it in a canoe on a river I just think that he's got a ...\nI don't think so you ... you can almost feel that arrow shift [noise]\nSaw him a release of the water or a flyover video the release of water out of lake ... white spectacular in Colorado where the power of water is unbelievable it looked like one of those videos from China or somewhere or India\nWhere they have those big old mom soon in the water just a roaring and the rivers is why\nWe had a bit of a monsoon here buddy man it is rough do when you get like over\nThere is a good side to all this and I know it's hard for people to see when they're stuff's getting washed away and their their backyard is gone and maybe they lost a a kid and a third bedroom and the deal but\nDrought is over I mean here at my pray for the drought to be over they did get those crops growing again everything nice\nBarely a lot of you folks up Matt gentle Texas area just damned good prayers yeah boy you know who the hell out of it he rotted and ... we got\nWell I Know we've said this a lot maybe people get tired of hearing us bring it up but I probably get here tired of other people bring it up but us nobody has to say it again yeah\nWhy don't we listen\nTo Rosie O'Donnell more she's got some damn good ideas and if we I think if we just pay more attention to her and we'd all be better off here's one of her latest Rosie O'Donnell says so why she thinks we should use\nThe military to remove\nIf Trump from power we what do you mean we\nAre all of us you know all of us everybody hates stroke so they were in with her shoulder we're we're we're strong essay also gives me\nWhat's even stupid or is she thinks the military is with her\nHas she ever met and I don't really know the metal military uh she ever hung out with a couple of snipers\nOr a couple of navy seals or something and she doesn't whisper this on a a a microphone that was secretly turned on or something\nShe holds the Mike to her mouth and stand in front of people obsessed these words out loud on purpose we should use of the armed forces just overthrown\nRemove him from the White House now this is the kind of thing the reason you didn't do that because that's the kind of thing it used to get your arrested really come arrest somebody that would say something like that she said because that ...\nWhat what exactly are they done lately and overall feeling bad liked him from day one you know ... they wanted to overthrowing the minute he got there I mean he wasn't even they are good wedding package\nBad yet we'll remember one of the good ideas shooting had then we didn't listen\nTo her then either and I I don't know why uh one of her previous suggestions was to impose martial law to delay Trump's inauguration a almost two years ago\nOnce again uh have you met the police and the the the guys that were being posing the martial law they're\nNot on your side either way you can almost\nTo understand why he might not care for her\nUh yeah this bitch ought to be locked up she says that\nNight he won the presidency ah got physically sick and it took a good year to compose herself to be in public again she took a year out of the spotlight because she couldn't handle\nWell I like one one of the things that are upset at his rally last night in Montana and by the way that was in Missoula, Montana that's a good place where thousands of people lined up and Kevin Costner is right in that show Yellowstone\nTwo communities in Montana\nHad been totally ruined by influx of California in ... and those two are Bozeman in Missoula to really cool communities\nJust like when people invade our country from far inland as in California in invaded Montana cause they really loved how beautiful it was and how they got things done and how it operated\nCame in and they turned it into California yeah that's pretty much like a ... percent the local folks don't appreciate it\nToo much the guys again therefore what Montana was law and appreciated Montana for what had had well\nThere's no people here why do you think I'm here I came to get away from you now you're here I\nI I just think we saw it out a lack of people that's the reason I met him on that and so here they go California\nGum all bring you left wing politics and your Rosie O'Donnell out here to the mountains in ruin it\nMaybe we should use the U.S military just guys who are all have a weekend pass to go and remove Rosie O'Donnell from wherever it is whatever she's new in the whenever we
