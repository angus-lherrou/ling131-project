{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "The airline pointed out the rodents including squirrels are not allowed on flights so sorry lady get that thing out of here the passenger was told\nBy the airline policy she refused to leave the plane she actually argued with them\nI'm actually the police were called everybody was forced to be playing the woman was scored it off the white some airlines have cracked down on this whole emotional support thing I think that's probably the right thing to do um I mean in this case this woman wasted two hours of people's time the flight was delayed by two hours because of an emotional support squirrel\n\nDreamer back in January Delta Airlines said it was thoroughly but passengers efforts to fly with various types of animals they said they've had come for Turkey's gliding possum sugar gliders snake spiders\nIn comparison to cats and dogs emotional support support squirrels haven't gotten the same level of acceptance apparently in Florida\nThere was an evicted uh there was a man of enormous condominium because of a squirrel that didn't qualify as an emotional supports pet so this has happened in Puerto before maybe this lady and that guy know each other and then who could forget about my favorite news story the emotional support peacock\nThe emotional support peacock was a real thing this is a real thing it's a real news story but what you're about to hear is not [noise]\n\nThank you for flying you made it are you talking a bag now I'm just going to carry on my suitcase and ...\nJust me my suitcase and my pet peeve no you can't bring onboard the flight itself wild animal [noise] my not with a big deal yeah well for starters\nIt looks like it's freaking out and deaths including all over the floor [noise]\n\nIt appears to be packing the face of the man standing behind you say you're going to have to pay to have that peacocks ship to your destination you can't bring a wild animal that's probably all over the place in attacking other passengers on the plane\nYou don't understand\nThis is my emotional support people\nAnd the snow support peacock that's\nTell you your ticket you and your peak I Kevin nice like well it's everywhere people\n[laughter]\nIt's a very strange time to be alive people when Donald Trump is the voice of common sense then people are flying on planes with emotional support animals oh\nPray for this country we're in we're in rough shape folks it's just a strange time I mean they're even they've done so much lately [laughter] the left they who's on the left has done so much lately to spread ridiculous talking points about\nMultiple genders you know in New York now the the the mayor of the the governor of New York is going to sign a bill soon that'll put gender acts down on birth certificates [laughter] I don't I don't even know where to go with that it's just it's absurd it's absolute ludicrous folks an\nAnyway I'm Glad it's Halloween time because this is one month out of the year when you'll see these jobs in the street and you might just confused them for just your average run into melt trick or treaters\nYou know there's a there's actually a place where they're trying to make trick or treating illegal\nYeah I was surprised by this too I I didn't know what it won't be illegal for every one trick or treaters older than twelve could be arrested in parts of Virginia anyone Thirteen or older who does trick or treating can be sent to jail for up to six months\nNo matter what age do trick or treating ends at eight PM in Virginia and you can be fined somewhere between twenty five and a hundred dollars if you break the rules and I'm curious how could it be illegal to go trick or treating just because you're older\nI mean\nLike I don't think the teenagers in adults should go trick or treating but our I maybe there's exceptions what if somebody is mentally disabled is a I don't know if we can use the word retarded anymore but what if somebody is intellectually challenged and the person happens to be sixteen and they want to go trick or treat him\nBut I'm the only challenge got trick or treat [laughter] I don't even have\nTo fight for this one we should just let that happen right I don't know I mean there's no news story out about it but if somebody did arrest a mentally challenged person for trick or treating I got to assume the Supreme Court would get involved because it sounds like a violation of their First Amendment rights\nOkay All right I went off on a tangent there that's not necessarily what's happening but they did pass a weird one I just had to point that out\nIt's a weird time to be alive there's this video online that surface to this guy beat boxing at at McDonalds she's holding a straw up to his mouth and he sliding it up and down into McDonalds plastic cup and I only bring this up just so I'm an excuse to play the sound bite [laughter]\n\n\n\nI don't know if it sounds as awful lot of ham radios that sounds on YouTube but it's fun to listen to Vermont [laughter]\n[laughter] that's a fun sound but that's just a fun sound mind them in the crowd cheered [noise] I got the whole\nMcDonald's six years you know how hard it is to get people at McDonald's to cheering upon for something\nWell I mean it depends where you are at a mansion in some parts of the country if you just made a really delicious

hour or drinks or something\nBut this woman had a different Wednesday evening about seven o'clock they say in Philadelphia [noise] she got involved in a little bit of a road rage incident thirty three year old woman\nGot another woman kind of mad at her\nAnd so this one woman in the road rage incident went up to the other woman\nAnd started stabbing her in the back I guess that would be mad yeah thirty three year old woman says stabbed wants in the back\nOnto the shoulder and once in the left hand which I'm assuming a defensive wound you put it up play it hey stop ... stop stabbing me manhood timing for uh\nThe assault or here as an off duty Philadelphia police officer saw the stabbing take place the police officer managed to wrestle the knife\nAway from the woman but then the woman hop back in her car and fled the scene now these are some of our northern\nPhilly ladies are getting after each other\nSo they gave chase the ... ended up crashing her car about two miles away\nAnd then of course was a little hesitant to peacefully complied with the officer's requests to exit the vehicle and so uh I I don't know if the window broke during the crash or if they just yank the door but they did in fact\nProbably her out of her car using a you know the fifty thousand volts of the bars of justice which caused her to a definitely hop right out of that seat in into the arms\nOf the law the stabbing victim by the way a listed in stable condition expected to be okay cause they raise them tough in Philly if you hadn't heard the boat and when we tell you\nThat if you commit a crime that might be taser worthy\nConsider this it might also be\nMore than ... are worthy so in other words sometimes considered himself a lucky if you get taste teasing\nIt's considered most of the time as a non lethal weapon as opposed to a an officer service revolver or hand gun or a you know semi automatic on\nOr whatever he happens to be shocking at Bowling Alone you but in Honolulu, Hawaii a man lunge at a police officer with a machete\n... bad enough but when the machine cuts or not you think to yourself\nIf I lunge at this officer with this machete are they going to tell you or me with a non lethal weapon or are they going to think to themselves this guy needs to get shot turn\nOn you know you think you think that's not a\nAnd it's like they were ... it might be going to be\n\nWhen I was on the line and you see a girl the handling knowing or something that\nYou know what I'm supposed to go ...\nPercent one way or we usually end up getting ... ... yeah I'm going to say you can't really notice if you're a guy named ... yeah you're in a way\nAnd they said that the only reason you need to know what I'm supposed\nA ... good smells are called\nAscertain what that is true\nPaying your debt I don't mean stank\nAnd then they show any kind of free mature audience in\nCharlottesville [noise]\n\nWho bang bang\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nA mystery that that really\nAlthough we do have some similarities we both like to talk a lot we both have to sleep at the barn that also I'm surprised by what comes out of your mouth [laughter]\nHello uh\nI just found out\nI just found out that I Am in the same boat with Robert Redford we both woke up and we\nBoth see a country we don't recognize oh I thought you rich woke up and you notice you're just not as ... as she wants war I'm sure Bob did that too yeah\nCause I saw a picture of the other day he's looking a lot like in a whole baseball glove or a wallet are really opened his eyes and then you're like oh here I think he's alive and he was a really good looking guy or the ... but he really a huge ...\nThe most right in and get just to prove how much manly compartment like moisturizers held though me and Chris Chris just saw Christopher ...\nWe're not going to do any moisturizers alright ever since Jeremiah Johnson I think is just too much time outdoors yeah\nHe's got a little\nPlace up on new Utah called Sunday it's a giant\nI I guess you'd call it a ranch slash a bunch of other things and of course that's what they need that film festival after several hundred thousand acres and it's nice for what I understand\nThat you're giving it all the way he is not that that just really hard to understand the socialist that don't want to give me all their stuff they talk about how we should all share share alike but if I go up to the gate of Bob's place if the Sundance does a guard there with a clipboard did you go ahead\nYou're on the west will know that\nAnd social is supposed to be free for all this uh I'm here at the American citizen to just say\nTo show it on every once in a while he'll do something where he does a singer and to show how good he is playing the guitar you know he did not\nNeed to do that there was no need for you didn't sell it he just did it so we could show you that he could\nBest back when they used to have albums and stick a couple on the album now nobody has an album anymore they have releases of groups of songs as they stream down the Internet [noise]\nI guess in many ways that we should be thankful there's no albums anymore they don't buy this they don't make us by their crappy songs or you want the good songs you can just can give my three good ones on if you'd like just the one I give you ten bad when you got to buy all of them together okay well thank you are\nBut yeah\nSo no more of this or you know Brad we don't really have a albums anymore so I don't know what we're going to do with your instrumental tracks nobody seems to be buying them are a lot of them I Know you like to show off once I'm a little bit and they make great bumper music for DJ shows but uh\nOther than that maybe that's why they couldn't do it with a free bumper me anyway anything they can do to hurt us yeah there is a because that's just kind of me vindictive\nMean spirited world that Beto O'Rourke will stop that's what he says he looked at me and that camera and shit I Will go to Washington DC [noise]\nAnd I will represent everyone Republicans and Democrats at the same gusto little Lizzie and Democrats said the same thing I Know that they've told them to all say that in taxes especially\nAnd of course well he'll he'll be okay you work for me too it's really quite hear that because so clever you know the truth of the matter is to go to Washington DC Washington DC is divided it is Democrats ended as Republicans and it was the ruling class against us\nAnd that's just the two clubs within the ruling class see Trump's outside the root causes of reasons both parties have him\n[noise] but um\nAnd we are the deplorable are also hated so yeah he'll go there and he'll do whatever Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tell them to do they're the ones who gave him the money [laughter] the exact advertising\nIs that and George Soros on your own global ... let's just hope\nThey don't get to go there because it's up to you whether they get to go there or not you gotta stop them even if you don't ... even if you think Ted Cruz has like the smirk on his face all the time\nAnd vote for him but not voting for him you're voting against that give you the socialist communist Democratic Party but there was a liar that look into the camera and tell you when I go to Washington\nIt won't be ... I didn't why are you running for particular party and taking their money and taking the money in the world global a sewer\nGeorge Soros war his one would life's work is taking down in the United states of America why we're not upset when we hear that any candidates taking money from him I Do not know\nBut they're more worried that they took money from Larry Flynt or somebody like that well a lot so you know do you pull and muddy [noise]\nUm yeah it's better to take a the global is money and the guy that wants to destroy the country that's way better\nThere was a guy in New York City who was so upset with both sides of the political way that he decided to build a giant bomb in his basement and blow it up I thought you could say arc for us all come together on learning to live together\nTwo hundred pound bomb plan was detonated on Washington's National Mall but he saw would be on election day or a ... beautiful and this was going to change things somehow because his ideology is based on a theory that\nWe randomly select our government officials that his like ah we don't know Democrat Republican we don't know what they think what they would do when they get up there we just ran out of me one of those give me three of those and give me a six those right here is like a guy listen to Hillary Hillary\nSays you can't be civil to people from the other side until they give us at least half the government back we don't have to be we can we have to be violent and the ugly to them because that's what's required\nReally yeah I'm\nYeah because you can't be nice to people whose who have set out to destroy everything you stand for and what I really hate is the quote unquote journalist usually some ... and by the way\n... nothing against chick 'cause I can read chit news people in the history of the world but not not the number we have now I mean they're just every shows got to have two or three out at now are chattering chirping like a bunch of birds on a wire he's in\nMost men don't find that\nSomething good to listen to is because men don't have and it's not a knock it's just that we do things differently process information differently\nWomen have the ability to talk over themselves three or four of them at a time you've seen him at a party at the house or somewhere or out of this at a restaurant three or four women\nCan all talk at the same time and they can all basically hear what the others are saying at the same time as they are talking\nMen do it a little more civilized I hear what they're saying\nBut what they're saying is using nothing I mean it's usually just do it on\nThe the when I hear it\nAnd they say it differently\nWell then left not have these women all over our news shouldn't there be a channel they can watch the chick channel and there'll be all kinds of checks chirping in ... ... and live a long day and then for the serious news we'd go someplace else and get the news\nThis news first and just sitting there listening to this idiot go on about\nThe ... the people that want to destroy everything we stand for a real journalist would have got hold on let Hillary you're ... you're going to political party and there's another one that is diametrically opposed to\nHe wanted to blow himself up uh-huh I guess he was going to straddle it well that shows he likes pull the court shows he means well on proving everything man everything better they did mention that what about you know maybe some of the collateral\nDamage of people walking around on the mall and stuff and\nYeah it just seemed to not upsetting too much\nHe has what they call radical political beliefs kind of like Hillary courses so do I. [laughter] out according to some of them [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah well that's good and then ah\nHe didn't get to do is deal just let you know the kinds of people that are out there walking around among you there Dr among you and they do show up and vote so if I'm the guest political party yeah I'm going Democrat all absolutely a hundred percent guarantees what they call it never ... I didn't care for drop all that much [noise]\nWe got into a person that probably try to keep that out of the news that they often do that when one of these people that they don't all him on our side now they don't need that\nThey will ally or they'll just call it the kind of like this guy that\nRan through the intersection up there in New York with that bus load a limo and they call it but it's more like a busload of people and killed ... people\nTurns out that guy was a kind of Islamic uh-huh I like the Islamic named the whole Allah Akbar kind of\nAh the guy that owns the limo company uh same thing the the rest of the son of the owner the owner himself a magically took off to the middle east [laughter] run around the time the ... and they never imagined\nThat the guy's name or the you know these ... Mohammad Ali ... or whatever\nAnd I was just ... people say the wrong thing they immediately fake some kind of Arab terrorism thing or suicide bomber kind of guy\n'cause there are no skid marks Soto when when the thing in other words it was almost as if like when they flew the planes into the building they met two I got a group of people here uh much uh you know Ken Fidel's\nWhite infidels living it up and that it's time\nFor our law tell them what it's all about\nAnd of course all get in the seventies virgins and having the limo itself\nWasn't fit enough to be driven on the road the driver also a lesson licensed it enough to be driving at these people they are really not\nThey're really not careful about obeying our laws so much more of a suggestion in a law yeah we go by the ... all the laws of law and doing a wall of infidels don't like it even better\nOr law says if you want to run a slip shot limousine service without the proper maintenance and ... rented on the cheap it is the wheel of a law that you do so\nHandy as long as you make a lot of money and the\n[noise] but yeah we're tracking it for you were up our early and a lot of the stuff's going to get by everybody else but not here so no here prices will be paid vengeance will be extracted hey we'll be stopped love will be enjoyed\nMocking the sound of this and I write me up and America will form a giant ring around the rosy circle\nAnd live happily ever after but unless you tell everybody listen to this show [laughter]\n... I have read everything I\n\nPrayed diamonds and design traffic sensor\nWe do have an accent slash vehicle fire on the freeway it's out banished coming up on all the inventor and you're back to west

tumbles out of their mouth about the global warming shut up and you're not supposed to doubt them they've got\nProfessors and people like ... for the outcome I Know there are all around you ... are to blame but not buffalo more the cows dumped the dinosaurs ... before that but now and therefore\nThey loved the coach of that thing about Ninety seven percent of scientists degree and then of course we know that came up with that phony number from phony survey with the phony number of scientists hope you'll remember they quoting\nThis they took the first survey and a bunch of scientists or disagreed with them so they kick those scientists out of the survey then they did the right yet again after they took those out and it turns out then they got a Ninety seven percent approval rate or she got a strain scientists find the ones that bank right exactly as you come back what [laughter]\nYeah so it's uh\nThe guy that invented the weather channel one of the founders of the weather channel who's dead now but on his deathbed\nHe admitted they made up the whole global warming scale as I taxing scheme to make money for municipalities states and governments and score money for a university ... wanted to do studies and get grants\nThat's it it was created as a money maker they thought what a great way to control people get their money and to have this global scare\nThat there's something we can do to stop these changes in the atmosphere if you just give us some money yeah that's ... that's up to\nTheir people running for office today somewhere in this country that are claiming that they must immediately initiate ... story a carbon taxes\nOn the citizens or else we're doing this because there's nobody there like\nMe to ask them questions like what are you going to do about China worry

Obama talk 'cause it'll motivate their face we can't talk about impeachment or to motivate their\nPay him a craft to sidestep the issue of the ... fly hey there could be a renewed investigation that's\nThe thing that's going to think back have an out of the fact that he lied about how he liked to get down in college but I'd like to find out about the bill Clinton got paid\nBy the way [laughter]\nNewt Gingrich has a constitutional scholar whether ... probably one of the more knowledgeable constitutional scholars and it may actually teaches college courses on the constitution just look at the size of that hated oh it's a huge in Iowa or good guys got some brain and there\nAre new to the process of impeachment was put in by our founding fathers and the case of a president or somebody like a Supreme Court person who's there for life\nIn case they did anything wrong the idea was if they do something wrong and we kind of investigative we see if there's grounds for impeachment\nIt was never meant to okay I Want to be rid of this guy so let's go find out if he did something wrong and dig big big deal we find something so we can get him\nOut of there that's not what impeachment was included for and they do something wrong then you move on it you know the Democrats don't care\nWhat the rules for the Democrats just care that they get their way it's very dangerous because after two hundred and some years this is the first step somebody's turned it around backwards and said let's find all the stuff is done wrong so we can get rid of this guy that's not the reason you have impeachment isn't getting rid of people\nIf you have impeachment so you don't have somebody who's there and they've done wrong\nUsually an office not\nWhen they were in high school throwing a chunk guys that somebody had but when they were in office they did wrong\nAnd there has to be a way to get rid of them so they can't you can't get rid of me I'm president you can't get rid of me I'm On the Supreme Court yeah try just try to get rid of and you can't do it because I can do all the wrong I Want that's the reason impeachment was there not\nTo get rid of people want about if we could we impeach one of the Supreme Z or if they ah died but refused to leave the court\nDoes it ah\nGinsburg gal\nI'm pretty sure she died somebody poked or with the ... the other day and she

we talked over the the fifty percent mark yeah the first time people that think that they have seen zombies of course there's no such thing so they have not seen zombies\nGoes to court you're real say they are such things as go so they must be right\nYeah do still real uh we've all seen them of course it's not you felt them you know you get those particular legal things going up on your absolutely\nAnd and you think wow I said ghost who\n... who who\nAre forty percent of us have seen a lot of us think our pet has seen a ghost no dogs actually goes to where they scare\nOff into the room where you don't see nothing and they're looking at it\nLike there's something there man are twice as likely to say they've seen a ghost\nBut I Know you've seen a ghost right oh hey oh yeah yeah probably ... probably ... probably yeah I've seen something ... it might have been a ghost it might have been in the middle of the night\nYou experienced feelings or read in your basement or addict you or any of your family are seen as books vector or go\nTo the answer is yes then don't wait another minute pick up your phone and call the professionals goes fathers are courteous inefficient staffers on call twenty four hours a day just sort of all your supernatural elimination we're reading I spotted\nA spoken by a neighborhood yesterday is that right oh yeah they double nighttime data oh well that's not something to worry about the end it all bad times ... do you have to worry about what about goblins or what\nThe hell ... do you do now on the ... when I\nGet one [laughter] no I ain't got but yeah it's a creature [laughter] other things were scared of snakes for some reason most snakes are really not to be feared\nThat over there is a reason for being scared of stuff oh sure yeah because there's precedent yeah there is a spider's\nA lot of people are scared of spiders 'cause they're just kind of scary even though\nWhat is it like one percent of the spiders are poisonous or can hurt you in any way which\nIt'll scared of it which best you just expect all like snakes ... all of them to be bad you don't want them crawling around on your we fear sharks\nEven though you're\nFar more likely to be hit by lightning than you are to be attacked by a shark because you spend a lot more time on land than in the water you're far more likely be bitten by somebody's dog than you are being bitten by a shark\nOr drowning were afraid of drowning I'm not afraid of drowning and if somebody\nThrows me off the back deck of an ocean liner and I'm Out at sea and what you're not likely to be on and the first\nPlace but a good you know about those I've had my time on those yeah\nA heights I Am afraid I Do have the fear of heights I don't know about the rest you don't go up there yeah that's a good point but it's\nNot a whole heights I I'm okay on an airplane I mean think about it in an airplane but it's like a building the whole thing where you go up to an edge if something\nOr if there's a building where I've got glass windows and I know I Can't fall out I'm not afraid but is that open\nSo you're not afraid of heights you're afraid of falling that's probably true again like snakes and spiders there's a reason for that caused you to kill ya\nLot of people have a a failure of a fear of public speaking\n[noise] still years off and easy clean up\n[noise]\nI'm good\nI'm good [laughter] all\nRight only international sign is the when you stand up parents put both hands over your head like there was a touchdown and that led to the crowd know whether they're foreign or whatever it is that you're okay I'm\nI'm good at it and then usually right after that you collapse they put you in the hospital right after uh yeah [laughter] yeah I'm Glad no matter what your views are new survey found that most of us do agree on one thing constant bickering about politics\nIt's an exhausting eighty seven percent of people said they think that this is the most divided the country has ever been in their lifetime\nSo almost nine out of ten people agree that is the case the good news is most of us think we can get through it\nAnd that's all depends on the Democrats you know they started all this fell seventies got going to have blood on our hands the minute somebody does something to a Republican\nBut you'll be surprised there will be because she encourage the vet act of violence in civility she absolutely did you know what she'll she'll not end up taking credit for it on your until you get in trouble for anything else why would you get in trouble for that now she's actually\nShe's got a a a trail of bodies behind her only fourteen percent\nOf Americans follow the categories of extreme left or right according to them oh nobody's extreme that's the other guy this extreme ha ha there at\nThe ball field when Stevens lease almost died from a very very angry violent man who was inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us\nShooting five people in almost ... this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket that he's willing to kill\nSo what happens when when Democrats say get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence and not even live next door to you you don't know where these people are\nBut what we shouldn't do is incite people to violence and so we've asked Cory Booker attract those words we've asked or the Democrats in general to try to ratchet it down and say look we want peaceful dial way fast he gonna attract [noise]\nWe've heard indirectly from him that he didn't intend to incite violence and I take him at his word on that I don't think his intention is to call people leave out the getting help in someone's face getting up in someone's face really kind of does sound like you want them to get you know nose to nose with them and the problem is is rational people might back down\nWhat's gonna happen when the guy comes with a gun to a rally or comes with a knife to a rally there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nYeah and I think Rand Paul with his soft swat\nValley lamb hair is quite the spokesman\nFor that or just a man to get this ... you must have made those comments before Hillary made hers because he didn't even talk about that but a producer getting the research department here at the Johnson Joe just went out and found\nFive hundred and eighty three media approved acts of violence against conservatives and Republicans name one well the latest one\nEvery four days ago that a teacher tweeted so who's going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh okay I'm I'm just playing like on the left wing guy\nNamed to okay well uh Rand\nPaul's wife says I have to sleep with a loaded gun thanks to the leftist threats made against me\nHalloween though she's not sleeping with a loaded gun because Rand Paul's ... husband yeah he's I mean mean man you just look at it and see the mean it looks like he just he's just an ass Weber from way back then and then when it\nWould accept that guy tackled him off and there's a lot more put him in the hospital yeah so\nThe rice and a and threatening letter sent to Trump to people hospitalized after exposure to powdery substance that the debt cruises Houston campaign office that was a week ago and this just goes back how do you know it was left wing or is doing all this ...\nHow can you prove this Democrat protesters harassing a GOP rep shame on your Mexican wife\nYeah ... ... people ... yeah\nYeah ... yeah right wing or is he accused people\nStuff and you can't even prove it you know how we prove stuff we Democrats we just have one chick\nRecall something from her memory from thirty six years ago and that's all the proof anybody that's exactly right because we believe survivors we believe survivors no matter how little evidence or corroborated\nTestimony to have a at least three separate times a Republican politicians have been run out of restaurants whether is Los Angeles or Washington DC by a bill ... mobs\nI heard that that little ran hand restaurant they were run out of with probably for their own good cook the food\nThe hostile and hostile yeah like you but you said you didn't know how can we take your land and if you didn't own it\nAnd and then you throw a bunch of other Indians off that land and in fact do the same thing we did we did it matter because you\nYou're just talking to a man happened to be a ... didn't you guys used to be like in New Hampshire or somewhere and now you're way the hell out here in North Dakota\nBecause you came out here ran a bunch of other Indians off the land and just took it from them\nAnd\nHe had in there you could just tell it was like a a a yeah that's what I thought oh we've got an email from smart ass sunny a smart ass hey how are they laid on the smartest Sonny says regarding that celebrities survey about\nPolitical opinions aren't you guys celebrities [laughter] no way\nSunny please are you getting were radio where we're not part of the media and we're not celebrities by any means we're barely part of the media were referred\nTo in a by other people in the media as the bastard stepchild of all media\nAnd other things that sets this show and these gentlemen apart from the celebrities who are mouthing off about their political opinions is those celebrities do something else for a living\nAnd then they give their political opinions they sing or they ban so they act or they're in a car to parties and they they do television shows and things for a living and pose for pictures molest various guys don't have anything else right\nIf I could pose for pictures as a living I probably would I I'm not sure he's helping us but um but right yeah that's all we got we don't have anything else we don't really\nI mean I think if I were put into movies I Would win like a dozen Oscars and the first ten years I was in the business oh easy a but nobody puts me in one she put me on a movie stand back waiting for the sparks fly because they're\nThey're scared and jealous of your well that's probably a hills inability\nThat my giant pain is scares awful lot of people\nIt's jealousy quite frankly George you get from these people that here is a elucidate ing are incredibly a\nCrystal and clear opinions on things that are are thought processes\nAnd people are like whoa\nWhen I hear they're like that's like so amazing actually scares them because it's so good that's a lot of what happens and then a lot of things we do on the show like\nThen I tell you I was going to tell you how to turn your ... green you said a some kind of fun colors I didn't know what color you are talking about yeah this just in a few years back\nBurger King sold a burger with a black mine for Halloween\nBut they had to stop doing it because it the black blood return to people's poop green and it scared them\nOr mommy and it turns out they did not learn their lesson Burger King just started selling something called\nThe frozen ... scary black cherry philosophy for Halloween ... scary goals as black cherry yeah all based on reports it's causing poop problems again oh boy well the\nBurger King got used to it with the first scare and and now they brought it back and they're like oh no biggie\n[laughter] they says so far guarding the social media reports these celebrities have turned people's poop black green and blue also\nDrink at your own risk\nBut by the way the covering it has nothing to do with anything being wrong with you is just what\nYou put color in you get cholera I Know I just like when I eat red velvet cake all boy I thought I was dying hunters dot very sure I got cancer from that if it turns out yeah it's just it's a very valid gay it's got die and it looks like we're going to be alright

jeeze besides the Vita is just good old regular American cheese well being an American\nCheese are very similar sales of American cheese are down for the fourth year in a row neither one are technically cheese and the average price is down\nBack at two thousand eleven level just to sell it well that's good news we get a cheaper Melissa get the blame they're moving away from processed foods in American cheese is one of the most processed food products there is\nSomebody dispute this story yesterday in this story came up in the news yesterday and somebody said no no no that's not true but the controversy has not done millennial the they said the only reason that that\nCheese you said when we were young all cheese was crappy\nMe there there was a chief you got here will veto there was the American cheese slices they went and saw an international yeah because he said because if you weren't in the grocery stores and we were kids and Billy Idol back me up on us\nOr they didn't have the cheese section they didn't have the all the foreign cheeses from France and Italy in England in Germany and whole ... dean and stone fries and all these different you know Greek cheese in Mexican cheese and all these\nGenes I didn't know you love a good smoked gouda Buddha doesn't love smoked gouda still is you know\nThey just didn't have I mean you had we had two kinds of cheese you're there at the American cheese all my dad used to call ... cheese which was latch chatter that chatter but that was your rent jeeze goes that that was what you put it in ... and maybe some Swiss to put in your sandwiches with\nThe big holes in it but there wasn't hard choices they said that if it's the proliferation of choices of\nEasily obtainable good cheese French is the reason that ... and good prices from the big supermarkets as a reason that people don't just automatically by the big pack a craft singles anymore slapping their Basque that's why\nBut anyway they want to blame it on in the middle and it was because they don't have a taste for that they say but I think they don't have a taste for it and they don't have to buy if\nYou are a millennial and you don't know what American cheese is it's that bright orange and it is stuffed with preservatives admitted is created in a lab it is not ... it's\nDefinitely not the stuff you get on the nachos at the ballpark because I've not even say gee I don't know what the hell that has some kind of orange sauce that some guy and I don't know what\nThey said the real telling part about that that fake geez I put on the nachos and stuff is if you set that outside\nIt will not get covered in insects that the animals no that's not food flies did not land on your nachos it's like if the melted a Frisbee and then ... over chips you wouldn't you eat that\nWell if it's if you're at a ballgame apparently you\nWill first of all the fact that that stuff comes out of a quarter nozzle Australian everything you need to know about it

shake it more when it gets close to empty yeah kind of blows up on you yeah\nI prefer a cheese that as dug out with a knife or some kind of a ... a vat or tub of some kind if you run out of crackers and trip chips you can just tip your head back\nAnd she just like whipped cream just pop it right in your mouth may I tell ya it still seen as Bob ... because we're of that generation I'm Still a

then uh also put some a little slices jalapeno in there to melt lead an arrow tell\nShould be sold next to each other in the grocery store we've said that for years they are becoming groceries some grocery stores are finally getting around to it after we made the suggestion but for years you had to go find the movie and then go to the ... section and find the tomatoes\nJust tells you everything you need to know about Velveeta and a lot of the areas where they put the retail tomatoes and develop either together\nThe Velveeta is not refrigerated not that you read that packet it doesn't have to
