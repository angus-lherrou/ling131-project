{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Well there it is yeah so that time of year again a strange political news today there's a woman in Wyoming named Deborah Reno\nAnd apparently she's got to drop out of the city council re she's a politician there because it turns out she was posting strip tease videos online and she was selling used under where there's a big market for that some people want to buy women's used underwear and I guess she was doing that and it's like our site also\nI think I'd ... where we also talked when I decided to run for city council about possible ramifications if that were discovered by the community my preference like being in that that wouldn't have come out and Nathan is did you make hundreds of dollars off the south and [noise]\nI make perspective on my I mean I guess a cat famous basketball that's really the wrong word perspective [laughter]\nHey no judgment here lady at your life you do what you want to do she's a city council candidate in Evanston, Wyoming and now there's some blowback after community members discovered what she thought it was a secret identity\nOr name is candidate her name is Deborah Reno but I guess are professional name was ... mystique rocket\nAnd while she works as a massage therapist as a yoga instructor and yoga instructor her side also involves strip teasing videos and an on line storefront that catered to used panty buyers are she also saw dirty gym shorts for twenty bucks um plus shipping and handling\nMe you know\nIf that's what turned John that's fine but I I I don't know what it is something about used underwear kind of grosses me out I mean I just\nI hate to get all I I hate to even go you're on the radio but you know there's more to used underwear than just your your sex organs there's you know people\nYou know you don't number one and number two down there too right so that's all something that the particles which could have ended up on your I I'm getting to the specifics or I don't mean to do that my only point is it's not high Jenike [laughter]\nBut hey it's your life people it's your life none of my business I'm\nAll right so this woman is facing off against a challenger named McHale wailing for a city council seat in November the winner was supposed to replace Wendy's Schuler Schiller said she shocked and surprised and disappointed to learn about the news um\nIt's unfortunate Reno on the other hand the woman who was accused of doing this she said the venture started off as an interesting experience\nBut now she sees it as more of an error in judgment that it's overshadowing her service to the community\nShe received the second highest number of votes in the primary featuring five candidates so she didn't have a shot at winning but now she probably won't be she claims she deleted all the accounts associated with her racier identity um\nShe says I it doesn't change the nature of who I Am when people know your deepest darkest secrets they tend to look at your quite differently yeah to give a new candidate said she isn't sure if she'll stay in the race now that this is out there if she drops out I'm thinner than than her opponent gets the seat so that'll be that right Evanston\nIs a city with fewer than Thirteen thousand people it's a very small place in Wyoming it's about eighty eighty miles north east of Salt Lake city so chances are you've probably never been there\nUm\nReno's opponent as a full statement here I was made aware of this late yesterday afternoon and think this is very unfortunate and so against my moral code and standards I have not yet confirmed nor do I plan on confirming\nThese allegations against my opponent I Am going to continue to focus on the issue as well and that's probably the right thing to do because I mean let's face it\nUm if people don't want to vote for this woman for this reason that's their choice it's their choice not to do that if she drops out hey that's unfortunate but I think at the end of the day\nThis probably sheds light on to her personal life but she just didn't want to have exposed in the first place and there's a whole bunch of euphemisms there you can you can put part or all the things I just said and have fun with them if you want to I I wasn't even I wasn't even trying to go there it just kind of unintentionally Abbott\nAnyway and other news something very bizarre at a New Mexico today a registered sex offender in Albuquerque New Mexico was planning to make his place in his house into a haunted house\nOpen to the public what turns out it wasn't actually him it was his roommate but the people at his neighborhood found out and they are furious\nBecause roommate was actually the one planning and decided to cancel after the local news showed up and said Hi why is a registered sex offender having a haunted house\nI imagine so I mean this is Dana ... says his holiday love and he's so I decided to run on a house there's nothing in the rules and regulations that says it can be held there\nHey we we saw you took that signed on for just wondering why you took it down well I don't want to play with the one doing okay you're you're the roommates yeah your Randy\nService or are you where you can ... I yeah 'cause I don't want people to think of us like that so that happened a long time ago for him\nYeah probably the right thing to do I mean look at the end of the day the weirdest thing about this isn't even the fact that they had a haunted house it's that your roommate has a sex offender and you wanted to have a haunted house\nI think the real takeaway here is that your roommates a sex offender and I don't want to jump to judge when you're I don't actually know the details about why this guy was a sex offender you know at the end of the day you could become a sex offender for a variety of reasons some of them very disgusting some of them really just up a port case a judgment\nHappening in a ... like you know there's these stories about twenty two year olds who had a Seventeen year old girlfriend and while I don't agree with that I don't think that a person deserves to be on the same list of people who say I'm you know raped a child you know what I mean as a big difference between those two things um\nBut in this particular case and why was this guy a sex offender in the news story doesn't say I I guess we'll never know nope never mind here it is at the bottom of the article ah the man\nWho lives there is a registered sex offender who was once sentenced to more than seven years in prison okay that is kind of serious an online court record shows he pleaded guilty in Nineteen Ninety six to to comes to criminal sexual penetration to conflict criminal sexual contact with a minor in one count of criminal sexual exploitation\nOf a minor All right so I take back everything I said that was just creepy at the end of the day it's just really really really creepy and you know what bothers me about creepy new stories\nI hate when I Am the news I hate when I on the show in a creepy news story so I'm going to end the show on a nice note I like I like giving guys good news before the show ends well back in twenty twelve there was this woman in Pittsburgh who started a charity\nCalled Beverley birthdays where they throw birthday parties for homeless kids and just over six years they have thrown thirty thousand birthday parties for poor children the founders Megan union she explains why they do it\nFor the party and I think today not about that Dr Ballard near me that we're creating for so many of these children had the opportunity for that when you have high and then the fact that I have to look back\nOn the first day and have mom their mom knows that they're able to create got experience how\nHard they that's right because I think in my op people really need to get rid of the dark I\nDon't mean a lot of joy and converting knowing that there are people out there and he sang only care about other people and I mean we're not here to help others what what are you for\nYeah exactly that's really awesome if\nYou're a person like Meghan you and I I got nothing but respect for ya we need more people in this world like that\nAnyway I'm Ken left your junior this has been pursued happiness radio you know you can now hearing me twice a day on this radio station early in the morning before ...

I don't jump out of planes but one thing I Do real well\nIs I Move convoys of trucks down roads through hostile territory where they never wanted me to go you know I ... and he said believe me I Am ready for hostile territory they want to block my path down here I got Thirty years ago and went to nobody wants to ...\nHere's the thing they only do it in these lefty places like Portland, Oregon where everybody's a\nPlay at Patty cake [laughter] he says just trust me I'll take six of them out with my first step out of the vehicle how about that\nAnd remember the police like in Portland, Oregon are standing by to only arrest those who mess with them they're going to\nBe allowed the F with everybody what really stood out about this bunch of emails this guy sent was at one point he then wrote I just realized I'm responding to the ap [laughter]\nHe was listening to the app and he was sending us all the emails thinking or are you getting is or or I'm not that we were ... and going back and forth and then it real after about two dozen emails he realized that okay this was recorded earlier in the he was having an argument with a ... with a date\nIt's so good it's so real that that's what it's like that that that's why it works so good nest reason is the number one\nThe number one play back show in America a man called to my latest poll you asked around it's like a half a dozen people within earshot yeah what's your favorite show on record it out yeah pretty much all of them said this was a good good ball you know yeah yeah I mean uh\nI Know when to quit if I'd asked ten people we might start getting some negative or a bar and yeah but I and I'm Batman probably ought to stop their step off we got a big if we had great polled they're good to Portland mayor dead wheel or is it the decision ... around and watch the\nProtesters and it does by the way those are protesters are called rioters\nA yeah that's not a peaceful lawful protest they weren't peaceful\nAnd they didn't have a what do you call permanent guys wearing\nA mask over their face wielding aluminum baseball bats also other weapons\nAnd throwing ... an eighties running throwing bottles and bricks at people running roughshod the city that is not a protest that is chaos centers rioting\nBy the way one of the ways they get away with that is they make signs\nAnd they attach their little you know poster board sign to a baseball bat so that it looks like a steak and it's you know they just carrying it around holding up the line and then the care of the sign off of it and it's because I've been in the midst of the weapons they attack\nYou or your car Soros tight lately that all of the plan\nLook up and then this weird cat ads now I remember we also video people's cars being baseball bat and\nI wouldn't care an old man being chased down or they didn't kill him or anything but they uh they rushed him up a little bit and chased him down and\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWhen I was enjoying it on my book that's almost never going to be over ... over so anxious to get back on the radio ... like a deadly timber rattler ready to deliver\nMy ... my energy is\nMechanic energy built up like a spring winter to spring forward it's even funnier if you really do is we'll all of them are barely dropped my ass off\nThank God for elevators oh well you're still be in the lobby going by the stairs five floors below I probably your cars five floors that two sets of stairs for each watched four to six yeah that you haven't been around there that's a good ... I probably still be about halfway up just\nTaken a raft between different floors tell you what if you want your stuff that you could there's a little\nProject we could get hired him like\nI haven't looked at any news about Eighteen hours and pretend like I've been you know doing something else and away from the whole news business there were trapped\nIn a cage fire cave in mind that we're in my case then I have no idea what's been happening and three days\nYeah you just got out for the mind Katyn and you just wonder can you fill me in my in my school was the ... the vessel so just\nThe knowledge or read about this if you're one of those has been making fun of Elizabeth Warren folk hot off our president goals are and you can't do that anymore because by God she straightened that match she hired her own private DNA guy\nNot just the standard is like the guys are on these TV shows took a DNA test to see what percentage a might be good at some point and they did it publicly where they do it right there but the DNA and they get their little test back\nAll open it up and solitaire results were like Christmas what are we\nYou may be literally accomplishment but they'll point a finger at somebody like New Orleans go when can you say you had your last shooting for a weekend huh\nNo I don't mean dragon the dead bodies across the Jefferson Parish line in the middle of it I like you are you as always didn't claim\nNo shootings over here are they had a few and Jefferson Paris last night I Know for a fact there's a couple of dead bodies just crossed the line and the weeds\nBack in the day they used to the cops used a dumped those bodies out\nAnd I edited Barry yeah you can buy these night just unloading the trunk and ... slapped their heads together go as Harry leaf problem now it's right Harry tried to catch him for years he'd go out and act like you shoot nutri all night but what he was really doing was looking for New Orleans cop dumped problems over the county or the parish allied\nOh they were very careful about when and how they did it but anyway in New York City pretty guinea and where's that cargo on that list of the year in a\nHurry three weekends ... they haven't had one and so long we don't know well they may not even have that that may not even be recorded\nAs far as history goes when they had to last shooting for a weekend\nThey were kind of always a little thicker than New York city anyway especially in recent years but uh I still take away from the glory of New York city or just pretty excited about this oh here's something we're all going to be excited about the federal government\nDespite the fact that there are always having this well we got a deficit and we can't pay for everything who's going to pay for the Medicare who's going to pay for this who's going to pay for Social Security we don't know who's going to pay for the roads and all these bridges that are followed that for the third year in a row\nStates of America is collected more income taxes than any year previously whole right twenty eight ... is our record and the amount of money collected from the American people and yet they're still falling short paying for all this stuff then that tell you\nAny kind of inkling that they're buying too much stuff [laughter]\nLike a wife or their credit card or somebody needs to either put more money and are stopped taking so much out now we put more money in ever and one of the things that Democrats are running on you this next election this uh mid term election\nRaising taxes will so everything will be free the rich are not paying their fair share yeah we went all over that yesterday\nIt's due to throw in beer on him he'd done something I Want to be black gamble with a with a club what a fee to poke their lives that are thrown out of a thing of accidents varies yeah hey\nThe you know it's like you take your glove to the baseball man maybe you take your your acid or to the football game that I haven't got could run right up to me I'd want to be sure near the border to space always they suing the team or so and the individual individual\nGood soon as I saw yep whose ass off and\nWhy don't we possess I'm pretty sure tire recon taken I Know he probably thought to himself after he ran back to the sideline I should have drug that guy over that wall and just put this film it upside of his hands wisely he didn't 'cause he would be the one in trouble not the gathering the everybody feel better you know 'cause now yeah\nYou're spending every waking moment thinking you know what I should have to share with that I Know what I how many of us\nHave gotten away from a situation similar to this and then you where you live and what I should or should a little mutt that you would if he wasn't so big I invited actor at least twenty or thirty incidents across a lifespan earlier where you would have done it\nDifferently but you didn't well if that's his deal\nThat they've identified the fan on the camera and I know who he is and so it'll be up to the lawyers and that sort of thing speaking\nOf lawyers I Love them and they are the best lawyer so excited about this uh the the hooker that they're\nAt and of course porn star glad you didn't name the hook hookers lash porn star who's been running around are taking her top off anywhere scanned getting sick of hearing that name I don't want to hear it anymore\nShe had a lawsuit against Trump and they finally ruled they should Trump has a ... I don't know if he's innocent or guilty they should know merit to the lawsuit anyway that through the lawsuit out from this a whore and they said now\nShe is responsible for his legal fees which I don't know if you get the historic\nValue of that but President Trump is now the only person on the planet that we know of to get a refund from home for that is a huge theme park yeah when when he says Horace\nDon't give refunds you do you do it and he's doing things ... your ... ... it's really just ... ...\nWinning yeah he's getting money back\n... things he does promises he comes through west no other president\nComes through with campaign promise not even one Trump's dumped to own a bunch of them and he still work and it's only been two years he's still working\nOn it meant and another landmark\nOr refund from a whore there is a huge that's probably going to be one of his single greatest achievements when this the Gulf when he rides his book cash or it's going to be [laughter] you remember that time I got a refund from a horror nobody nobody does the enemy at least one whole chapter right there and that worked at\nUp so they are since that's done now can we stop ever hearing that name\nAs there are so up until of course the name comes back to the news on the day that she writes them that ... I think they should cover that\nI think that'll be the same day or a frosty sensations coming out of the\n... of hell [laughter] I don't think she is ever going to write the check is something to sit back and wait\nFor her attorney is that uh you know do what they what they call the sleazy a porn attorney\nHa ha yeah I Wonder was he a sleazy born attorney before he became her attorney or is that does what he is now a while you always a sleazy porn or trying to think he was always a sleazy\nPoured attorney we'd just now we just now out in the ... attorney meanwhile\nThat dude that had all that money up in northeast from a a computer stuff died and he still had all that money just laying around yeah well this is Paul\nPaul Allen ... co founder of Microsoft yeah that's the ... had had him some of that are non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nIs fifty six years or sixty sixty six years old sixty five\nAnyway that really adult for a rich guy and all that money and apparently it didn't even helped save his life or nothing\nNo he he took the treatments and whatnot but as most people with cancer and modern day he died of cancer treatments and not cancer but he is\nGone the real story is nothing he had all that money nothing do you think that he's out I Know he probably lived a pretty good but do you think that he lived as good as he could have and that red\nAs he was die and he said well thank God I I didn't have anything left to do that because if you got all that money in the bank and I you know it doesn't have to be billions do checks in the bucket last last uh you've probably ought to be spending some of it on yourself every now and then goes into you ain't getting out of there alive you learn I get on him as he did pretty good\nHe built that museum up there 'cause he was always kind of a musician and they said it's better than the rock and Roll Hall of fame his museum he also owns the Seahawks\nYou also owns a another team up there as he's the one that the bought the team from the ... the white guy with the young girls ... ... ...\nThey said the commissioner of football I'm not going to mention his name you know who the bastard is said that\nPaul Allen is personally responsible for keeping professional football in the Pacific northwest\nBecause they the last guy I really wanted to leave and let's get an ally and only\nPaul Allen stepping up and throw in a whole bunch of money at it\nKept the Seahawks from leaving town he was sixty five and a a a cofounder Seahawks owner now do you think gates is going to go to a funeral Bill Gates said nice things that that doesn't happen every day at a friend\nA partner you said a man who uh without him\nPersonal computing wouldn't even exist today Paul and I'm all kinds of credit a net worth according to Forbes\nWas uh twenty billion with a B that seems to me kind of like you noticed he knew he was sick he knew we didn't have long it would have been suite of him before he checks out to at least write a couple of checks\nTo some well deserving morning show entertain a couple of guys that are fans obvious than the big big supporters yet\nUh nothing unless and I've got to hold it against it no they haven't read the wheel yet and it's a surprise and unless he somehow in bed with Hillary Clinton and she sees our name on there and has stricken that could happen just\nNow that all that much money and go to the Clinton Foundation\nCould probably do leave money yeah that'd be sad that would be sad but I I tell you what people up in that part of the country they're just natural their\nNatural ... they just something wrong with them as in the water they eat up with it\nI I think if if you or I moved there it's kind of like a Madonna move with the English speaking with an English accent probably be about six months before we'd be walking around going well I'll tell you what I'm voting for Elizabeth Warren well I don't see that happening I hear she's a Native American\nI'm a man he is a\nWay to work\n[noise]\n\n[laughter] oh man\nThat's what she's therefore by the way if they don't have what you need in stock Billy stagnant can custom designed something just for you gifts from a core you're also nice when you're giving them to people who are mad at you it's hard to be mad at someone who just gave you a gift from a Corey diamonds and design but hey don't take my word for it head on\nInto a quarry today or shop online at a C.

Mississippi\nI Know you don't know right where that is oh yeah yeah ... to the human pony release a report\nOr officers were requested to come over to the pit stop convenience store on highway ... missile Sunday right around noon and I did you know cause trouble to pick up the saints weren't own and she was looking for something else to keep her busy I asked him on\nThat'd be Victoria by the way ms stopping for pickles ... or something she climbed up on the roof of the building\nA report said she was yelling obscenity stew of I I just customers until the cops got there and then she focused uh obscenities mostly towards the ... on the roof build up around the room for the bad stop and they told her to get down\nYeah you know as a kind of what they were saying that really free done by though yeah get out but that route and she refused to come down\nAfter several request I mean the kind of insisted that point you you need to get out here now while on the roof Victoria also was grabbing onto the power lines that were attached to the building in terms of like a Victoria do any of that it was\nThey say an obvious attempt to try and shock herself but it wasn't working because you know I mean as much as you hear about don't touch those line yeah you you really got to have an open ended on whatever hobby well into like bad inflation to shock you show it she wasn't shocking herself\nShe was looking for a spectacular ending the story of some ... after\nThey concluded that she was not going to obey their commands to come down the officers went up and that she's a little off they climbed up onto the roof of the building and they kinda you know hurting her\nInto a safe location where she was away from the age that gas because they knew what they were about to be was closed at this time she was so badly that they basically thought to myself well if she was trying to shock herself with the power lines that this is going to be like nothing\nAnd that's when they whipped up a stun gun and taste or with fifty thousand votes put her on the ground well on the roof you know later low\nAnd then they brought the ladder truck in front of the fire department to lower her still jittery body down from the roof transported or over to the highland community hospital for treatment due to what they called suicidal tendencies any pictures of this uh somewhere I'm not a news story\nYeah bad you'd think well happy ending\nGood story to tell you to report lives on go on with our day everything came out All right knee and well a couple of hours later Victoria fled the hospital with the ... say you lean lock still attached to her arm you know they put it in the back and I hand him are still got the sailing drip\nThe rubber real basket thing she took the whole thing and the two and a needle in her ... she ran to the waffle house\nA balance you really needed to walk up early she had already been told previously never to come back here oh so she had already been kicked out of the lawful house yeah they know her well over there but they don't normally see her running in their attached to a hospital equipment\nLeah cops didn't have to look too hard\nOr does she get a little sympathy playing somebody there are free stack you know I think she's got that I'd be hanging off\nBy the time when they arrested her for trespassing at the waffle house and you know running off with hospital equipment they remove the sailing needle from her arm and gave it back to the hospital where they took it and somebody else like this and this time they took her straight to the J\nUpstate New York or something or can't oh Missouri until All right well anyway the show me she said you know I've got a lot of these people out there with a you know guns and they they want to shoot people and stuff but and of course I'm all for getting rid of all kinds of guns but I Can't really tell you the Republican I have\nLike a or B in a a moderate to act like I'm OK with the guns

person and I thought to myself when he introduced the second now here's the you know so it wasn't\nA topic and I thought you know he just died recently ... recent last year and I thought to myself you know if it would have seemed more appropriate if he had said from the late\n... great\nBut then I realized they never do that if they play a song from elders now the example and you know 'cause I guess you know James Brown they've been dead a longer time James where he seems like there's a a timeframe where people might not know that he died they might have missed it with all the other news going on in the world and\nSay things you know till it gets some people were pretty sure did that aren't oh there's that too yeah like a well until\nYesterday we thought that mean Mexican guy was dead\nBut there was a rumor is on the Internet Danny ... mean Mexican guitar to a guy had gone under\n... somebody I don't know who does that gets a thrill\nOut of starting these death hoaxes on the Internet I Do get if somebody does and then it spreads and they go oh I'm so proud of myself look how far the fake news spread\nOn this day in history two hundred and twenty five years ago today let

out of the oven when they bake\nBread yeah why aren't they gathering up those crowds you know it's like let them let them use crumbs the hundred and two years ago today Margaret Sanger\nOpened the first birth control clinic in New York City uh-huh I've never understood why\nIt's pretty much death control Liz what it should be called right why black people will walk around with a Planned Parenthood T shirt on defending abortion rights when one of the big ... saying where's the day of a well founded that organization to quote\nPerfect the proliferation of the lower races for those of you don't get that uh to encourage black women\nTo kill their unborn babies all day long you don't need any more black people being born basically what Margaret Sanger was was what they call you a gymnast\nBy the way big fan of Margaret Sanger\nAdolf Hitler thought she was ... as a matter of fact he wanted to meet with her and her have her help with his plan how 'bout that his super race plant yeah 'cause they were working right around the same time Nineteen Fifteen Adolf was getting going strong in the Nineteen twenties couple of admirers of each other's work\nForty two years ago today

again getting right close to say and\nSometimes we get up in the morning\nWe'll we'll see we'll\nWe'll send in jumps in radio network where [noise]\nWall Street traded just began to build it opened up the taxes\nWe just started making money hand over fist with are incredible investment strategy does right on the bus sulfide\nPortfolio just rain and casual while to jump out of a little bit of sarcasm there just to salt whereas if you check the if it went up and not good yeah we in the green ... percent already going out to block\nOne percent a leap out of all ...\nUh so yeah that's good that's good yesterday when there was up most of the day I didn't notice it went down after the Saudis admitted to killing that do\nGo they say well that's going to cause some problems with the price of oil and I had an accident when he accidently of course I mean I Would never you know it ... to torture and murder of man you know but sometimes things get a little out of control\nWhile you know the prince or the king and the king of the press or two guys are talking to their most of them said they knew nothing about\nUh the king says yes and now these cases or somebody was trying to impress me and I know a kind of wanted some information out of that guy so they went without my permission started torturing him getting all the information and stuff and then who's\nA previous medical condition yeah bubbly is what killed him because he didn't take care of and\nIt was a town on the job that you are the ones we hook those electrodes up [laughter] probably stopped his heart or

or five hours a night\nWould perform tasks like their brains were nine years older but\nSo the same effect on people sleep over ten hours a night\nThey lose the same thing\nSo you got to see just the right amount not too much not enough not good not too much any the Goldilocks syndrome yeah interest enough [noise]\nI Know you'll enjoy this little story I remembered Taylor Swift went off last week and jumped into the uh being part of Hollywood\nYeah she uh she thought we really needed her opinion on law this information\nTaylor mentioned her favorite politician 'cause she's from Tennessee is a Tennessee former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen\nHe's running against a missed Blackburn for the Senate over there and trying to\nGet him a spot in the Senate seat [noise] Taylor Swift favorite politician just opened up and said in his mind and his belief\nThat white\nMale gun nuts are the biggest terrorist threats on planet earth\nBy the way if you think you're not a gun nut and this guy's opinion if you have a semi automatic weapon of any kind your gun nut you if you have more than one rifle your gun nut\nIf you have a pistol is any guide your gun nut to those kinda guys\nEverybody's a

is the communications director for something called Tennessee victory twenty Eighteen and they're backing a governor former governor reasons run against Marsha Blackburn for the Senate\nBy the way
