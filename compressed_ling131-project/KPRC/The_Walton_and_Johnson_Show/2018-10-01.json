whether I'm here and the truth [laughter] there's very little truth on the news anymore yesterday\nThey said because it's the beginning of the flu season again this year\nThey set an estimated eighty thousand Americans died of flu last winter that's the highest death toll in the last four decades\nNow if you want to get political about an Obama was not mentioned even though he was kind of the president the onset of the last flu season then lapsed into Trump's first year anyway [noise]\nEighty thousand people died from the flu they say\nDo you know anybody that died from the flu no I don't know anybody that died from the flu I'm guessing nobody here knows anybody that died from the flu now you would think if eighty thousand Americans just fell out and ride from the\nSome of us would no one\nYeah and I don't even know anybody that got really sick quite a few people died from the flu vaccine well yeah they don't want to talk about that quite a few people got sick for the ... and then they discovered\nThat the flu vaccine was off and it didn't cover you for like two thirds of the flus that are out there huh [laughter] so the shot was kind of useless\nIt only covered for one third of the flu that were available for you to get well I did some looking in this because it concerns me a great deal that's a large number eighty thousand\nAnd then I found out what that is is an estimate the number of people that died in ...\nBut he'd go after the hurricane that Trump was responsible they blew up for three hundred thousand overnight did it was an estimate in recent years the actual flu related deaths have ranged from about twelve thousand to maybe the high end of you know fifty fifty five thousand\nEighty just somebody trying to start trouble there\nAre probably somebody from the company it makes the food that's yeah that's it they start the story this troubling news and then they sell you it was a vaccine press release some black so welcoming or somebody [laughter]\nYes did you hear that that's it is I Know I didn't hear that\nI Would like to hear from the audience if any of you know of anybody that died from the flu last year\nAnd I mean really the

or inspirational\nWell you know the rest of us don't\nOften inspirational about this a lie and cheat and steal incremental murdering criminal\nThe bigger issue and bigger cover up in all of this I still say is that they're so scared\nBecause they lost in the presidential election Democrats are so scared that we're going to find out all the promises that were made when Hillary surely when [laughter]\nAnd that they didn't even really cover themselves that well and now they're hanging out in the when it was in the bag and they're covering their ass because of the promises made that they would do for people and for things to all the corruption that went on behind\nThe scenes well it'll all get covered up because Hillary were when we don't have to worry all the government tax dollars in government people that were used to help her the bribes or the stealing or vi CIA guys that were all in on it they're they're keeping all\nThese other investigations going on all of this hate for Trump all of that is this huge smokescreen biggest cover up of all time because they don't want us looking behind the scenes and seeing what really took place that face to the whole thing is\nTrump is just\nA canary in the mine shaft of the problem he's a regular guy and not that I'm seeing a billionaire as a regular guy\nBut you listen to him talk he doesn't know how to speak politic ease he he doesn't know how to act the way the politicians at ease\nIn many ways a billionaire who is a regular Joe like the rest of us\nBut if you let the citizens get away with this having elected a guy who's not in the political club you know what do they might do it again\nWas kind of like yeah I mean he showed the way we do not want that so we've got a crap all over this one to make sure you people don't let it happen again\nAnd we we we can Waco and going again John void will be running for president we could do worse remember Ronald Reagan was an actor and he was afraid damn good\nPresident [laughter] just found out this morning just a couple of minutes ago that Marty baling of Jeff starship and Jefferson Airplane died last week yeah\nVery few people will bring him up much can name anybody but grace slick part Jefferson Airplane it's kind of Jim Morrison and the door so who were the other doors well there is a\nA re guy or something [laughter] there's other people in these bands that were part of it\nBesides who I was told I was supposed to like back in high school days ... Seventeen Eighteen years old when they were in their heyday Jefferson Starship was one of the first concert went to and I just remember the name Marty bail and watching him\nFamous Jefferson Airplane they decided to name because we're in the starship beige now not the ... airplane age but they started early and it was airplane hey Julia first started they just said well hey wait a minute what if what you're updated the name everybody what he\nHe was only Seventy six than say here so it must have been some disease would ... would he died from but yeah\nI was like yesterday during one of the football games they're talking about some camera guy that had just passed and had been won all these Emmys and as we're doing football coverage and\nRun into football coverage camera crew and that kind of thing it was like fifty five and thinking okay well something's wrong with that guy that wasn't just they didn't wake up situation something a light switch went off on this guy up some ... some sort of disease but they didn't get into that they just kind of like\n'cause that was Jim Nance and he's very classic yes he is if he's got the classy approached everything that Tony Romo was broadcast buddy that make a pretty good a painter between the two of them [noise]\n'cause uh every once in awhile Nance calls him on some stuff and Tony's kind of fell for facing a foot shovel it and go yeah All right yeah busted\nMe I don't watch the whole family recovering but as I was watching a nap or likes that but the the old quarterback on the spot here well off later you're calling a situation like this\nAnd twice Tony Romo said well I'm going to go to much stronger over here they're you know the one time he was like I'm going to go rent a movie circles the guy on the left the receiver on the opposite of I mean the quarterback never took his eye off that guy in through for the first down got it knows the game he's like yeah there is\nRight there just the way you drew it up it was talking about how Drew Brees operates\nAnd he said what he does the same thing I used to do they sit on the he does it slightly better [laughter] you said a ... they asked him yesterday a little panels show because he visited the panel show before he went after the broadcast booth due to the game\nAnd uh they said well you know do you think you could still play you know if I Know Jerry Jones is the cowboys are struggling like Jerry Jones guns and says two years just give me two years come back we'll be sixty million dollars for two years do you do it and\nYou said I think I could I think I could\nGo to do it as well as I Want to do it\nNo probably not so I'm\nProbably not going to it's probably best not to go back to his reminded me they Drew Brees as a year older than he Drew Brees was a year older than you know he's still out there that you said Tom Brady still out there is that I Know I Know [noise]\nHe said but I'm happy in here [laughter] I'm happy doing what I'm doing nobody hitting me nobody had a making pretty good money and joined the work real well probably tell you\nIf I just whispered to Drew Brees ice it isn't here quit mid season then just come out and\nIt sounds too I'm doing the saints fan to favor I'm not going to mention to them how great this job is just because it's just that ... what a struggle for the faint yesterday oh they're not used kicking field goals when they get down there drew usually takes ammonia and well that was that that's pretty that's\nPretty good defense and then you got to give it to them and of course the saints defense ain't that great but they played better than normal played and that's probably the reason they want a but what was really weird was how the Texans backed into that victory they didn't win\nThe build up the Indianapolis law allowed them to win the game that was a ... that was a huge decision that that go for it I think what they said wait a minute if they go for it you\nKnow and he's about ten yards they'll go rage but he knows that and he's not backing off of it the whole team says well you know ... and they said you don't play the tie\nYou might as well hang a loss up as a tie yeah so they're not they're not backing off of his decision so that was a big Houston victory and that was a big guy Indianapolis last year they still have really want a game they just didn't lose that one at home\nYeah lock it in rip it off the job that is we'll be right back with much more what you bought our radio for\nInsider news the man who held the Guinness world record for most drugs ever done by a

Houston powder yeah re finishes patio French or an ornamental aren't pieces but I thought they were in industrial coder they are but you see in Houston\nJim is when ... ... in the second half and he drew twice as many interceptions this fits tragic did in the first at\nIts I seldom ever hear a admission like that from below Brian even though it's true that's very true he's got some of the most talented football players in the league on his team and I really get sick and I don't know who the announcers then I gained more for Houston\nBut I really really really get sick of hearing about the ... the great Romeo Cornel God or because he's black and he's fat and so we're constantly hearing oh my God the great the great mind the great ... I I thought\nOh I see is the guy that can never ... always left the team but they need to first now they're going to get it if they needed touchdown they're going to get it it's like how is that great [laughter]\nThe guy's not exactly put up a brick wall here and he's got some of the finest defense talent in the league\nIf another coach at defensive might have a weight Phillips\nHad the the defensive line my God that that they've got Romeo ... yeah but the ... Marshall is the talent available to him what could they be doing like a dominate oh yeah\nI used to by the way during that Tampa Bay game when ... tragic and crab legs are we're doubling over I'm\nMitch trip is the second year guy uh just just barely out of his rookie season they're\nYoung farm boy ... Cinderella story coming out of touch downs in over three hundred and fifty yards and he just got lucky is what happens is six touchdown [laughter] I Know a\nBiker Mayfield blade good again oh yeah uh he Cleveland last but they could have one I mean again could have gone either way they could have won that in fact when I turn it off I thought they had won it\nSomehow they were able to they didn't last that minute something when they got the ball back and somehow Oakland tied it back up again\nAnd so Bruton turkey got his first win as a well first one in ten years I guess Chuck ... cause you hadn't coach ... ... ... ... he\nHe was probably pretty happy to tell you weren't locked down by watching and yes I Know we're not supposed to be watching football 'cause we didn't watch it with great interest I Want to college game with much more interest than I watch\nIt as a passing the buck kind of like the new story on the cabin on the Supreme Court and the lady ... whether you like what's

there are other countries who want to deal and and sell us they're proud already been shut out and work so other countries come in and take up the slack so just have to give it a minute people\nRight before we were told that Canada is not going to put up with this this is just going to we're going to be a more going to have a trade war with Canada and Trump kept saying\nTrust me Oregon work with a

how you're manipulated\nYou're not allowed to really think for yourself on these candidates you'll watch these are political commercials they see these political commercials\nAnd you make a decision on how to vote based off of that so and Michelle Obama comes in and says you don't have to be smart to vote you don't have to know anything to vote you don't have to have any life skills or life dollars to vote\nI mean just go vote even if you're stupid you don't know what any of this stuff as a matter of vote anyway they want you to vote as long as you vote their way I thought that was incredibly stupid things [laughter] I don't care how dumb you are about politics you don't have to know about politics go vote\nWell I think that's how we got into this trouble [laughter] too many people voting on what the hell they're moaning about\nDon't get me started well\nYou may remember friday morning we told you lots of stuff friday\nYeah let me that we were you know pretty much right we told you before we left that the the obviously\nThe Supreme Court business wasn't done and I don't know what was going to happen but we knew a bunch Grapel is going to happen between friday and

snake in a grass right there has just done anything and everything he can to get paid by the Democrats when he leaves office he's leaving office and he admits\nThat he could not and would not have done what he did if he was running for reelection and then he says he followed his heart he said he changed his mind when a woman screamed at him on an elevator now what is it about following your heart\nAnd admitting you wouldn't have done it if you were running for reelection that don't line\nUp they just do work together first of all your a representative and you know what that means means you represent the people that elected you and what they elected you to do\nRight you know people blaming Ted Cruz for this Friday afternoon people saying\nHey cruise suggested the FBI or get have a week now Ted Cruz is the only one that got this out of its little Twenty one man committee and moved on to the bigger vote flake told him point blank I'm not\nI'm not going to vote this way it'll never leave committee\nUnless I get what I Want so he fell the whole thing up hostage so he can get the attention and he could get what he wanted\nTed Cruz is the only one there that was smart enough to broker a deal to figure out a way to move on to the to the full Senate isn't it\nTrue that whatever negotiate better much better [laughter] no it's not\nThat one of the things that happen friday morning was we told you about the big goal earthquake in Indonesia and I'm a seven to seven five or whatever it was just to get a salami\nAnd they got us through nominee yeah they don't want a lot of the big big huge news made an army last saw a ... I I Want to say salami a lot of salami is over there yeah\nAnd one of the things that happened because of the earthquake and tsunami that came along after they had um uh what what a little bit of a prison break\nThe prisoners it took his opportunity for\nYou know all the walls to been knocked down by big wall of mud in his early opportunity if you're in prison in the storm comes along ... down the mall and everybody kind of looks the same goes to their clothes are all wet and covered in mud and they're all run in and just so great escape\nThat about twelve hundred inmates escape from three detention facilities in the earthquake in the region there or you know\nRight after the quake water erupted from under the prison yard prisoners began to panic they ran out the through the fence on the road\nUm if there's any good news to all this twelve twelve hundred of them is that over there and Indonesia\nA murderer ... tend to be put to death so it's probably not murderers that are getting out of prison and Robert new seeds in bank robbers and yes like that because usually they kill the murderers\nI got ya so oh by the way the uh for one of those facilities that they took off from somebody set it on fire before they left well that's what you call ... ... ...\n... you know you probably get a bad feeling about the place and I'm sure you saw that one where they locked up uh what's your name um what's that little gal I doubt that was called\nCarrying a heroin or something ... and she was not treated well and these are horribly overcrowded prisons or detention center if you'd like to call your heads and rice wheat allies on them and stuff like that the\nPrisons are detention centers over there that are designed the whole like a hundred and fifty people have over five hundred people in\nIran over there they got the viewpoint that being in prison ought to be uncomfortable unlike America really weren't prison you've got to have a workout room gotta get 'em a library data give them a big screen TV gotta get 'em air conditioning you got an over there and they got wind of it there in prison to be enjoyable\nSo they see a little different than we do that how stupid do you feel if you're still in prison over there they said just over one hundred prisoners at the facilities are still there in jail oh man it's like that's like that John ... left\nOn a support your local sheriff's it was in the jail is no bars [laughter] Woodley didn't escape British Darren voices that said you were trapped in there when it daddy\nOr Walter Brennan canned again it may well you know this guy right here wouldn't let me leave yeah\nYeah no balls on the damn thing Dan's out\nAnd it wasn't that easy go James Garner was about ... said as a matter of the dumbest damn thing ever since I've been watching you boy for ah several days now into one smart thing yet where they agree with you on that one [laughter]\nKids lock it in ripping up off the deep sea get a faraway look it's Monday morning we're ready to start the weak bright eyed bushy tailed how about you\nKnow ... ...

some\nWay shape or form I mean the various\nInconsistencies what they're shooting like how the guy got all those guns up in that room I mean you've been to Vegas hotel before if you came repeatedly\nWhereas I don't know a bell boy and one of those big roller cards and you are carrying each time six hundred pounds worth of stuff up the elevator\nAnd I think somebody probably alerted someone or noticed or the ... alone\nWould have been a huge carry a huge a transport plus the all the different guns\nThat and then these all these hotels one\nThing that's common with all big and Mandalay Bay was no difference\nIs a huge amount of security cameras everywhere hallways doorways every floor gaming floor even like in a cafe or you've got pancake could step yup there's cameras everywhere shooting everything\nFor some reason the cameras on that full returned off and nobody had any footage of this guy moving all these guns into that room all that stuff\nNobody knew the cops
