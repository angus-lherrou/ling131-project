cabins so they've got a cool deal I've got a um [noise]\nYou can read the temperature got smaller built in so with my remote at my phone I can see the temperature is inside and outside got the camera inside it's gotten alert system on it and I could set ... temperature goes below a certain number and I set it up would ever want to be\nI get an alert and I know that something is happening the powers going out that he's gone on to power but the heat has gone out and the cabins getting too cold\nWhich could end up freezing the pipes and I could call a ... take a look at\nIt just one of the interesting side benefits I guess because you get the camera system for security you weren't able to see if there's somebody snooping around your house you get these alerts on your phone you get a little video you can see what's going on you could punch in watching a live video anytime you want it saves clips for you\nAnd I mean that's the older you want this alert before something happens if somebody has outside your house to get one which is ... doing\n... imagine if you had your family inside your way you could call them and say there's somebody outside you guys you know and he has some instructions for the call nine one one whatever uh at the same time there were these other benefits whether it's seeing if somebody's not package for you are finding out there's critters walk around and I certainly do that as well\nI got to tell you I Love this system is just the coolest thing as long as the cameras there real simple to set up their work off the Internet they work up go right to your phone you've got a phone app just simple as that can be now a blink gives ... uh Amazon company\nIt works with Alex's of course uh you can get three blink cameras for way less than what the other guys charging to get an extra Fifteen Percent off for being a gun talk Lester just go to ... protect dot com slash gun talk that's blink protect dot com slash gun talk or\nIt's cool stuff [noise]\n[noise] I'm I'm looking at getting ready for I'm going to be deer hunting end of next week getting almost effort he got my rifle a mammal hall slightly and it's interesting I went with a scope that might surprise people\nMight be hunting in a Idaho hung out west there so long distances and I have a scope at the top magnification when I was just six\nPower people out there using your board of ... sport sixteen power were lots of magnification here I Am popping out six power what's that about well I can remember when everybody hunted out west of the fix for power scope that was the deal\nIf you've never tried it here's something fun to eat a trial which are cool scope senators for power if you have a chance to shoot out three or four hundred yards and do some shooting I think you may be surprised if you're used to crank it way up high magnification you were looks small okay so what\nIt doesn't matter where it looks like can you hear what you're aiming at and you're gonna find that it four or five\nAnd by the natives we wouldn't have been hard to get Cherokee\nDNA they didn't bother getting any could have been real easy in other words I didn't get it because they knew it wouldn't matter no reason they didn't get it\nOh it's just a you know there is not a lie too big for a Democrat to just stop and does it no I Can't say that in public\nFor example this a fat guy that cut up in Saudi Arabia and everybody's all up in arms and it could be one of the biggest crime\nAnd actually can be one of the ... it could start a war it could be one of the biggest crisis in the world has gone up the journalist coast as journalists to up already he he kind of got all the upside of the the prince he didn't like him already CNN MSNBC ABC all the powers that be in the fake news media\nHave all got Trump being the reason this guy was cut up now listen to some of the reasoning\nWe've got a president that has already named journalists as being the enemy of the people said don't be surprised from other countries take on a journalist murderer chopping made the pieces and dispose\nDonald Trump it was always been critical of the Washington Post always been critical of his ownership did anybody in the administration in Jared Kushner didn't they have a\nSort of a nod in the wings you say it's okay for the\nPresident ... uh is a um as a reporter he's a columnist really are at a at a critical of uh the Saudi Government that stands in contrast with a message that the president has frequently sent to the American people and to his supporters that the media are the enemy of the people how do you square those two I Wonder\nIf you look at what's happened the last hundred days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric not just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with us from anything at all\nI Can't compare that to you say because this is the president's attacks on journalists because of an accurate and fake news reported that's kinda the same excuse the Iranians use the church and the Turks use the Chinese used and the Saudi she's right there issue is that these people who we think of the journalists reporting inaccurate and fake news about those governments or you can see the connection I'm making\nRight or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nI remember vividly at train trip up I mean I saw when I talk to a group for international and international grids to protect\nJournalists who told me it was within months of Trump taking office that they thought the world wide threat journalists showing up and this is kind of the room what is happening now in terms of human rights not only the journalists and several hot spots around the world\nAnd let's face it we've uprising I think it's a girl so the so the values like freedom of speech and defense\nSuddenly very endangered around the world\nYeah these are the people that don't allow any just set [laughter] well uh you'd you'd be shocked\nAt how little the people with those opinions you want to know what your opinion\nIs oh we found that out during the day has come to a fresh and their opinion you do not get that same right no

I get them confused all the time a Mississippi State\nAnd uh the quarterback from Mississippi State was there any its own and\nThat was a opportune time when a young fella broke through the line of scrimmage and had a shot in a sack as a quarterback it of course the quarterback drew the ball and that was that split second\nWhere you can hit a quarterback or when he throws the ball hit him how to make sure you well between here and here with only ... parts of your body contact in certain parts of\nIt out there was a thing they call targeting and as you know when they call targeting the guy that does the it's called for targeting is out of the game and out of half of the next game ha ha well\nThey they made that call and I said and I watch the replay said well once I said on replay they're gonna have to take that call back is that it's not targeting\nThe guy did not helmet to helmet contact him in space and he actually even put his hands out in front of him self to kind of push the guy back right there you go it wasn't enough it wasn't like a head\nShop he didn't push him in the head or the throat he pushed him into showed up or tourists\nA year and and kind of pushed it back and of course the gap he went to the ground because he was pushed by a a bigger man that he was charging through\nThe ... ... which is what happens when a big old guy comes through there so the call was made targeting well let's go to the replay booth and they showed a thousand times and that's all right once they've seen the ... and they came back and said yeah targeting confirmed\nOpposite like stood stood in of course\nAccusations are now being made that maybe the SEC does have too cozy a relationship with the Alabama\nAnd ... they just happened to pick the top defensive player yeah for the tires and they said well we'll just get this decade data half of the Alabama game\nSo yeah something is fishy there and somebody ought to launch\nA lawsuit car so shouts from the crowd of bull ... ... ...\nAre helpful but they never change the call yeah that that's because I I've been going to football games as I was eight years old and\nThat's when I first encountered the screens of bull oh ... what I call was made at the clown does had changed much in the last forty fifty are never change to call even one all that time they go there it almost makes them want to stick with it more when you when you do that [noise]\nBut anyway clearly\nThe replay official all to be fired because he doesn't know what targeting is\nBut she was probably told ... we need to be you know soften up that ... D a little bit because they've got you know a special\nTeam on up in two weeks that's the reason it needs to be fired yeah because when you firing then he'll go\nAnd they told me to tell you to die if

woman married to a guy who line you know she can kind of a rough up bringing any kind of a rough way arrest you couldn't survive you know she has to be strong in peril of a powerful willpower for that kind of kind of a woman at a given that forearm shiver upside yo head\nSometimes people need that yeah well I'm Sorry I missed it and it was a fun story in a sense I guess it's a oh Kay CNN aired it but it they didn't they just like to pass it along to you because CNN of course as you know got a side and the news and\nThey were talking about how bad the Jacksonville Jaguars are now if the Texans can you know beat him and beat 'em pretty soundly was that the rationale they were used that that's not the only thing but that that meant that the fact that the Texans well the jaguars or\nInjured and it wasn't even a close game and I just pretty much had that game all the way more nets been sidelined most of the season uh different ones are injured on the defensive players are missing but here's the real\nIssue whatever else is right or wrong with the jags they cannot win without a decent quarterback\nMortals so bad so shoot treated humiliated by the tech since he was benched for the backup Kessler who used to be a browns quarterback ugly he wasn't that good with them cats are kind of brought it up a notch\nWhen he came in I mean did he wrote us down pantsuit did look a little better out here to the team was so excited or that they they went out and lifted them on their shoulders man I don't I don't think he's kind of a big deal but the other guy was sucking so bad he came in and just sucked last clearly\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars\nMeet a quarterback and of course the real question is are they willing to do what's right for the franchise and accept column ... as they're safe you know this is the point of the whole story is to get\nCopper Nick ... a job\nAt my real football players that season real football coaches in football personnel managers know\nKatherine ... that I did the\nMost of the people running around ... diseases piece better than most of the quarterbacks that are playing in the NFL right now he's older you are being a throws out because of his race ... ... really was and\nYou know have you noticed the race of the Texans quarterback cowboys corner landed on the ah yeah I did mention about seven or eight others about half of the Kansas City quarter but uh yeah what ... what ... why are they getting jobs ... what's up with that\nBut you got to admit taken mortals out and replacing them with a black man this is all good stories [laughter]\nYou know whatever like manatee that goes dark on board will be a\nRelief banking ah ... there was a while he was good yeah wherever that is that there was a time when you said well\nWe take him over here it's got a ... I had\nA mallet yes stretch it might be after a while or what ever taken that anyway but long\nStory short I still don't stop the fact that Jason Garrett has to go ... ... the cowboys fell right in there like the idiot that could make the extra point against the saints pretty much the same sad tragic ending for them areas all they've got a new kick a field goal they get overtime they get a\nTie who\nShaped it\nAnd this is the guy remember they got rid of that old Dan Bailey guy so they have this hot young kicker well we gotta go young a point that you picked the wrong time because the other guy was like money in the bank\nShe was kind of like when the Texans got rid of that Potter\nThey shut down a bridge for an hour or so they made that effort let's cut it cut off the money\nQuick threatening\nAnd let's get those troops down to the border quit threatening troops let's get the troops down there our country\nIs being invaded were watching it gum or watching it they're like um if

and sometimes the sauces like you've got like the hot sauce and you dip it in the what the rancher the blue cheese or something to make it totally different\nBut at the end result is they said you'd be better off just having a damn burger over the hot wings because a hot when sometimes you just want to first of all who each one or two hot when you donate one or two and by the time you get half a dozen of them are six or eight of them are you eating way more than what a hamburger or would it cost you a calorie\nHim hot wings are good they are ... boneless ones that you know I mean I'll eat um
