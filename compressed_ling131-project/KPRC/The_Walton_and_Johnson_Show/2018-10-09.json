three for one happy hour drinks or something\nBut this woman had a different Wednesday evening about seven o'clock they say in Philadelphia [noise]\nShe got involved in a little bit of a road rage incident thirty three year old woman got another woman kind of mad at her and so this one woman in the road rage incident went up to the other woman\nAnd started stabbing her in the back I guess that would be mad yea thirty three year old woman says stabbed once in the back onto the shoulder and once in the left hand which I'm assuming a defensive wound you put it up play it hey stop stab\nMe at least up stabbing me manhood timing for uh\nThe assault or here as an off duty Philadelphia police officer saw the stabbing take place Mm the police officer managed to wrestle the knife away from the\nWoman but then the woman hop back in her car and fled the scene now these are some of our northern new\nPhilly ladies who are getting after each other\nSo they gave chase the ... ended up crashing her car about two miles away\nAnd then of course was a little hesitant to peacefully comply with the officers request to exit the vehicle and so uh I I don't know if the window broke during the crash or if they just yank the door but they did in fact\nProbably her out of her car using a you know the fifty thousand volts of the bars of justice which caused her to a definitely hop right

but in Honolulu, Hawaii a man lunge at a police officer with a machete ...\nBad enough but where the machine cuts or not you think\nTo yourself if I lunge at this officer with this machete are they going to tell you or me with a non lethal weapon or are they going to think to themselves this guy needs to get shot turns out to officers had differing opinions on the subject\nWhile one officer was avoiding the machete\nAnother officer fired a taser at the man and a third officer put four or five rounds\nInto him so as you can see opinion very\nI'm sure the officer that was being attacked with a machete was probably thinking to himself\nShould have shown a taser ing is for another day maybe for the lady with a\nPocket knife yeah that's\nWhat you got to consider before what you go to restart

by laundered will not break the record that will just tie him with Tom Brady at bird overall right now for\nA for Ninety nine\nTom Brady got five hundred bread fall rural has five hundred and eight and then Peyton Manning have five hundred and thirty nine so everything is about forty Drew Brees knees forty to tie\nPeyton Manning forty one to break the all time touchdown ... rarely for gang he
