[noise]\nYeah just picked up by certain one ten at a gives\nA whole new meaning to dry practice\nI explain if you were to people who don't know what is the ... gun\nAssert its acronym that I Can't remember a time basically in my case the one candidate essentially a glock Seventeen frame a tougher setting trigger with a laser indicator to show when you have the trigger I'm at the breaking point and then once you break the trigger [laughter]\nSo now you have a very similar trigger poll cheer Kerry got ... ... draw aim fire you see a light practice right in your living room [noise]\nAnd and you can do and the thing is you can do it safely we don't have to say gee triple check to make sure your gun so loaded because there have been quite a few televisions that have been shot during dry five practice\nYou know in a with a ... gun it is not a real gun there's no way to load it but it has a good trigger it has this laser feature that shows you where you're shot would have gone right\nCorrect so basically it and it's fairly good at it again and say you diagnostic as fear\nCalling if you're a slap in the trigger yet the shots gonna show left or you thought it was going to go\nOut and [laughter] yeah\nYeah how long you had a training at right now I've\nUsed them off and on um with other trainers I broke down and actually just purchased one this week I probably you know put eight or nine ... nine hundred trigger pull through it already just this week but\nHow much did that cost [noise]\nAh I again I'm I'm an entering a circus I got a bit of a discount on it but I gather that the one ten and one can and then a are ... basically the same thing except as a replacement for your AR um for under three hundred dollars [noise]\nAnd that's not bad I even if you bump it up and you're not getting the instruction price\nYeah which is a hundred bucks there about\nOkay I I mean yeah and they are the FBI isn't we're now will do well this gun going you're holster\nIt does in fact that ... if it's if it fits into a box of fits in right to ah write into lots of being all start they also have one that a different model that will that will do the same thing for those that carry this went and watched them but I find\nAs an instructor you can appreciate this this information that they're sipping no substitute for pulling the trigger a lot and yeah I Know it doesn't help you manage recoil but it does help you work on your trigger press\nTrigger presses the biggest thing is the biggest thing that I struggle with on the biggest thing the the the folks that I help coach struggle with so [laughter] yeah\nI I just is so are you going to use that in your instructions with people\nYes I'll use it I I use it I'll use it um again is that um\n\nIt it's something we need in a classroom before the we go to the range in that right at us get more ... done before we're out on tour arranged for now it's you know the knowledge that everybody has electronic hearing protectors they may or may not hear what you're trying to explain\nExcellent well look I presume that's great to arrange for certain pistols um you know what we're going to do we're gonna have to hunt those guys down got fined get somebody from that company to come talk to us because I Know a number of really good instructors who are big believers insert pistols for training\nA it's a safe way to do your dry fire also you can use it for kind of modify not real force on force behind us\nAnd it can help you safely move in practice you're shooting that type of deal so pretty good tool\nTo tell you what [noise] one of these I Want to talk about actually a couple of things we talk about what happened we Levi Levi he's the blue jeans company also what's going on with the whole Kevin ... hearing because\nThere were a lot of agendas inflation guns played a big part of it the second amendment guns gun bans posturing a lot of noise\nMinded will do things are you there I think that pretty much covered\nBy almost everything gift you enjoy a good laugh at me most often make me laugh I don't know about you\nThere's a place where you can post a picture of your own homemade bomb now this is how serious the average American is taking these ridiculous suspicious packages being founded Democrats doors\nThe fact that they don't think that we sort of think this is their own plot mhm is that we ... takes us back to the how stupid they think you are and will\nRemember once you commit to a lot you get to stay with that you cannot change all stories all they have doubled down they still got packages coming out today now Cory Booker supposedly got a pac man\nSee we've reached that stage where a lot of people are upset because they didn't get a pack and right it's very upsetting if you're considered to be a prominent pain and the side\nOf Donald Trump I mean other other left wing gather doesn't accept the election 'til sixty five million people that are I Want to undo their vote because they voted wrong I mean come on where's my mom now I don't get about\nHow can I help you excuse me young man I'm from the Federal Bureau of investigation\nYou you are oh my oh I can I help you with us today sir Simon have you been sending suspicious packages around the country to politicians and members of the media oh you mean my clock's yes I have your clocks yes those are just science experiments sorry my school\n... remember clock voice a card boys a bomb was probably more dangerous than these but uh yeah these fake bombs that are have been sent around everybody and of course if you didn't get one I'm really sorry\nFor the uh me most of the fake bomb makers were post your big bomb pictures now this one my favorites so far is a a cardboard roll from inside of toilet paper the cardboard tube where the wristwatch around it\nAnd your apple headphones run through it and then they wrote on it orange man bad\nMm [laughter]\nThese are hilarious that's as bad as scary as this little cigars sized and now they showed that big buildings where CNN is located\nIn midtown Manhattan and then they showed that bomb\nThat somebody threatens the building where the CNN which is about the size of one of Trump's cigars yeah and uh they evacuated the building for that that's one of the ones that put pictures of on the Internet and it really\nYou're putting pictures of evidence on the Internet\nYeah because we want people to see it as soon as the guy who took like a six pack up north for a pack of monster energy drink and as wires coming out of the top of them are of course you know tape them all together\nAnd attach maybe a like a calculator to it or something it's just so funny\nBut nobody's taking the serious except the media and they look ridiculous doing it they're running around telling us to calm down and don't be afraid\nWe're not afraid of the fake bombs okay\nBut one of the media's telling you to be afraid before they tell you to not be afraid\nThey're fake bombs were not stupid\nThese little Jimmy read things with the the wires hanging out of the little watches tests yeah that was the way they aren't bombs I mean we can fight bomb yet but since they were incapable\nOf exploding there was nothing to explode\nOr there were no trigger devices to make anything explode they were not bombs they were as we told you twenty four hours ago\n[noise] suspicious publicity devices oh let's just in\nA Dianne Feinstein says she received a bomb last summer he wasn't sure if she does say anything\nAbout it until now [laughter] yeah that's\nRight it's actually a ticket ... she's always a little bit behind the times [laughter] oh God and we finally found out a who's leading the march of ah of immigrants on the invasion of the U.S oh your caravan yeah yeah I mean I only got a\nA a picture of the guy leading the up and damage it ain't\nForrest Gump well just like that everybody was following me to America there during his long hair running days running\nPhase yes there's another going\nSecret Service relief sketches of the bomb makers bolo has been issued beyond the lookout picture a bore us in the ...\nAnd they got one of those around bombs with the ah the few stinking offshore it certainly right bomb on it it looks like a bowling ball with a few that a lot of my favorites is the video of Jake\nTapper they had they photo shop is head or that old Batman\nScene from the original Batman when we were fat man's running through the streets of that bomb over\n... looking for ways you just can't find a plane or way to get rid of a bar in a bomb and I've heard that put tappers head on Batman and they were they shouldn't be making as much fun of Chuck Todd as possible\nNBC's Chuck tidy it was Chuck Todd says he fears the Russians not up to the Boogie Man the Russians are behind the ... hey if anybody knows how to make a real bomb it be your average risky wouldn't you think I think that I Would think a Russian be ashamed to send us bombs out they will you\nCan prevent wildfires\nVenue Sam [noise]\nList feels like a spot\nHave this fear that it could be some Russian operation to design to do what's\nHappening now more of this you know and I think if we and so in some ways we shouldn't were allowed so what what what if it was Democrats trying to effect shopping and\nNow they rise rule that out they ruled it out instantly and immediately nobody takes that seriously [laughter] ah yeah with a bunch\nOf Damascus you vote for a Democrat that's the kind of people you're putting on your team you know when we used to be kids would would pick teams for a a game or something it was like All right I'll take a ... all too good Jimmy over there you know\nNone of these Democrats would get picked nobody wants to them\nOn your side much us naval in wind and victims you know my vote no other great name with a picture of a bomb on it and\nMaybe that was from the show us your bomb the poll FDR homemade bomb here it's a picture of Scott the envelope and it said from obvious Trump supporter [laughter]\nEveryone does that like drop\nAnd that has got a can of Bush baked beans all boy with a little timer attached to it and it's got\nSome popcorn\nCrawfish tails and little basket next to it rented it with a wire rented that to control what\nIt's called a Cajun pipe bomb oh boy [laughter] they just\nCan't that\nNobody is afraid to just lay it out or you pay a chilling them that we're not a so concerned about their precious ... fear has gripped the nation a nation has gripped in the year nah nah nah no no not really nations fine we're good where are grouped in fear ... believe it or not\nBut you're more odds barely using a apple\nHeadphone wires or chargers and wrist watch is the way most people feel like they need to construct the fake bomb I've seen a lot of that and the pictures oh and then there's this one [laughter] somebody just put a hand grenade in a blender [laughter]\nJust on and watch what happens\nHere is a picture of you remember David Axelrod to do with the weird moustache used to advise\nObama\nYou said you know Chicago there was an old tradition of throwing a brick through your own campaign office window and then call a press conference say you've just been attacked\nTouch right somebody attacked me because I stand for I fight for you\nThis is just a new one out of the old playbook use in a new angle this is like the breaking through the campaign office window you through it through your own window and then went oh my God that anybody wonder why every democratic politician had statement\nReady to go\nAnd they found all the bombs virtually on the same day puzzles a lot of\nPeople if you've ever used the postal service that you could mail twelve packages let's say from one location and they would get to California and New York and all these different location at the exact same time\nAnd they went all know to look for them and find them and then contact someone\nAnd then suddenly the news organizations had this list of people\nAll obvious drop enemies who at all receive bombs and that's the one and only thing that tide them altogether except for his human jak critical of Trump Sheila Jackson Lee still has not received a bomb that she might want to go with that whole\nI got a bomb several weeks ago and I didn't really you know make it I didn't think it was that serious and yesterday she said\nWell mom how come I don't get no bomb somebody blew Sheila Jackson Lee\nThat I like where you don't when\nWe are thinking we ought to store\nHere in Washington on a branch\nLaunching noodle is linked to the Rio Grande\nImmigrants coming here more men are like\n\nThey're waving the flag to many land where\nThey're not an area of any other land they got a ... they want a miracle on ... on one\nOrdering like and they even got a communist language\nTheir coming because it's\nMore\nTo do [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSmoke treat to ram a Gucci\nI came in here prepared for battle this morning no holds barred take no prisoners taking it to the wall as Trump let's say\nDid you see the ... yeah I I heard it through secondhand through Ken the cargo barrel that we're just going through the motions today and get the battles been cold ah I'm cool with that did and really what I feel like doing that just\nPractice is fine I mean we could we could get the battle back up again by late late week yeah you know good practice rewrite limber up all of them but also it is Monday morning\nWhich is your most likely day of the week to have a heart attack\nI ... I just felt my bills pretty good good good and if you were going to have a heart attack on a Monday morning guess when the hours you're most likely to have at our by now right about now when I'm bored I'm here in a field my boy do I feel\nA lucky should not had one at this point jak so far so good but that just say you know one of these days I'm going to be sitting here going [laughter]\nYou guys are going to be land but like I'm doing some kind of joke and then we're you know I told your vote by the ... on the floor with my legs in the air it's going to be that this might be the real deal ...\nWhat do you like this is how this is that we will find a way to start today Boston Red Sox are the champions you didn't\nFollow that all the way to the English and that's a boring series yes it was a LA just barely won one game and it was the longest game in baseball history there was two games basically so I took a mat long to win one again I\nWould say Los Angeles should just\nSkip\nYeah I mean they probably have the ability to win the next year and come back again but they're going to have the possibility be known as the Buffalo Bills or the world series\nJust to be safe the Dodgers should probably do everything they can to not even make it to the world's degree I think that's best yeah uh it\nLooked at a ... or the ... crew or somebody else come represent next year you're just yeah maybe the Braves the Rio rival of the Braves back on the scene you guys just take a seat because they're looking at a bad for\nI Do believe the Astros we'll be back next year the guy that just took the red Sox to the world series in one it was with the Astros last year at the world series\nAlex Cora the manager was an Astros last year ... he was after World Series so this is his Second World series victory in a row\nCalled being at the right place at the right kind of Johnny on the spot is nice and may may go for one for the thumb here right combat dude you got ten fingers you to get to rage okay\nThat's nice speaking technically\nFoot the first one to get on the book I don't go crazy with that you could just go around play but I got one for the Bob here but you really just the one ... one last night handling\nAlthough probably in the first three quarters of the same like they could have probably could have gone in your way but in the end it was a pretty firm ask kicking there were a team like Minnesota and they were not happy there was a lot of helmet slamming and a finger pointing and\nOr a charge anyone really but next time the media tells you that Donald Trump is Hitler maybe you'll believe them now because what us Hitler gills juice it's like\nIt's like Trump took her gun himself yeah waded into that so they got no of course you and I rational people know this was a nut job who hated Jews\nWho by the way hated Trump or just as well is also a Trump he made a point of mentioning that apparently I'm motivated by conspiracy theory that Jews are funding the migrant caravan now see that's the part where they\nSee truck talking negatively about the caravan and then this guy ties to Jews next thing\nYou know he's opening fire would love to see the thought process cut up you know written out on paper as to how he tied the Mexican or during the caravan in Mexico to choose well analyze all Jews would want to bring terrorists into the country where they are well George Soros says I'm\nFinancing the caravan\nGeorge Soros is a Jew although he's not practicing Jew he's he's not embracing it so to speak as a matter of fact that's how I Survived Nazi Germany he acted like he wasn't what\nHe denied his Jewish mission to actually helped collect has\nNot a delicate way to put a articles of things like closing shoes teeth and whatnot from Jewish people right before they mask killed them\nHe went around and help to gather that up as part of his showing Nazis how are you he was just [noise]\nAnd uh you gotta buy her a sneaky ski bastard\nLike that I mean sure you want to stay alive self preservation okay but after World War two over then you've got to let go of that he he didn't he kept on with it that's the problem man well\nWe'll we'll get that solves eventually\nA main well Halloween won the box office\nAt the movies for the second week in a row in star is born did pretty good and\nThere was a ... hunter killer yeah that was a new one ah came in fifth which is not too good when you and your brand new and everything else has been out a while\nIt had some people in it that you heard of and it had submarines shooting at people and trying to kill others submarines but\nI'm the only way to really guarantee I hit now or the box office it looks like the only lead pipe synch guarantee his animation jerk animate anything\nWith cute little characters and do if they happen to be voiced by some famous singer all about is that even better but it's not absolutely necessary\nAnimation that's the key animation is very expensive by the way it's not cheap to do\nSpeaking of Halloween as we approach it rapidly now this wins that he had a lot of people had at this weekend ... costumes out and\nAbout it was weekend you can stay up late so a lot of people sort of already did Halloween but I guess it comes what Tuesday night Wednesday Wednesday night yeah so the middle of the week nobody could stay up late\nOne of the scariest things you will ever here has already been buttered here just a few days before Halloween as Hillary Clinton speaking at an event in New York City Missouri and ride a night said\nBrace yourself and I quote I I'd like to be president\n[laughter] I mean it's pretty much oh Jimmy\nWe redeemed last election and then some body went and acted like it was a real election and want it\nWhen asked about running she said I don't want to run again what she wants is to win the last one ... are are just hand me they're still trying to win the election from two years ago which is why they're having trouble finding somebody to run they still say any twenty\nBut there's some way yeah this through some sort of machinations of Trump wrongdoing and enough support from different senators of the Democratic stripe and whatnot is there some way they can just\nPlace Hillary end the presidency there of course is no scenario\nThat allows that that it's just I had shaker to see these people that you would you get kind of expect maybe the general public thinks that way but she was a senator for eight years secretary of state she's now because one was birth and I'll just be able to a lot of areas with this if you\nPut a they've all got like hundreds of years of experience if you add it all up but yet they know how stupid you are and they're thinking\nWell you know he felt we do with that Cabot I'll think this guy was a boy scout for thirty five years a public service we went back in ... that are from high school and damn near got him throw it off the Supreme Court\nYou are you looking forward to that I always did think go Bogle fit needed a little bit more you\nKnow we don't know what he looks like he's got like a cat on his head Idaho's cool [laughter] you know like a garbage can and it's all fat was kind of like the Batman\nOf Star Wars yeah never showed a safety anyway and and he didn't have an old ... ... s coolest stuff as the ... but for somehow he still manage to get it out think out trick out maneuver the GED I was\nOn a budget he's a bounty hunter yeah he ... he doesn't have a government backing or his thing\nYou know you had like a utility belt pool of really cool tall a lot of it was homemade Jeffrey made in his little shot back at the moment and outs [laughter] I guess we'll just have to wish it was like Hillary presidency it just it's not going to happen will have to keep your fingers crossed it still could yeah\nChris Rock will direct Kevin Hart in a movie called we both have white people a lot that'll be fun\nTo me a lot of mine I'm told it's called co parenting but I guarantee you the crux of that movie is boy that we have white people\nWell you can understand you know the white white people be an act in Langley common yeah Mike Tyson is a wanting to do\nA um one of these cable series TV shows about his life\nAs a marijuana grower you know that a lot of people say what happened to Mike Tyson he put some of this fight money he became he invested in a marijuana grow situation he's a marijuana or I don't know if he's in a Colorado arenas but he's a professional marijuana grower in out\nThere are ... physical to you know yeah it sounds like a winter winter right there I mastered the art of a small corner culture you still have is tiger\nI think he just had the tiger wood that one movie oh I don't know I don't think he really had a tiger looked like he had a tiger to me I'm stuck you're allowed to have a tiger are you oh yeah oh yeah there's more tigers here in America and I think more just in Texas ... then there are left in the wild you know that's he's not just pull out of his ass\nOr I read that someplace it we have more wild animals under private ownership in Texas because we're kind of outlaw state in any other place in the in the world\nWhich ain't good for the tigers who knows no they're they're not thrive in a long time to the bar and they\nPut them in cages it's not it's not good for the animals\nWe got a email about the situation you you know the killing that took place this week the synagogue yeah shooting at the JV right Ga they was a [noise] you ever ask yourself why\nEverytime I'm Muslim terrorists blow something up flies a plane into a building and kills a bunch of people first thing we're told is that we do not labeling entire group of people based on a few extremists that's right but here we are\nEvery Republican is just like this old white guy that shot up a synagogue even though he is not really came out and said that but he's old white man and I'm just filled with ... and so every old white man is exactly the same\n... personally I think the Democrats are behind it I always believe that I remember it to the Democrats left the media we are all worse than any Muslim terrorists based on their logic which they don't really use\nComing up I use my powers of observation which apparently people in the media have completely lost all powers of observation I have observed that are good observation that uh because some of their reporting let's face it\nThey have earned the moniker fake news\nThat Trump is put on them because they're so even Fox's drifting into fake\nYeah and Chuck Todd ... you know we get the emails about his dad Joe jobs of the whole weekend basically uh just encouraging Trump to come on out and take credit for this hour blame for the synagogue shooting and he refused\nOh as well as the DOD wants to know why Trump isn't stepping forward and accepting blame that and the fake bombing well yeah that was a guy has his blood brother down there just ... a guy named safe SARS society\nHas been called a white guy\nI Wanna ... that's where my power of\nPositive of thinking and observation content of we went up to hit want to share with you some of the

let's take this situation out of\nSouth Florida actually got ourselves a situation Hillary was just in Florida recently and then all of a sudden move a guy in Florida has been found to be the mask the bomber now coincidence probably but it's sad to see our guy\nDrops big buddy this is not the dog whisper as it is so different seats are\nNow [laughter] the these are guys some of these people have got around and found\nAll or\nScreen shots of the social media before the fed stepped in and I raised at all like they're always do\nAnd we found that this guy she saw her was following Ellen DeGeneres he was following Jimmy Kimmel us following several other real rabbit Trump haters a Steven cold there he was following Steven called bear and then suddenly\nTwo weeks before this event comes down he stops following all those people it becomes a huge Trump fan overnight a van which has been in this guy's name for a few months but nobody's ever seen them\nDr toll gay well how could he possibly drive it with all the windows completely covered\nThe window stickers us to talk about the window stickers the sec somebody brought up a guy that used to be an FBI agent I he's probably not

alternate Johnson a radio program Majid more when you bought a radio for yesterday when the ...\nYou notice [laughter] yes I'm pet shop always coming up for our ... uh no that's pretty much in in the eighties saying it was a quick trip yeah I got were slashed ... we're waiting for the queen movie\nI Know you guys have already talked about baseball and it's not my purview technically each bring a sports for the show but I didn't want to mention Alex ... who used to do something for the Astros last year when they won the world\nHe was a coach with the Astros last year not the coach not the manager yeah manager that that he got promoted to manager Boston and apparently they made a pretty good pair Boston like the way that the Astros a beat up on the Yankees last year they used the exact Astros plant\nAnd so Alex Cora leads the red Sox to a championship in his first year\nThe mayor of Boston can be in front of the parade in the victory himself the mayor of Houston will probably telephone him and tell him how to do it you know Sheila Jackson Lee ... leave I Want to go out and be in that part of that [laughter] yeah never can tell\nAlex car a is a Puerto Rican\nProfessional coach now and former player and manager of the Sox\nAs we say in sports binoculars we just were you I wouldn't useless horsemen accurately back to the guys like us you know\nThe a grizzled veterans that know how to use it\nThat I'm aware of him and his name is because I was just a little surprised\nBecause baseball generally as opposed to the NFL baseball tends to not be very political but I guess in Boston it doesn't hurt as Alex Cora and has already said I mean they they hadn't been World Series champions long\nThey hadn't been invited yes but he's already said sure if\nThey're going to be making that trip to the White House when the time\nCome or you know what that really\nThat it really makes me disliked the school I don't even know what I thought that might be of interest to you but an asshole Alex ... says that they haven't discussed it but some of the players on the team might have an issue as to what Alex might have an issue is the\nManager is another thing he said he was going to do is take the world series trophy you put it on display down in Puerto Rico it's kind of like\nWhat about Boston the people that live there often when the games in ... tickets and whatnot
