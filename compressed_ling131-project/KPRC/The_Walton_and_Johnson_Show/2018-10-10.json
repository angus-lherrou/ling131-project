I think he just wanted to get on television so I said\nYou know Fox you don't put me on any more what if I put myself in the store job would you put me on there the danger zone baby or may not risking death\nGenerators so we have electricity when the electricity goes up you know New Orleans had radio and until Katrina blew our tower death yeah that was very rude well or poorly located tower I guess put it right in the track of a hurricane some idiot didn't think you know what hurricane\nBad place but it's our someplace else and a non hurricane situation [noise] uh but that's not our job\nAll during a Harvey\nStation above my one of five three was the only station in the city that remained on during the hurricane about that that's the only adult here dumb luck [laughter]\nLike Russian roulette was unbelievably dumb luck we stay or ... or ... or ... there was like nine feet of water at the translator say you couldn't get out there but the ... donned ran on its own it had a five hundred gallon diesel tank so it just stayed on the other states how do they do that\nHow do they stay on the sheer luck\nThat's out but we really were on this one we over here we have dodged a bullet and we are out of the woods and we are looking good\nIt's going to be a wonderful day over here only ally chance of rain over in this part of the Gulf of Mexico I understand you've got a little turbulence over on the other side of the Gulf of Mexico and we're watching that for you\nIt's going to be a a bad day at black rock the Houston Astros have inherited the red Sox aren't the red Sox the ones that play the Neil Diamond a\nSweet Caroline roller possibly I don't hear much about other teams besides the Astros though I'm officially banning sweet Caroline from places to do it or at least so we find out more oil or right I think it is I think they're the ones that did the sweet Caroline nuts it was a rematch from\nLast year I guess 'cause we are supposed to play the red Sox during the playoffs\nI but I guess it wasn't the eighty Z a tale known it'd be that was the Yankees so but the Yankees are\nGone they put the big boy way what's his name judge and that whole group have been told to go to the house in as a matter of fact they were\nTaunted by the red Sox you sound like some ... ... yeah\nAh they were targeted by the playing of a New York New York and the clubhouse\nAfter that history so that that\nThat wasn't nice I mean that was necessary most of the game gets a home field advantage\nThey start at home Saturday and Sunday but at least the Astros now get the respect because Boston is getting the respect of playing\nBite yeah Batman will not be able to complain about sun burned aren't genetic says he's going to be able to play in the evening it was his way of saying oh we're the world champions but we're not good enough for prime time television we got to play the businessman special in the middle and he's got a point\nBut it has nothing to do with the EU Astros it all has to do with\nFirst of all the factors you're playing Cleveland that the the two sided equation that didn't help at all been playing Boston or New York you to that and the prime time schedule too but it's it was the fact that you were playing Cleveland\nAnd we weren't big enough to pull that up or big you know we're not New Yorker or Los Angeles or even Boston I guess for that matter but ah yeah\nWhich is a businessman special for you guys 'cause you're playing Cleveland okay obviously we've\nBeen avoiding the real story all morning and I guess\nWhen we get termites debating the city when we get back Frank spider break that going to have to go ahead and answer the question ... heads on baby why is Nikki Haley\nResigning as US ambassador to the un all I Know is this some drummed into her that's all I Know\nShe she wouldn't tell us the real reason all she would tell us is that she felt like she spent enough time at the job and she when I lost that ... you know we were forced to speculate about exactly what happened who we are ... but what did he do\nCNN and places like that it's it's it's not just she's just quitting and moving on to ... no no there's something a Kavanaugh raped her or something we don't know what yet but I've never seen the news media\nMore upset about something\nThey did it or why across the board than the fact that they did not have an inkling they didn't ... this was coming they didn't uh pre report it\nSo yeah those days are fast fast now that we don't get that anymore well for one thing concert tickets are now\nLike two hundred dollars apiece three hundred for the cheap seats four hundred maybe they're not giving up the DJ's anymore now they're giving them to the general managers is going to happen to lose a little jaded\nYou go a lot better pay to go to a concert say yeah but you know back in somebody was somebody was paid to go or are we going to have the concerts sure but we got a little spoiled so it's the same way with a great\nSpectacular radio programs like this one you get 'em for free and you get a little jaded like well what do you pay for that show what's your monthly fee on that show whether it's no monthly fee it's free why\nWell there can be very good if it's if it's free\nYou might want to say is a ... I found is that now it it sounded a little conceded what I'm hearing here but what you forgot to mention was this is the greatest radio show of all time in the history of radio that you will be a part up\nOh you live that part out oh well that that you will personally it'd be a barn up\nHow do you know you're going to be a part of it I'm On it right now I mean you mean yeah you may you yeah you're you're yeah partially personal gotcha right it's it's a pretty good show but it ain't so much great as a as I'm sure you've noticed\nOver the last few months or years or however long you been down around listening to morning radio or not so great but Doesn't Suck as much as the other morning shows the crucial international\nFederation of photographic industry in the I. S. P. I. if the if he\nWould I I Know there was no such thing as a as a yeah thirty eight set of people still stealing music and they're whining basically saying if all the would pay for it [laughter] well how good will they be doing now is it a witch counts for thirty two percent of copyright infringement\nOr illegal downloads from yeah when people give something to someone else like oh let me send you the file on that you're just stole to music if safe yeah walk again about a thief because they're not supposedly\nThey're not allowed to give you that ... even though they've got it on their computers I said let me just send you that whatever\n... illegal what what if a guy let's say it was a guy let's just say a guy like that I knew you were asking for for ... for for what am I guy\nI knew gave me a CD and said uh here you borrow this sea duty and while I borrowed it\nOh wait a minute I a copy boy into a like a laptop computer turned it into a into a digital files and on your computer he bought the C. D. my no\n... but then I just downloaded and well I gave it back to him but I've still got all the music the way they look at the rules as you as far as the physical\nCD you bought the piece of plastic that the music is a blast and onto mhm but the actual musical tunes on their uh or not if you read the little tiny\nFine print this on the packaging\nWhy probably need my glasses for that I didn't have a with me that tells you there's no copier there's no copying there is no editor and there's no that that that's allowed so that's a some kind of FBI super duper federal violation of the law sometimes you just did\nSome fans are still celebrating the the Drew Brees record breaking excitement of Monday Night football and some are still puzzled over St to running\nBack Alvin come era and what must be thinking what is in that gas bill of mush fi shows up pre game Monday Night arriving at the superdome he was spotted wearing\nA make Africa whole McGahn fat\nIt's kinda like making fun of ...\nIt may do their looks just like America had only ... the words are spelled out front because it's all spelled out on the hat it's a ... ... am I ha make Africa home again and again and also wearing a Colin Kaepernick\nA forty niners support Jersey yes\nAnd which by the way you're a member of the New Orleans saints not the forty niners it is unknown for district\n... he's already done in the early morning research we don't know for a hundred percent sure if I'll ever\nPreviously lived in Africa uh-huh the general fall amongst sources is that he's never even been there is not from there although his mother is Liberian which is part of\nAfrica he as you say that's the only part of Africa yeah and maybe she is taught him in his early or you know just how when when she would sit next to his bed and and read stories to him romanticizing the prospect what's life would be like in Africa it's his first name Alvin Alvin ...\nAlvin do you realize that when you make Africa home again I'm just throwing this out there\nThere won't be a million dollar paycheck for you anymore there's probably going to be if you say a million\nFell out of it and come air assigned a four year contract worth of three point eight five seven million I'm I'm gone that's around a million a year is it per year yeah my or is it for a okay\nSo it's around a million a year or the Alvin what probably what job do you when you make Africa home again as you'll probably be given a machete and directed to the banana a\n... year old over here be hacking doubts bananas and load and ... there is no professional football league in Liberia is not the er\nAt the Capitol ... is the annual salary is about thirty five thousand a year that's a good average jets are you doing pretty good if you and thirty five year there yet now there is a semi pro league over in Algeria and Egypt or Kenya\nAnd usually they don't uh Obama's homeland they don't make seven figure salaries no they don't make the Camaro money Mm So when you make Africa home again as I Hope you will if that's what you really want to do I want to know who's holding back\nA is it that contract when you do that\nI watch it to just think back on how cool it was to be and the good old USA Today where all of this race hate was gone I primarily from your side no way I Would point out the right to say\nOut by the way a little PS at the bottom of the story Alvin you should know Liberia is currently home to one of the worst Ebola outbreaks though world has ever seen so you've got that\nGoing for you you know you don't want to know what a around what\nStation is this anyway I just had it on and then just in\nJersey like you said that extra money savings for you and you get your cash quick quick within twenty four hours of using pay pal or request that check in the mail or you do is open the ab Jews the gas station they offer and then you upload your receipt and\nYou get cash back get it called get upside\nI suppose to a job or I Want me to be overwhelmed with resume which made it easy to miss a great candidate\nWhole process was not smart then I went to recruit it's technology fines the right people actively invites them through apply so I get qualified candidates fast smart\n... recruiters read it never\n... and the song\nI'm already have several emails asking the same question I had a way or do you get one of\nHats oh ah make Africa home again we've got a lot of listeners that want to be wearing a hat\n\n\nAsked one day\n\nA helmet survive without yeah\nI was just very [noise]\nYeah ...\n[laughter]\nBed every morning Johnson\n\n\n\nFrom both\nHanded strangers of rock and roll\nAnd this guy yeah and that we have we had a pretty good rock and roll vibe going to you pop editor with\nMe even more\nThat does not rock let me just tell you that right now a little special hugs and kisses to mind who ... who they are spread of fact we're just talking this morning about how much more effective hurricane warning should be instead of having the governor\nThat Governor with the navy had on from Florida other any governor governor governor of Louisiana the other thing literally a not inspiring\nFear Rick Scott comes and goes I'd like to say that everyone needs to a\nA hot button down\nNow and if you haven't left yet it ... it's very dangerous\nAnd thus we could we experienced hurricane force winds in Tallahassee so you would like\nA professional broadcaster like yourself probably to take that job but no I Would like somebody from the world wrestling federation or to somebody like John see that for example to do or the hurricane warning back into day hulk Hogan would it be a good ... today you know the rock ocean waves there\nSend your ass you'll be thinking I should have listened to John said when he told me to get\nYour ... your lips up against the inside of the roof of your addict trying to get one last breath of Arab roller you're gonna wish you'd have left\nI sure don't listen to John Siena and that kind of is that we'll get your attention you see I guess they\nSay just throw it out I mean drill instructor for you know I go to the Marines I Would be good yeah Leah or meat or a drill instructor telling you to\nGet out of Florida right now there's this hurricane is not here to cycle you like your mom on it takes no prisoners and kills all for it you want to stay where you are if you want to get out well I kind of thing I mean it'd be more effective\nI just think that yeah now I think the governor looks like a total of well can I say Patty waste anyway yeah that's one of your own terms I milk toasty up I just wanted to tell you before all that candy asked I sit in on it and what not to say\nI like your song is okay what is it a little\nSalt me he Drew Brees well that's actually scanners those song we just you know under presented in\nBut see in my head instead of the breeze now I'm thinking they call me Drew Brees scene I guess if if I'm Elle Ringo were to do one for example you could change all the lyrics where are you good luck and getting ring\nGringo to do something you know he didn't get up this er yeah he was probably up late last night Mr showbiz he also he might be mobilizing with the Cajun Navy to help these Florida people and we can't put our\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\n... do we sound as new fee to them uh I think probably soon I don't think we sound like a guy I talked to them do we\nMade all the uh the American league playoffs have come down to it it's down to two teams do first\nWhile teams battle to find out who is going to remain who's going to add to the world\nSeries will not be a return trip up the street so I get so nervous when it's right down to it like this oh those bastion Red Sox\nFARC aroma Yankee Stadium [laughter]\nThose filthy rich so I play in New York New York trolling there for\nThe victims\nOf ... the the Yankees all most came back pulled it out and then at the end they lost it's always hard to feel sorry got all the ... you don't\nI don't know the red Sox Frank away from it [laughter]\n\n\nThe the three out of four\nI guess let me go to me or you could say Boston\nGet get get get\nWhat they did like Boston Red Sox you're about to play the world champions of the other hand do your ass\nYou got to be will Springer ...\nAn hour to ... to recover ... from the south that is a ... at least favorite player of the whole world Mr out to eat one of the little sports besides baseball and football or does a little some in the NBA\nNews this ... you get a kick out a little some the Cleveland Cavaliers\nHave turned the world James old locker into a towel close that I liked it but you know they had a ... foot in the mud room already and liberals locker is just right over there you know with all the ...\nI think they also put up pictures you in the journal ... they they went ahead and they said this is a little space right here\nWe're just going to use that and I think they put dirty tiles in it like this lady was let's say we also put several bond James format and spread of all the doors wide PC you done for you know I mean they're really angry but I really just the you know the hill with a screwdriver and they are really they're kind of like anti Trump present in this day are really\nAh I don't care much for LeBron James that apparently most to Cleveland agrees with me yeah I think now they do\nWe got an email from Tracy about this album ... I Hope it doesn't turn into a controversy the last thing I Would want to see is one of the saints uh players is embroiled in controversy I think it's a little late they already have racy\nUh took it hard she said apparently Alvin come era has decided it did he he would like to make Africa oh McGahn what'd you think is funny because I don't think he was from Africa and honestly I'd be surprised if he could find Africa on a map\nWho's from Georgia we told you earlier but hey you're right about that map to any way since he is solely ... eager to live in Africa I was wondering if you guys would support me if I started to do a ...\nPage to help him get a boat or a plane ticket\nAnd always got the money but he doesn't seem to want to spend his own money go fun to me is the damage you go to go yeah so maybe if we raised the funds for him he will leave immediately and do you like have a presentation to get him to give him the ticket and\nSo what are you guys think I Love you guys by the way she's thanks for me in my life house in the fog loyal to him presenter been listening for just Thirty years or fight house in the log there you go\nWow so how much is a ticket to what it was like I'm not sure I bet they're pretty pricey\nThat well maybe we give them something really nice\nIt is a long way right like Arab like Emirates Airlines are selling really yeah you get a sausage sleeping chamber and I kept rude if I got on that plane I don't care where it landed I probably wouldn't get off the plane yeah wherever it landed is not as nice as inside the plane this\nFlight is going on so I'm going to go where you I'm just staying but\nWhat if they sold your seat to somebody else in the next and leg of the dirty [laughter]\nThey're concerned about the world champion eagles\nThat they're under achieving in this season was a that they'd like to see you know a little more uh uh when I think is what they'd like to see\nOne of the ah sportscasters there in Philadelphia has decided\nThe way that they can get serious about this season is to lay off the women\nGo to ... I think that need to go out of that or not old fashioned wars need to be cut off from these\n[laughter] no [laughter]\nYour mind at\nAll I can speak and I bought I got to tell you because I'm Glad I'm not looking at Philadelphia TV\n... down to that that kind of in Philadelphia that's pretty old advice has been around for a long time [laughter]\n\n\nMe while I'm In the movie theater\n\nYou lay off that shop women we can [noise]\nYeah that is true\nOf the women women weaken leg women take away your legs or is that true mhm mhm oh it's fun and everything but that's your legs are at issue I guess you don't want your legs so that would\nBe assuming that all the other teams that have a beaten the eagles have abstain from sex before they played that's a good question I doubt it Tom\nBrady a I guess he didn't worry about his legs that much because seems to be seems to be doing fine\nAnd you are and yeah I Hope the Astros are laying off the women are going into the series so they got their

it\nCrazy where every now and then you catch a break [laughter] it's crazy well good for them\nIn the meantime other excitement coming your way because hopefully you're not in Florida well in the way of the store the problem is in other parts of Florida yeah I thought they could get away with crime because everybody's going to be paying attention to the storm like the guy in Florida yesterday who used a\nPredator down at the library to try to make some fake money didn't realize that wasn't going to work too good library for it or there's usually likes to do these is a crap but the lab or even a nice print or is not going to get your by with cattle\nHe found a a template on interest to friend bills and decided to give it a whirl I'm Still wasn't very good it was obviously on planes paper quality of he didn't really have a whole specific reason besides he was just trying to\nHave those guys are at the front cash registers got some bills obviously printed out of some of that stock paper you buy Office Depot you don't know if you don't realize about your money it's not\nPaper it's actually cloth Lennon mhm ... printing it on paper even the good kind isn't going to do the same thing if you're the kind of cat\nOr gal that is interested in stuff like a celebrity birthdays or how much weight\nRichard Martin again I was going to say it was the fact that\nIt was more than the first time she'd married the same guy [laughter]\nSo you know they they are called back after ten months they tried it again or or just over a year and then two months later that one ended up going away to cause she got married like four or five more times yeah Liz uh she was a home wrecker today\nOn this day in history\nFuneral services held for the slain Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat he was killed by Islamic extremists are going to give you a multiple choice to make it easy but you jumped right on the Iowa I Know what part of the world that took place says llamas\nExtremists who were angered by his peace agreement with Israel the religion of peace and love didn't care for his peace agreement\nAs going to say the fact that ah you keep going or I'm going well we don't have a peace agreement in the middle east is a will\nThere's you're not going to have one because every time somebody gets one they kill somebody\nSo if I tried to trick you by giving you a false answer like slipped and fell in the bathroom\nYou weren't going to work you wouldn't have gone for your work as well you know we all saw it on the news it actually took place to live on TV this one of those things kind of like the Lee Harvey Oswald uh getting shot by Jack\nRuby out in the hallway I Would have cameras running and they had cameras running on this thing when that when it was a parade a military parade and somebody charged out of the middle east right just shot so that you\nWrite their boat I'm fearing exciting news about the possibility of a fantasy island movie oh Jesus you know you can't wait for them without Ricardo ... well obviously Hervey village as\nThe land boss the plant ... ... unless I could use it\nNow if they use that game of Thrones ... voices too deep it wouldn't work a day in college that wouldn't work\nPizza I don't know who they use\nI don't know who the recall her amount about maybe a\nFresh you know most people living today other than us [laughter] don't remember that show that's true most living human beings don't remember fantasy\nBut they do remember Khan because the number of times it's been replayed on what our trade wars series\nBut I'm thinking uh you know Antonio Banderas is getting up there in age maybe could believe that the new a fantasy island gathering at me something many would probably do it for the ride money ... well they can't come out soon enough for a walk that's for sure oh I'm I'm\nYou know I'm of the real patient on this deal yeah your patient man well whatever something like that kind of thing yeah you take your time all the way that that yeah it's fine I I'm into\nAnd tomorrow it's going to go meet up with President Trump at the White House I don't know if he cares that they will still call it the White House even ... they're they're going to talk about bringing more manufacturing jobs to Chicago\nAnd more job opportunities for former convicts 'cause that's a lot of the people that ... nose and and that also buy here that's also a great deal the population of Chicago that's true\nSo naturally follows suit [noise]\nYeah I'm a pretty Chicago by I might excited about this town you visit to the White House thing about the rest of that too that's huge\nDoes he bring it as a lady and it was old ladies already been up there and she knows a way around she does have you know like oh no the bathrooms right out of ...

buy my old lady\nDetract from a woman's but now I stared at it a lot but I I didn't understand I mean if you want to touch it when you see it but next time let's let mom I get that on video she's got plans we kind of started out of the money you know what I'm saying everything can be turned into money not to mention you're destruction of Christian or around\nMaybe this is worth ... doing is going in 'cause all his Hollywood buddies think he's insane or throwing out with Trump that got him into the White House maybe he's Trojan Horse and yet he's getting in there and then he's going to go after Trump or things inside\nOh wait a minute you don't think they're going to have like nine Secret Service news just surrounded and gone you're you have a way to go into the information shooting a pack and to make sure you don't steal for up to your right now they got patted down like probably about every ten minutes [laughter]\nThey go around and if they're going to be video with a metal detector
