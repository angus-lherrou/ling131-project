Fox has kind of a lefty isn't he\nYeah he is kind of a lead the um you know but he was very good at playing characters\nDid you hear what Peter from Crosby set in the last segment about how they scan and so for those are just tuning in we had a caller in the last segment and pay Peter cool guy talks talks to us on social media sometimes and stuff like that and he had a weird experience where he gave them his um ... was it his ah his ca ca\nCa yeah right I think at the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago exactly the same thing\nSo they stand a card they stop and his his uh his a commercial was that his commercial driver's license or is he is a a a concealed handgun lighting their yeah can you hear me\nAll of a sudden you you went out but yeah the exact\nSame interrupting I\nKnow you're there obviously right so they scan one ID and it and it goes into a database for a different kind of a IDs you could use your commercial driver's license you can use your concealed handgun license you're licensed to carry you can use your uh you know you could pretty much use any\nGovernment are distributed or ID card to vote right and and so that's kinda what's crazy by the way that brings up a great point\nPeople are mad that we have voter ID laws of Texas do you realize how many different kinds of things qualify as a voter id there's a lot seven\nYet because he can use your military ID your passport yeah I Would\nI Would love to know if anybody else out there as having problems like Sandy did our ... like Peter did excuse me give us a call ... won three two one two five nine five zero syndrome are you are you coming in and doing a live in Studio with me this Friday you're going to be here for First Amendment friday\nI Am what's going on on the docket you write anything interesting for the readers people have been asking me I'm\nI'm working on a piece of you know something that happened at the Trump rally on Monday that nobody's talking about and yet if you outlets that are covering it are casting it in in a way that I'm kind of makes you you know really questioned the value of the journalism that we've got out\nThere because you give us a little just a little hint before you release the article\nYeah yeah Trump Trump was talking about uh ten percent middle class tax cut\nA yeah absolutely at\nThe rally yeah and nobody picked this except for a couple of outlet independent like I said the way they're spending it\nPretty interesting\nIn defense of the of the media and you never hear me say that Trump set a lot at that rally you could write an article out of everything\nYou said right but I I\nIn ... and now think something at a policy\nPosition that bold policy condition right there\nI'm totally down with ten percent a tax cuts for the middle class the question is would it\nBe that sweet of a slice of the pie if we don't get a reduction in spending from the government at the same time\nYeah I mean you and I are going to go on that and and that that was another thing that we could go trapped in a cabinet had to cut their department budget five percent\nRight on yeah ... ... or anything of that\nYeah well we we talked about it on the show and we talked about it online and yeah you didn't hear much else you didn't hear much else from the mainstream media 'cause they were more interested in my ...

also blocked by John Cornyn and you know Trump got sued over this\nAnd I think I I think the judge and they appealed it but I think the ... where it stands right now is if you're an elected official you're not allowed to legally block people on Twitter so that is just so you know Senator John Cornyn I have not forgotten about what you did\nYeah and and by the way a something quick you were talking earlier about the voting except my buddy when you're park yesterday he's actually got a total of it hosted online they had an hour and a half line out the door and deer park to vote

years to question do you actually\nBelieve the newspaper le Carr so God they're bleeding at the IRS this morning with this bladder\nAbout well what is it something unhinged not out there what at least Trump supporters are the what was it to all this speculation you know\nDamn well it was somebody in support of ...\nThis is like when you find the N. word spread all over the bar and out on the edge of town right and there was a that was the person that lives there to spray the N. word Obama called the eyewitness new ... new stain became our government I Am a victim\nOh yeah you did that yourself like I said what are the odds this person would send pretty harmless pipe bombs that are pretty much guaranteed not to go off to all kinds of disparate strange addresses where that person is likely not to be and that list would be the who's who\nOf who your average people would select enemies\nOf the Republicans the packages\nWere not actually made all they were intercepted at us for a processing facility none of them have been stamped you know they've gone through the postal than they all had the same return address on them\nThey said that kind of makes them start looking\nAt what's Wasserman debris Deborah Wasserman Schultz says office are of course they looks like they were trying to make it look somebody really smart was trying to make it look somebody really stupid like some redneck mouth breathing ... probably voted for Trump you can\nPut any kind of return address you want on an honorable up to no matter where you're mailer from Disneyland on everything you\nSee it's ridiculous and the fact that they intercepted them all before they got to their destinations and means if there was one tip that sent somebody or these were and the whole thing's been orchestrated\nThey're not even saying for sure that it was an explosive powder they said there was a a powder inside a pipe bomb with I'll watch battery attack and I don't think it was a bomb was supposed to look like one guy this morning\nIt was Obama expert\nLooked at the bombs now of course nobody is given access this is going to be like that Las Vegas thing you're not going to find out what we're going to find out more of the day is because you know you're not because they're covering it up is probably government related is probably a false flag operation set up by Democrats\nAnd the deep state you're not going to it's got to be a kind of like the Las Vegas shooting thing\nThere's gotta be stone wall of stone wall stone along a year later we're still like I had no who did it as can be one of those great mysteries that happened right before the election one of those ... crazy mysteries now one of the ongoing themes you get from these people\nIn these Trump supporters where Trump ... the violent Trump never heard any violence out of the main any Trump supporters you know these violent Trump supporters say they speak\nOf them as if it's a small band hidden away the woods somewhere these Trump supporter [laughter] see five million Americans\nAre Trump supporters maybe more but the way they say it it's like they're all in one\nIn camp out in the woods somewhere ...

idiots to commentators they allow and who's a Democrat\nOr and Democrat leaning which most of the official commentators and CNN and MSNBC or they go and they always said that they go well Trump and his up these Trump supporters\nWhat do you mean Trump supporters you mean the\nPeople that won the election you know by that group of people millions of people that won the election\nThere've been

American ... are coming to their land to rape their mothers and their daughters or other sisters and those are the good things have worked out but if I Will sacrifice my life to stop the horrible Americans from raping my mother now\nIf you watch History Channel it all you know that the early part of the war did not go well for\nUs no we we started slow but we ended pretty good we are right after Pearl Harbor our\nFleet was decimated we struggle to rebuild out in the Pacific ocean and the Japanese\nWere on top they were winning everything early when and all the battles early and then we kind of turned it on I'm kind of like a\nWhen a Drew Brees comes in on the fourth quarter it's got a minute and a half left and suddenly the all American forces are coming in so the Japanese ran out of bullets they ran out of ammunition they ran pilots said killed while their pilots\nAnd so they got all these you really really really young and stupid guys and trained them just enough flying you know how to fly that plane to something\nThey knew how to take off and how to steer the headline eleven guys and they never studied landing no they and they because they weren't going to lay it was ... I think as a matter of fact that's one thing they didn't teach them no landing won't eat it no way to go right into that ship and a lot of missed the ships histories and there were five thousand that you miss\nA lot of guys or did you just flew right over it and crashed into the ocean you hit\nThe ship would be easy with an airplane but when that fire an anti aircraft weapons at your own other airplanes are bearing down on sheen guns and\nTry and shoot you get that first time we kind of put the word out to some of the boys say uh the ... the Japanese aircraft that are coming in they they're going to crash right in the boat so go ahead and take them out of Scott what's the first few times\nThey did it and it was a surprise and then after we knew they were trying to do it it was pretty easy to shoot him now because we knew they weren't skilled pilots like our guys were they were able to shoot I'm like sitting ducks right on this guy\nAnd so it became almost like a black one us pilots said it's almost not fair because these guys can't even fight back they're just trying to fly into the ship so towards the end they didn't get very many but a little less than a history for the wall and Johnson show because\nThey don't seem to teach it at schools anymore oh they teach you now as a you know tiny he's got to daddy and he's not sure what what do you see doesn't know whether he's a boy\nOr girl him decide that those aren't the only two choices either God\nMe back [laughter] last\nWay of fat camp\nOlsen and jumps in radio network James Elizabeth former farms apparently they are indoor gun range now in east of radiation belt way\nFormer firearms dot com we stand behind aren't going to standing in front of them just plain stupid\nOne of our newest sponsorship Walter Johnson program or something that's been in the news a lot lately it's CBD cannabis ... oil I don't know how to say it I just say CBD [laughter]\nYes this stuff is first of all ... life oiled dot com that's where it all starts\nA lot of love rednecks I've replaced those cats with maggots hatched caterpillar isn't getting their their promotions anymore mad guy is doing great magazine cat down because we stop wearing cat\nWhich is really weird ... everybody thought rednecks orange cat hats because they drove caterpillar tractor a no no start wearing cat hats because that was a big spouse sponsor a NASCAR Yes sir and of\nCourse you could pick those up for free or next to nothing in most places I don't know anybody who's ever spent money on that\nNow that's what they call it gave me had and the jury that when you were saying guy wearing a John Deere had already\nAt heart for cat to give them up because that's public ... like you said it's the greatest publicity uh advertising that they you know\nBut you know when you go to the tractors store people you go to the tractors doing well yeah yeah I mean and feeding seed you go to the tractor store a nationwide any location of your the tractor store and they sell these like a John Deere and cat case farm hats\nWhich is a label on and charge you for oh yeah that that people by and I I Know some people buying them and I said the people at the cash register and uh probably got in trouble with little gal doing the checking out the ironic appreciating the help us down there how are you ...
