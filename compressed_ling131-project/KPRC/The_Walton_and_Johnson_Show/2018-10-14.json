out of the house after just being assaulted by two boys at a party\nAnd she was afraid she was going to die she was terrified she was traumatized probably crying and that that that you know just not slinging tears rolling down her face\nShe didn't have a driver's license it wasn't close to her house who drove or home she should be able to testify to who it was she didn't and who ever was should be able to testify about her emotional state moments after\nThe incident happened when they got her in the car is what killed her credibility hand not till you who was and like I said\nI think she really believes her story she she and only she believes her story\nShe knew she fully believes it but here's the problem whoever Doug that out just kinda like dug up a part\nOf it and left the root system all and they didn't give her the background information that she needs to a flea out for the rest of us she named three people\nShe named Kavanaugh's buddy he says neck\nBut it wasn't that new one the other part of the bad day the really the one that really make sure that bad it was her best friend in high school\nThat Leland something under the best friends goes I don't know the Kavanaugh guy and I never met him to do with ah I don't remember that incident I don't remember that party I don't remember that situations\nYou've got to get the feeling from just from the statements that they said she made that she was kind of like backing off going ah\nI don't want to be anywhere near this ms forward woman anymore you know she's not right\nI think she likes her because their friend lifelong friends and she's she ... she said I Believe her in other words she's letting everybody know ...\n... that's what I'm saying she ... don't don't don't I don't want to get too involved with

sit and fat and sassy now for the first time in a long time money wise I'd\nLove to talk to somebody left me question somebody that has been in her class because she did not look intelligent enough to pass on intelligence to another human\nBeing I did hear from one kid that was in a class or she was one of the worst ever got to be\nShe was in sorry but she was just outright stupid about some of the things they asked her do you know what exculpatory do\nYou know the basics of psychology\nWhat does that tell me again\nYou got that Dr put on your name\nWhat a thousand dollars a drop around a lot

hadn't to every\nWelcome to Houston PA Houston's public affairs show high heart media broadcast [noise]\nOur disclaimer said that the opinions expressed on the show do not necessarily reflect those held by this radio station it's management staff for any of its advertisers [noise]\nMy name is Lawrence I Am the Texan from France\nAnd I'm a proud ... and that's why I host Houston PA I like to talk about the\nCommunity and the city which is among the best in the world at\nHelping itself and we're going to talk to a program that is operating a little bit all over the place it is the prison entrepreneurship program or P. E. pi and it's actually gives an opportunity to convict while in prison after prison\nTo come out rehabilitate and reenter\nOur lives all of our society's lives and actually be productive you know go go get a job pay taxes and the un and live a good life Brian Kelly is the c._e._o. of prison entrepreneurship program and within the same ran Gail he has a PEP entrepreneur himself\nA Brian this program is specifically designed to help\nPrison inmates right you start by offering them this opportunity in prison is that right\nThat's correct so we recognize that there are a lot of obstacles in place for men and women coming out of prison and typically nothing has changed since they've been on the inside so we want to\nHelp them empower them to do something different when they get out so it's a inside out program we do uh about nine months of intensive classroom sessions on the inside and then follow up with reentry sport on the outside\nWhat are those classes look like those nine months of education is this a classroom setting the way I Would imagine a classroom when you say classroom I mean\nI Would say that our classroom session is a little more fun\nWhen or if the dog stuff\nAnd it's definitely a captive audience but isn't really a motivated well a captive and that they're oh my gosh\nI let that joke fly right over my head\nAnd they are and we uh we put a classroom together that I'm trying to take as much of the prison out as possible and make it an environment conducive to to growth and fun and excitement and adventure of embarking on a new path\nIs that is that important to to make it funding attractive to the ... is that part of what works with the program\nWe start out by reconstructing uh individuals in the first thing we typically do is deconstruct\nA the self that they've had to put on inside a prison you know it's a pretty tough environments sometimes we put on heart out ourselves to be able to survive on the inside and so the first thing that we do is deconstruct that kind of president persona\nUh one of the ways we do that for guys we give them sweet names that they must I identify with like when I introduced myself ah my name is Brian Kelly but I'm also known as Dorothy\n[laughter] and then there's a way to own that and since I'm from Kansas originally I introduced myself as Dorothy and then uh either saying somewhere over the rainbow or say there's no place like home there's no place like home\nAnd so just a waste of learned to have fun and wholesome way learn to laugh at yourself don't take yourself so seriously but also show that we can reconstruct and do things differently and prison\nSee from my layman's perspective I hear you give us this explanation and I think to myself maybe the reason for this new construction is because\nYou know your typical street thug is greatly driven my ego and this idea you know you don't have any respect for me or or ... and all those things that have become cliches and my the victim of these cliches or is there a lot of truth to that\nOh I think there's a lot of errors that but I think there is also a lot of truth that it's fair\nYeah oh yeah a lot of my ego is\nSure I've put up my Hollywood front so you don't pick behind it and so we want to deconstruct that so that we can get to the heart of the matter and reconstruct in solve it was build a foundation and build a a individual up into somebody that he did or she didn't even think they could be\nIn by reconstructing what do you mean I mean is this what the course is it do you actually teach them about basic manners and ways of addressing people and respectful ways or is it yeah you're nodding so is that you start with the very basics basically what parents should have taught them\nYou know we have two phases to our nine month program the first three months we call phase one or leadership academy and we really start with the foundations of what it's like to live an honorable life\nAnd so you know a lot of times I have had thirty forty fifth year old man came up to me and say we're the minute that we're supposed to teach me this when I was young I needed this then and I'm like yeah me too\nBut you have it now and you can convey that to your son or daughter or your grandkids or somebody else's kid a but it's not through like\nYeah I think it's one of the most important parts of the program is the first three months you know character development is really important not only for nor is looking to start their new businesses on the outside but just overall\nOn living a good life you know I'm being brought up you know a lot of times um\nPeople in urban areas and stuff like this aren't taught you know morals ethics values they don't know with with what these are so a P P. doesn't very good job of instilling these\nIn us and I'm hoping as progress as we go\nSam you're an entrepreneur or did you start a company or did you join in with others\nUm I started a company and I joined in with others as well so what what company did you start um my company's uniform enterprise is a little si una pro enterprises El Al ... yes or a United professional yeah\nSo I'm I'm a real estate a entrepreneur so I built back homes and flip out these serious or\nThere's a lot of money in that market if you do it well this is normally I mean this and this is one of those things the entry level\nIs actually something that you can what Brian you tell me that the real estate is something that is so concrete that it is eminently teachable\nAnd even though for someone who doesn't have any business act you meant it might seem completely out of reach\nIt feels like one of those really good topics that you can kind of bring down it's like whoa wait a minute you know if if if you have the power of gab you can probably sell something and therefore you can sell the house [laughter] but is that ... is that part of what you're looking for his programs that do these sorts of\nUh businesses I guess I Want to mention that there's a\nThere's more than two hundred and eighty businesses that have been started by P. E. pi\nActually allow over three hundred and sixty\nWow oh he's an old numbers that I'm dealing with who sent me this stuffed Rachel Compton [laughter]\nBy the way thanks to Rachel Compton it used to be with Elmo public relations are great public relations firm in town she is now and also pursuing an NBA which will actually give her the power\nTo serve organizations like prisoner interpreters are programmed even better but she volunteers with this program and that's how they're on the show to get another example of stone in entrepreneurship and and kindness\nYou are listening to Houston PA Houston's public affairs show my name is ... and my guests are here to represent the prison entrepreneurship program or P. E. pi by the way they're online WWW dot\nP. E. P. dot org P. E. P. dot org by\nWay women obviously there are two men in the studio representing the program but are there are women at the has to be a separate branch of the program since obviously men and women are segregated and prison\nSo pi pi has been in existence for about fourteen years and we just recently started a program for women over close to Austin at la carte Texas we started last fall and us far there's just been tremendous response by the ladies as Lockhart\nThat has said that one hundred percent of the graduates from the program find a job within three months in other words they get out of the program and they find a job and the overwhelming majority is close to a hundred percent are still employed after twelve months\nYeah we've done a lot of a ... a data analysis along those lines and ah actually right now our average of getting somebody a job coming out of prison is about Seventeen Days and that's at a rate of about twelve sixty an hour a third survey work we have found that at the three year mark\nTypically are released graduates are making around fifty grand a year and forty two percent will own their own home so we have empower them to do something different to earn a livable wage and to live live\nJust like a good next door neighbor\nSo your program works I mean why doesn't every prison had a massive PEP program\nThere are programs and and other states and other jurisdictions that are clamoring to have is there and work currently evaluating our business model and prepare for replication and other states and expansion within the state you know we've got a product or the works and we want to share that\nAnd empower others to get out and a little bit transform law\nAnd a one last number which I think is also very impressive\nIs that nationally the recidivism rate is around fifty percent in other words you released two convicts one of them is coming back and you're recidivism rate for people who have gone through the prison entrepreneurship program to seven percent\nThe thing is is you show person a different way of doing something me I spend Eighteen years I'm In a fast lifestyle selling drugs I'm doing all kinds of illegal things and once I had somebody who actually taught me that there was a different way\nThat he was as good as it was\nBecause the critics\nJohn was one of the first celebrities to use the same to promote conservation\nYou formed affirmed friendship with legendary French naval officer in underwater explorer ...

your first impressions when you heard this\nWell it is refreshing and that's the key word there because so many couples get tied up and not literally about planning a wedding that is there to you know media than a dream of somebody for a long time but\nUltimately when that wedding has done and they're spending an average at thirty five thousand on a wedding now in America I'm\nOn a second W said thirty five thousand is the average\nYes that's the average kid doesn't include our biggest city like New York at Seventy eight Chicago at sixty and LA at forty four\nBut you know the reality is most couples are standing around ten grand\nThat is the goal but for some folks have huge stretch and have couples that are having two hundred gas or so that is a big responsibility and let me tell you one that's done in the honeymoon is over your reality is going to sat in\nOn this is a commitment I made for the rest of my life and what do I have to shop and letting the odds of pictures some great memory absolutely those are all things that are important but what did you do financially that's just that you had or back\nAt the starting line of your marriage\nAnd and do you know coming into the marriage this first crisis point I actually think the wedding is the first crisis point\nAnd so if you to learn how to negotiate through that crisis point my wife and I did it fast like this we did a cheap\nBecause we just said we are not encouraging debt to go into the future of our life and as you as we've talked about the finances is one of the key strains on a marriage\nWhat a crazy way of what a crazy precedent to set for your marriage how are you going to handle other crisis point the first house comes up you want to keep up with the Joneses she got a house you can't afford so on and

financial points become because from a car\nTo our house and to vacations wearing how we spend our money on those three things can lead to financial ruin or the financial health than we know what happens to marriages that are financially healthy they have a better shot\nYeah they do and that you're on the same page for those things so I'm going to challenge folks that are listening\nTo hey yes habit designer wedding or one that fits your pocketbook\nYour lifestyle and your calls that's an important lesson\nBut also have the designer marriage so many people go into the act of getting married that they don't consider how their relationship stages that and really no one where the other person is that when you make that let's face it business decision for life\nYou would not go into a partnership with the business without checking out the other person's motives and goals\nFirst and then no one that other per person it's at and that you're on the same page\nWhy would you go into a lifelong commitment for marriage and not check things out\nI Believe that a lot of people that have a great great love for each other that don't take the time to do the double checks before they walk down the aisle and don't you want to know that you know that you know why you're marrying that person the good the bad and the ugly the things that really helps us identify none of us are perfect\nBut I Am willing and ready to make that commitment to that individual\nCome hell or high water because this is my person that I'm going to teen with\nFor the rest of my life and I love this person let's not forget about that the second you throw the wedding ring engagement ring I'm Sorry on your finger\nIs the second most couples turn off the relationship building power and go into action now that I got to get this thing and this and this and you'll see it with a lot of bright they just go into the zone sometimes with their their mothers that they just get so involved in the wedding they forget about their relationship\nThey come to the day and that Brian is on one end of the aisle or the you know wherever you are getting married at and the group that the other\nAnd she's going or he's going oh my gosh I Hope this works and if you think you're thinking that right now when you're planning your wedding you need to stop\nAnd make sure you have a coach that can come along side you and to some of that premarital poaching that is so so important I always say prepare and enrich is one of the number one ways in thirty minutes that you can find out where your strength areas are and we're challenge areas are\nYou as a couple can go through this lesson plans of six weeks know where you're at knowing exactly how you're going to use the tools um relationship on this to build your relationship so you can have the relationship\nAnd so I went over there and we got together and sure enough he was on responses and I literally saw that\nIn any minute they were going to tell me he's gone\nTill the next morning\nAnd so then I I get right outside their house and I finally get attacks from Pam and she says daddy's sitting up in the bad eating breakfast [noise]\nAnd so I said well would it be okay for me to come in and visit with him and she said absolutely please come and so I went in the house and they took me back to the bedroom and there he was sitting up in the bed finishing a McDonald's biscuit that somebody brought to it [noise]\nAnd then after he finished those biscuits they said where's my donor\nAnd he shared a donor and a cup of coffee with me one of the first things he said to me was Jeff I Need you to do me a favor I Need you to tell Larry stay gay that I'm probably not going to be at my post Sunday Morning [noise]\nAnd I said Mr Earl I'm not going to tell area thing [noise]\nBecause what I saw yesterday at what I see the day you're liable to be there on Sunday Morning\nWell he had the last word on that and he was right let me ask you how many people do you know are getting approved for serving with children when they are eighty three years old\nOr all did\nTwo thousand fourteen just three years ago at eighty three he signed up to serve in our children's ministry sports camp and then in April of of this year at eighty six years of age Earl venture responded to the color of our church to make room in his heart\nFor more people\nAnd he did so by signing up eighty six years old by signing up to serve on our greeter team and less than two weeks before he died he was at his post\nIn a scooter\nAt the equipping hall entrance making people feel welcome does a cane for warship\nPearls hardest service well marked his entire life but folks this is not\nJust something that Earl had learned to do in his old age\nAs a younger man when ... was located old spillway road is pastor said many times he would take his lawn more up to the church and for years he mowed the grass at the church\nHe was known by the children there is the candy man as they knew that he had some sweet treats in his pocket and whenever they came to church he would always blessed them with some candy and I've thought a lot about the way that oral Fincher\nSir\nAnd it occurred to me that there were\nTwo qualities of his life and they're going to have to be two qualities of any person's life is going to be devoted to serving others quality number one\nIs he has surrendered his surrender [noise] I remember the story\nOf when king David was about to die and he was about the hand the kingdom over to his son Solomon the last word some of the last instructions that David gave to Solomon and first chronicles chapter twenty eight burst nine word this\nAsk for you my son's Solomon no the God of your father\nAnd served him with a whole heart and wailing mind to serve\nGod with the whole heart into willing mind implies that you've already surrendered\nTo God to let him lead your life and so I asked are all on Tuesday Morning\nOr when did you open your heart to Jesus when did you surrender your life to Jesus Christ and Earl shared with me it happened when he was about junior high school age\nAnd he told me that he a turn for ... and he had trusted Christ as a savior needed surrender do is is life and folks have is about Seventy three years ago\nWhen are all committed his life to Jesus Christ and so if you do anything for Seventy three years chances are you're going to get pretty good at it\nJeff shares the second quality ... had it helped him serving others\nBut there was a second quality needed if you're going to serve others and that is\nSelflessness of selflessness\nAbout you serving others doesn't always happen when it's convenient for you [noise]\nServing others doesn't always fit in with your time schedule\nOr when you think it ought to take place\nFirst Peter for ten reminds us to use whatever gift we have received to serve others\nWhatever give the Holy Spirit has given us where do you use that give to employ it in service to other people and to do this requires an attitude that says put others first Karen\nShared with may just the other day that she could never remember a single time in her life when she needed her daddy [noise] and she let him know and he wasn't on his way to help her\nHe was always making sure that he did everything he could\nTo serve into bless his family he was a hard worker Jordan is oldest granddaughter shared dish she said in her twenty nine years\nHer granddaddy showed up at every recital every ball game or anything his grandkids were involved in and then it didn't start with that generation his great grandkids can say the same thing with him just about a week\nBefore he died when he was so sick or I was sitting at the ballpark cheering his Joshua on in his baseball game selflessness\nYou finished off of what I Would have desired for those and his service\nThan a very real sense Pearl didn't want this to happen [noise] they said just let you and say come and pick up my body and let that be done [noise] he didn't want to have this gathering and I told the family this isn't for him this\nIs for you [noise] but I Believe that if some way Earl could speak to us right now he would say this don't make a fuss about me tell everyone about my Jesus [noise]\nHe's the one who made my life worth living you see are all knew the joy of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and that would be ... desire for you today\n[noise] so I close [noise] than as not close [noise]\nI'd like to read the scripture the family chose for today they sent this to me in a text on friday [noise]\nSecond Corinthians chapter for the two versus if they chose on the screen first seven but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from\nGod and not from a U.S\nEverything that our own did every way that he ever serve every gift he ever gave every project he ever tackle it wasn't it was the power of God and working through him [noise]\nAnd there you have a ... a girl singer ... ... the guy next door [noise] but not really a surrender and selflessness hard work and always showing up\n[noise] always being there for the kids then the grandkids and the great grandkids and this is our American stories real ... story ...\nBut we try to do is get within ten to Fifteen degrees of the ambient temperature so if it's a hundred degrees outside\nWe don't want the temperature being all say over a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen degrees if it is hotter than that them we'll look at doing solar ventilation may be some soft investigate air into the addict or we have to get the editor temperature down and there's different ways to do that and that would come out and do an addict analysis will come on look at the addict and you don't see an argument that do you when you come out you know\nSo that kind of our first stage so people you know listen to the show today you can call 'em will throw it up you know we've got some deals on some insulation as well but call us will come out and look at the addict and see what it actually needs 'cause it's it's hard to even just say you know old just in general over well installations which in ... well not necessarily people will say my air conditioner is not working anymore for young\nWell that may be the case could be but maybe not so you know what you can do the best thing is is have somebody come look at it so ... been doing this for Thirteen Years we know what we're doing and we don't oversell people would just see what they need it would come out and we would take care of it\nI'm going to give out Tom's number as to eight one nine three six zero five five nine to eight one nine three six zero five five nine Tom is the owner of attic innovations he has actually come out to my home put insulation in put a solar addict fan in and you also put the draft master and that's what you call it\nDon't you you had to drop master the addict stairway and later it's for the poll downstairs and it just keeps the heat in cold\nIt really works great in the summer and it works just as well in the winter so if you're eating the house and heat rises so you don't want it that heat to just go right up to that addict or ... votes in insulator that will insulate then it's part of like when we do insulation it's actually insulating the door so it's really part of the insulation package and as he calls today will do will throw one of those in which is what the purchase of insulation\nAbsolutely fantastic to eight one nine three six zero five five nine on the today show top medic innovations is going to be talking about\nAddict insulation we're going to be talking about solar addict fans and radium barrier radiant barrier also is actually good for the winter a lot of people think that must be a summer thing because there isn't that bounce the the sun's energy back out again right so we'll be talking about that here on the show before the break\nLet's talk about a deal you brought you always come to the show with a deal because you know that I check a pro Joe require it so I hang Tom upside down by his ankles I shake him the problem with that is Tom's a couple of inches tall and\nYeah you always begging my head and if you can visualize that sort of grants among my ankle checks and bang bang bang [laughter]\nOkay so are you bought a deal ordinarily it's a dollar Ninety per square foot for an eight inch ad of blown in certain seat installation the white stuff right yeah um and and so that's a that's deep eight inches and that's generally what people need to get up to the our values and our ...\nYear so not most houses are going to have five to six inches in there that hasn't been upgraded so will come in and that's what we find that's all you're on that special on eight inches that normally we'll bring you to Thirteen fourteen inches when that'll be a really nice job uh we used it certainly insulation doesn't its its costs say fire rated uh\nIt's doesn't absorb moisture mold doesn't grow on it it's a great insulator and we can add that to the existing inflation so you don't have to pull the old insulation out\nNow we do remove all if it's you know something that you've had squirrels and it's nasty but normally we don't need to do that Ninety five percent of the time we're just going to add insulation to what you have\nBut that is something that we do um but we don't encourage that and push that on people some some places will say every house that they got what we were we pull everything out every town now he's like you're spending your charging their customers so much money you might have been a job that was maybe a Fifteen hundred dollar job and they're like oh we got twelve thousand or that jump like\nKeep it that customer didn't need that that's if you need it you need it but in most cases you know that's crazy we don't operate like that\nWhen you're painting a room you don't scrape the paint off you know ... rocket you don't actually you just go over it to eight one nine three six zero five five nine one dollar Ninety cents a square foot for an eighty and chat it's fifty percent off today everybody half price only Ninety five cents is that correct\nYou're Ninety five cents a square foot but they didn't shed and there were also throwing in the freezer Wayne Slater of the draft ... I've got one I Love it yep and those are only two Ninety nine installed and she made right here in Colorado, Texas so it's a really a nice ... ... people so we kind of use the local\nYou know products and try to support our local community with by doing that and it's a great product\nThat is huge two hundred and nine nine dollar value for the addict stairway until later the draft master I Love that product because I'm ... and we've talked about this before time here on the show\nIf you don't have anything on your stairway door and you pull it down for instance and you look up that is just there but when you close it it has\nWhat a quarter inch of plywood there that's less than an are one value they're very very low are ... you're going to throw that in for free so if you want a free addicts are way insulator in fifty percent off addict insulation from attic innovations\nHome out or how many callers today can we uh we can do six six deal today to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you don't need this now don't clog up the phone lines because we've got people listening who want it [noise] call now six people only to wait one\nNine three six zero five five nine if you didn't get the number we're going to repeat it during the break in time when we come after the break a would remind me I Will offer the okay to wait one nine three six zero five five Ninety six colors only when we come back talking more of an addict insulation radium barrier and solar addict than\nCheck a pro Joe here how does your front door look does it need to be refinished I've got a deal for you my friends over it's dirty door refinishing is offering a fifty dollar off deal\nOn your front door refinishing ordinarily three hundred dollars now only two hundred and forty nine dollars it's a special check a pro deal and it's a limited time offer sturdy doors re finishing his authorized me to give away five of these deals today right now\nToday on my radio show the first five callers will get fifty dollars off their front door refinishing it's only two hundred and forty nine dollars you must call right now to eight one three seven seven for nine four or five\nGet your front door looking brand new without buying a brand new door fifty dollars off color right now to wait one\nThree seven seven for nine four or five that's too late one three seven seven forty nine forty five call now\nHoney I Love our new home but it seems work\nJust go to check it for a look at what you mean by category this I frequent fire service we qualify she wrote checks references on all its members\nOkay let's say home remodeling rivers garage door repair and landscapers I Do all the companies right from the profile\nThat must be chicken ... from\nA sea repair to window replacement check it throws your source for pre qualified service providers\nYou want to without one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree jak approach ... what are each month to enter the one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree contest just emailed jak approach Joe ...

[noise] some attic innovations here on the check a pro radio show I was listening to one of those motivational speakers\nOn you to the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that\nToo oh I get a kick out of those guys yeah yeah well you name it kind of jazz me up every once in a while when I'm feeling blue but gets you thinking yeah\nAnd so someone was talking about having a purpose okay and my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day is I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner finds the best possible contractor so on check a pro dot com we've check their licenses insurance some references all one hundred plus contractors\nAnd is also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner\nI'm you're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need it you're not going to cut all home the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that month I'm right exactly it's actually you're kind of like a doctor I go to the addict doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem\nAnd then you say what do we have to do as far as an operation\nPacemaker [laughter] ... none of ours is [laughter] and and and so then you might recommend you know you need to fans and this is why and you have a rationale for ... um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe you need ten and this is why\nI'm you need a radium barrier because you were in the primaries of Katy, Texas and you're getting\nBeaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house and you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nThe nice thing as soon as what we do that it's a lifetime of energy savings and comfort so everything that we do it's not some you have to do over and over again so if you do the writing a barrier that's a one time deal or if you do solar fans are fans have a lifetime or two so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come to replace the fan\nThe insulation is guaranteed to settle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say well I'm In a remodeled my kitchen for something like well ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen aid remodeled again because it's out of date\nIt goes out of style insulation in what we do never goes out of style nobody ever says boy you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nBecause they want it to you know what I'm saying it's like you want it to be as efficient as you can eat on it you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient addict you don't want to go back you realize what a difference it's really made 'cause I get calls all the times like well do you really think\nYou know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation is going to make it a big difference and like you ma'am you only have two inches of in oh why is going to be huge now if you already had Fifteen inches of inflation is somebody trying to tell you you need eight more and then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference now is up and make a big difference because you're already you're already there\nBut if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be\nIs it is going to make a big difference in the lower temperature it it does make a big difference in the house like I said it makes it more comfortable\nAir conditioners going to run less lower energy bills\nThe house can be quieter what's more insulation it's good pizza mind just knowing that everything is the way it's supposed to be I'm kind of into that people say what do you mean peace of mind is like well you just know that it's it's correct you go to sell the house\nYou're not would like to ... somebody in and saying well here's a house is great and you know my my gosh the wiring shot the addicts horrible the air conditioners on its last legs you don't want to sell somebody that something like that it depends\nOn their desperate situation you might need\nI guess maybe if but see that's why you get stuff taken care of as you go in and do it right like I say I was in the house yesterday and we were doing a removal and they were so happy and they're like you know what we were just going to add some inflation there\nBut the old stuff smelled so bad there that are like you know what let's just do it right I see yeah 'cause what happens if we come here and put ten inches of inflation in here and it still smells because you didn't pull the old stuff and then we have to take everything back out all that installations junk\nSo you spend all that money and now we're gonna have to go ahead and do it right so let's just do it right the first time\nAnd they agreed we did the job and they were ecstatic I mean so that's that's how we do things and we just won't do it right the first time were very reasonable and we'll make and we always say will make it work so really no matter what people's budgets are will work something it doesn't have to be because we can do in stages we could do inflation now maybe a solar fan later\nUm if you want to do them all together and maybe we'll give you a little bit bundle all deal but we try to make things work so that's that's how we do it\nTom and his team will come out for free do a free attic analysis here's this number to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly six people were able to get the addict insulation deal that we talked about earlier in the show we might circle back later and maybe Tom we'll throw in a few more of those deals but for now that's done but if you're interested in having a free addict analysis\nAnd radiant barrier because I Want to go into that next and Tom has a deal to eight one nine three six zero five five nine radium barrier it's a great product to have\nWhen you don't have protection on your roof if you've a dark roof like I Do it's getting beaten all day long and it is absorbing heat you want that hate to be reflected back out radium barrier can do that [noise]\nDom brought a deal and I'm going to talk about the deal now then you have Tom go into radio barrier more depth [noise] this is a great deal it's a low two dollars per square foot but Tom is offering fifty percent off and it's only a dollar a foot that's crazy ... square foot\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before someone as a two thousand square foot house and his two stories\nTheir attic is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet exactly so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the rabbit can they can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah will measure it because most people have kind of an idea I think it's about twelve hundred feet or or whatever is in like OK and will measure it and it's like yeah sure enough that's right I'm just kind of the normal will just come out with a quick measure make sure where everybody on the same page and we'll get on the exact price would give them the quote right on the spot\nA so we don't say whoa email to you and then in two weeks you finally get it and all that kinda stuff will give you the price right there in ... so you know right where you stand\nAnd that way you can say you know while the radiant was say say the radio was twelve hundred and the inflation was a thousand and you you could say well I could I could do one or the other which one do you think would be best and then we can make a decision and we can talk over the options the pros and cons of of each so that's why I like to give prices right on the spot so people know where they stand and they can make an educated decision\nVersus just saying if I just emailed them over all the pricing later\nThen but they they don't know which way to go because\nWe're not there and we can't really talk about it and yeah it's better to get it out and we'll sit down even if it takes an hour to to go over well we'll talk to you and we'll figure it out most of our appointments really led to take about thirty to forty five minutes will come up in the attic\nTakes maybe ten minutes ago everything we have him in if you want to chit chat and you know give us cookies or something will will do that too but it doesn't take long to do this process we're not there to keep\nYou know banging on your ... and making you want to buy something I had a a company come out one time they were trying to sell me\nA some stuff from my house and they were there for four hours like this is ridiculous and just like what are you guys doing it's like\nThey don't let them do or our I I you know he didn't say yes that's why they're there for four decades kept saying no it's like you know I think that people said well we're going to think about ... I'm going to talk to my wife when she gets home I'm like great does fine let's let me know if she has any questions give me a call it I'll give you my cell phone number and we'll just you know I'm happy to I'm happy to leave for like your your call me back\nAnd we're just confident we're going to get the business of the customers actually going to do an addict\nJob we're going to get to work because our reputation is still solid\nFifty percent off the radiant barrier today he block ultra\nIt's not two dollars today that's normal price but here on the check a pro radio show for my listeners is only a dollar per foot dollar per square foot fifty percent off to wait one nine three six zero five five nine how many of these are you giving away today\nI'm laughing because at the same time my doctor said you're shrinking so I guess some things to go down you know I my ... you're not shrinking yet but but the point is if you live to be long enough you're shrink\nI went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and I said you've lost twenty pounds is twenty Fifteen I'm like oh ... I wasn't even trying to lose any way but you know these addicts are hot it's tough on you know if ten more years I'll be twenty less [laughter] solar\nAddict fans a great deal from the federal government Uncle Sam is giving you thirty percent off what a\nYeah so you get thirty percent off of the of the installed price so you get thirty percent of the product and the installation so it really helps bring the cost down or I go over the numbers real quick and then I'll talk about the benefits of the fan\nSo we do a thirty ... solar addict fan it's made by the people like I said they're out to Colorado, Texas I'm a thousand Ninety five dollars is the normal or normal installed price were taken two hundred dollars offer ... nurse\nSo it brings it costs down to eight Ninety five out the door installed\nLifetime warranty the whole kitten caboodle so that's a great deal but then the government's also kicking in thirty percent federal energy tax credit to get thirty percent of that back on your twenty Eighteen taxes so that the two hundred and sixty dollars and fifty cent tax credit so brings the total cost to six twenty six fifty after the tax credit\nSo just to be clear of the day we do the the fan it would be eight Ninety five\nOf to edit innovations and then you'll get to sixty eight fifty back in the tax credit so your your true out of pocket expenses six twenty six fifty so the nice thing about that is these fans can pay for themselves in a year or sometimes even less just in energy savings because I've had customer say you know I have\nFour hundred dollar electric bill now my bill is like two fifty in such a big difference in the summertime that that they get paid for itself to for summer it's incredible so the fans are really nice ours has um humidity sensor and the farmers that comes on eighty five degrees\nSo it doesn't pull heat on your attic in the winter it's it's smart technology but it will it can kick in in the winter if you have high humidity in run for Fifteen or twenty minutes pulled the humidity down\nIn ... and you don't want a lot of humidity in the addict is because it can get in Indian inflation and then the installation starts to settle and then later on you need more inflation the whole reason was because you maybe didn't have enough to start with but if you did have enough you had too much humidity the

our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWell we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium\nYour heart won't beat who very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with that what happens is that you need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it\nReally because it relaxes your body needs to actually feel the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches\nThere's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency spin the nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nNow what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting 'em ... muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest it\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it gets it a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you

problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what does it used for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay\nAnd that

health\nBut I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it all messed up\nWell why do you say that why is it messed up\nWell first of all do you go to your doctor and they got a quick out of vitamin D supplements and it's like four hundred international ... which is totally worthless or God Forbid if you're listening right now and you're taking a multi vitamin and you'd think

formula is a fast enough tablet that's available for immediate absorption\nYou know you mentioned the vitamin D is an oil so how were you able to make your formula into a fast melt\nWell good question Critz here's what I've done\nI've worked with an advance team of scientists and these guys they know their stuff and they're using that technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder and once they do that they put it in this vast dissolving melt for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr bank is from people

the issue is even\nIf you're trying to get vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all of the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D\nThe fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from sun\nWhat makes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet they can actually feel the different second I use the right type of vitamin D and my formula\nYour sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like the only in a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that way and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of result to be seen\nWell one of the surprising one was that gave it to my brother in law who had gone to his doctor and was very concerned about his cholesterol blood fat and his weight and I put him on my vitamins these three and he went back in three months later and his blood profile is perfect\nAll right I Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that again if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there is a special toll free number for you to call right now it's one eight hundred for seven six five three zero to\nYou know as we've been talking about here Dr ... vitamin D three formula is a fast dissolving melt which makes it available for immediate absorption by your body for rapid results and by getting Dr ... says vitamin D three into your body\nYou're going to have a bolstered immune system improved balance stronger muscles and

six five three zero two\nPlus if you call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend but you must call

eight hundred for seven six five three zero to\nSo how about if folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D\nThree is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end as going up and out through the roof where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and\nVitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling that her you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on the formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and I May of clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your fast melt the three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath on in the mirror in the morning and then you know that you're a candidate for this\nBecause a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that and the sooner you can get on my formula the better I you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here I Know\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting just working someone expect when they start taking your fast melts the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something changing in your body because the kick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less Shane having more energy\nAnd having better mental clarity better sleep your moods can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to get these things running\nWell Dr biggest slum fortunately we only have a few minutes left anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final

you to\nTry something to see if it works it's a it's an interesting thought or doing we're talking about nutrition we're not talking about rocket science here right a lot of science\nBehind what I'm Talking about the key is to get on this formula and give it a month or two every day take one of the set and start the improvements and you're paying your blood pressure your blood sugar energy your

denies the charges Florida Senator Marco Rubio says if the allegations are true Congress will take swift action\nAre not only do we want more participation but we want more participation for some of the some of the smaller shops or some of the independent creative uh I Believe we were at a one Seventy five before we're now to down to one and a quarter for an entry\nAnd again we want people to participate we don't want to feel like it's an exclusive club\nRight yeah that's the idea so I'm Glad to see the change and I and I hope that reflects in a great audience for the upcoming Audi awards as well\nYou have the opportunity to bump into someone who is iconic here in Houston market bill by us a\nIs a a news anchor who has a really really done such a great job of sending through the ranks and is now a primetime anchor ah but you actually had the opportunity I guess in this past week to to hear him speak about a media talk about that a little bit you know\nIt was a it was a great lunch and it's the media alliance has their lunch in once a month at the health club and it was um the luncheon was based on diversity and they had a folks there from um [noise]\n... ah I call it radio one it's a urban one now now with a morning show a we have some Spanish station some Univision folks there as well as a media by or from the parade and a bill by and so he\nBecame the keynote speaker or it was a roundtable discussion but he became the keynote his view of the city since he's been on the air since Nineteen Seventy five and the changes he's seen in diversity you know he talked about that when he was coming up on the ranks uh it was primarily a\nWhite male um dominant the\nOn air personality that's what it was sure and the you know that that changed\nBecause the um\nMedications industry said you know you ... you're you're on air personalities must mirror the look of the population but he he talked about some of the challenges in in that time period and the biases\nOr that people had but\nMore importantly I think that that and I was told by numerous people that were at the lunch and\nThen it was one of the best lunch and he talked about that the um\nThe divide today in our country specifically that you have to mediums you have a liberal medium and a conservative medium or you know there's the CNN's of the world and then the box of the world and that he feels that it's really a is escalating how people\nAre aren't comfortable up or I Would say not comfortable um that that we are dividing our country because now you can you you don't have a choice of one network where you feel\nI'm getting the the true story although he he didn't say that one or the other but there's there's a slant yeah and um he felt that that that is really bad for our country\nThat he called it the tipping point that he doesn't see us going back\nTo the Walter Cronkite the of the world that we reach this this time period we're now we're gonna have to uh our political views are going to be based on what what television or network we watch\nWow you know that probably might have existed even back in the seventies when he was there but to a lesser extent or but it certainly seems to me that the folks in in the television industry and the communication industry have responded to a well specifically Houston's diversity I mean look at what to\nLook at who we have on a year now a very good representation I think of a lot of folks and hopefully a truthful a representation without bias that's a tough thing to do though isn't it\nYeah uh you know I yeah obviously the uh the local news that they're not going to have as much biased because again it's local news now and that's what he talked about a there was one interesting point they may do or they were talking about the what are the common languages and um\n[noise] the schools today and you know you would have thought okay English Spanish and um Mandarin and it was an English Spanish and Mandarin was English Spanish and Arabic ... which tells you a lot about the diversity\nOf of this\nUm of this city you know there are sixty at least sixty countries represented in this city today so it is a extremely diversity and yes you're right you can see it in our anchors um when he look when you look at the local news\nYeah dancing to doing a good job we've got a great city here and and then as soon as I said uh it is one of the most diverse cities in the country I Believe we're ten years out of LA in that regard so this is a fun time to be in a in media and marketing and advertising isn't it\nIt is it is it's a it's definitely a\nOn a daily basis you know you you obviously you have the you know they also talked about the the change with a TV viewing\nWhere do you do is talking about one of his sons in college to the shows up at the dormitory she was one of the Spanish speakers was probably about shows up at the don't dormitory but he says where's your TV where's your stereo and he pointed to the smartphone [laughter]\nYeah that's the way it's going folks and a lot to be broadcast and screw them out and do a good job responded to the TV is\nNo longer am\nTelevision is the way we saw was nowhere to extension of our computer where we watch Netflix and Amazon and in lieu and whatever so it's all stream not at all screaming but so much of a ... street though\nAll bucks to convenience
