old\nIs about the same age as I Am and I'm not on\nHis name is Keith all spelled it gay Mr oh\nDirector of educational technology an exhibit development for the children's museum of Houston there on line to see him Houston dot org ... seat in Houston dot org and you're going to be interested in this if you have kids\nBecause I don't think that there was a better place to celebrate Halloween in Houston they're actually having trick or treat everyday for instance so you don't actually have to go on Halloween to do that\nIt's actually it kind of extra curricula Larry program where you can do Halloween on Halloween you can also go to the children's museum and do it and prepare so that you're really up for it on the day of but in all honesty uh it's been a few years since I've seen them using when they've picked it up for Halloween but I have seen it\nAt the museum is at first all of a ... day\nIf we can call them that one of the nicest installations in town it's like a beautiful movie set it reminds me of the experience you get when you go to Disney World and I know that I'm comparing to things that are not in the same price range the entrance to the museum is free on Thursday afternoons All right\nBut that's how beautiful and will calculate the experiences it's a climb on touch everything type amusing for the kids\nThe sets really are beautiful they have a ton of technology built into all of these exhibits and there's this awesome ... tower in the middle of the amusing which adults can also climates perfectly safe when you see it you realize that uh the kids can't fall off their ropes and all that it's a ton of fun though because you're right on the edge of a precipice\nAnd there's flow works out so outdoors I'm naming my favorite installations here by the way\nForward is one of the coolest I Would call it an art is stick insulation because of how cool and beautiful it is\nIt's just a bit of engineering to catalyze water and to teach kids how we can damn rivers create lakes or change the flow of water and help them to understand just how powerful it is and how inevitable it is and you know if you live in Houston you know that the water gets around\nUnfortunately so Keith all spelled Mr oh he's also the geeky as to the gates and we're trying to find a Latin word for geek ... or something he ... he used to call yourself the resident mad scientists which I was in love with I was like I Want that job\n[laughter] door I'm Still doing much Mad Science that we're doing around there right now I'm busy working up a bunch of different slime recipes for us to do in preparation for Halloween preparation for how long you're already decked out though right where we're totally act that we've got all kinds of things have gotten brand new pieces this year every year we tried to add a little bit more on\nSo this year we have a brand new scream machine so kids can go inside to see just how loud they can scream and it's it's it's not sound proof that sound resistance so we can definitely hear it but it's not like having your kids scream right next to use this was a great place to stick them and\nLet them screaming out and walk away get a coffee comeback trust me they'll still be in there screaming and it gets you see just how they are ...\nDecibels does it that's the bill meter there's one called the ... the instrument there's less of all made up or [laughter]\nSo it's not like a dominant or which tells you how fast you're engine is revving that's a cool name just something that doesn't sound like what it does so this is like a ... tells you how loud you had the desert on me to somebody on the other hand the kids are learning about ...\nDecibels to learn about how sounds are generated and of course they're just having a great time screaming their heads off and then we have another cool piece this year that we haven't cuts called getting a head and if you've ever seen the classic you know ...\n... peace where there's just a head sitting there or they take away someone's body and the ... then then the phrases it's like it's all done with mirrors this is the basis for that it's called the ... solution\nSo we have a mirror placed just so and if you go there you can actually see exactly how the mirrors place and you go and you get behind it go underneath and you can have your head inside a lab jar and the mad scientist lab peace and it was a great photo op it looks like just your head sitting there\nOn a table hollow I understand so to the new movie trick it's an old it's an old theater trek yeah ... first started this was the very first one called the swing solution that utilized a mirror to hide the fact that there is a hidden compartment under the table so it looks like it's just totally open table\nAnd you can see straight through you can see four legs it looks like there's no way there's a body there but there is we don't actually had anyone at the museum\nI Want to I'm a history buff and this things happens to be one of those mythological creatures too\nBut it's the famous statue which you see next to the pyramids ... it ... it ... is a giant lion with a human head on it yeah it's one of them was magnificent things you've probably never see unless you go to Egypt it doesn't look like I'm ever going to get to go but uh\nI I Would like to see it in real life or the thinks it has a really interesting\nRiddle for the human being correct a it's a it's something that goes along the lines of what animal walks on four paws in the morning to pause in the middle of the day and then in the day on three paws for and the answer the riddle is a human being the toddler turns into demand turns into the old man\nThat you leave the came you know they seem to me was asking the question the sinks has just one of those really cool hearts of history of\nOne of those great legends and uh I don't know if people would have known that we were referencing that does face it we were and you just vengeance\nBeing solution I don't remember the origin of that particular piece yeah but it did involve like a statue of the ... as a part of it so it was it was and then there was this to some body meant of a person so only there had remained\nI Want to go back to what something you you mentioned as a joke\nYou know you can leave your kids inside the scream millions and scream machine yeah but you know just just to clarify and you can't actually wanted to know actually I was going to the end of the size of knowing that if you're going to leave your kids anywhere you're going to lose your kids the children's museum that is one of the safest places to do it\nWe and we also find our every kid that's I mean whenever we have a child who's laws were very practical in fact we find most of them and under five minutes or so and it goes really it's not so much the kids get lost\nAs it is if they decide that they find some very interesting and the parents have not no because they're looking at something interesting the kids are never lost they knew exactly where they are yeah it's the parents who got lost\nSo [laughter] I've\nEvery time I've been that has happened to me you stop in front of something you become interested in you forget that you're there with some of the ...\nAnd ... and ... again I'm unemployed museum but all things told I've had to do a search for last gets for both my kids\n[laughter]\n\nAnd is that an example yes it's very embarrassing as a staff members and I lost my child [laughter] hands you know everybody feel comfortable because I like you know raise their hand\nGoes I don't know where they are either yep yep and happens from time to time it's just it's just the nature of what we offer there is that everything is so tantalizing so interesting that kids very easily get distracted with what they're doing and want to go take a look at something and\nYou know I see a lot of times gets faster than the parents and they can zip through things and it's like they're gone and\nIt's like wait where where'd my child go stay right here a second ago [laughter]\nWell it's a big place I don't mind describing the people who have never been absolutely but it's in the heart of the museum district and it's really easy access like I said you're open for free on Thursday afternoons you can shake\nA damn that's right yeah just come on in five to eight PM are open for free also um if you are\nIn many neighborhoods centers will offer free passes for families that need a little extra assistance because we want to welcome everyone our mission is to transform communities there in innovative shelter and learned throughout the entire Houston community to benefit from what we offer\nSo if you can't afford come anyways we will get you in because it's that important to us to have every single person to come in and we want to offer the safest happiest\nHalloween to you possibly can so that's the whole point of our thirty first as we're trick or treating all day long some pick up your kids from school bring 'em straight over will be open ... eight pm that night\nSo there are eight trick or treat stations you can stop by we're trying to get rid of all the money that are given out candy or is are these are our people are everyone's dressed up we don't have anyone who is just you know hanging out normal close we have everyone dressed up everyone's he ended up to I mean we've got tons of candy we've got to get rid of so please come out\nTo get it can be judged by a truckload of candy ... yes we do\nWe're ... we're ... candy yes we buy outs of I mean we're we're we expect that we're going to give out all of our candy every year and so we we make sure but we know what our population is and and we see a lot of people were very excited to see everyone come out and join us we also have another very special piece\nThis Halloween is called the monstrous spell\nAnd what it is it is what's called a puzzle hunt so it's a combination of puzzles to solve and a scavenger hunt see go all around the museum you need to solve a puzzle at every single spot to get the hint for you go next\nThis is uses augmented reality and your phone and it only costs five dollars were on everyone does come try docs is our first experiment with this kind of thing and it's a it's a free app to download it's called clue keeper so if you download your element is we did not develop that we came back we know people who know Pete yeah\nWho introduced me to the actual developers of clue keeper and it's a wonderful wonderful thing\nAnd the whole puzzle hunt community was like really excited to hear about this so we it's been a tremendous asset and we had a lot of fun developing this so this is our first foray into it as we explore augmented reality is explore publications and that we're looking towards the future where give me some future ones that were going\nHelp right away and well the first things he outside executives as they said let's take a look at all the agreements to to try and\nThey were appalled at ... degree in the sick or we're getting hosed here big time I Want here's the deal [noise]\nI go rewrite the ones

Briggs mom had it and yet found the same faith\nThat he had um\nThere's things that are in the Bible if we don't understand them can be very offensive to people\nOne in particular was a woman should paraphrasing\nTake second fiddle to the man and like that's not what Jesus meant but if you take a look at my mom in how the state of Michigan chip passed up on jobs because of her marriage to go right\nShe was sick of taking second fiddle and then when she wasn't an angry feminist by any means but\nShe was just sick of me and maybe abuse that way than reading that in the Bible like that's great\nWell I think when she wrap their arms around what that really meant she's like oh\nAnd we have Bible study here at our corporate office she started going to the Bible study and started having

hundred\nTo zero eight three to zero nine ... just tuned in we have Dr Michael ... back in the studio with us today he's a leading authority on both natural and alternative health we've been talking about how critical vitamin C is in terms of overall health\nNow Dr paying as I got to ask the question I mean you know you you you've got to talk to a little bit about some of the things that we can be experiencing without having enough item and see but you know the reality is\nThat I'm sure I'm not getting enough item in sea based on what you said I I I I'm not arguing that point but the reality is that I'm Still standing I I still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy\nWhen you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a de minus because they're already a for vitamin C is sixty milligrams sixty military ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the vitamin C. we need and you need vitamin C. the right amounts and the right form in order to get yourself into a high level\nHealth but why why is that so critical do why is getting enough fight 'em and see so critical\nWhile just recap number one your body doesn't make it\nToo is that if you're not getting the right amount of it which is at least three thousand four thousand five thousand milligrams per day vitamin C. you're going to be someone who is on multiple medications you run into doctors you're got blood pressure problems\nYou don't make the good cholesterol triglycerides are high you might be diagnosed with diabetes you have pain in your body you're looking at old and you're feeling old before you shouldn't be oh\nAll right well let's let's get into this a little bit then I mean can you talk about what's in your supersede twenty two formula\nYeah what what I have is first of all it's a powder that you mix into cold water okay and each serving is Fifteen hundred milligrams of vitamin C.\nOkay and it has twenty two different sources of vitamin C. which is very very important for your body what's the benefit of having those twenty two different sources well the benefit is is is that your body recognizes these from nature\nAnd there's there's a number of different sources from nature there's rose hips broccoli\nCertain type of cherry called an asteroid cherry lemons lines grapefruit with the supersede twenty two I've tried to duplicate what's in nature and I put it in one form I see okay well speaking which can we can we make some yeah I Want to try it right here yeah okay All right now why it why a powder instead of let's say\nA pill or a capsule or something like that well vitamin C. it's it's necessary to get it in your system not just in your blood but down to the tissues\nSo any powder and you put water in it it activates it absorbs quickly this is the best way to get in your body it's fuzzy is this supposed to ... yeah the ... is showing that is activated the minerals and all the vitamins they're actually mixing in the water okay just keep it up for a second\nAll right All right let me let me try this\nNew that's really good it is good isn't it yeah yeah so like a ... taste\nAs actual extremism fruits that I put in there to flavor it really good at a good job Dr ... thank you thank you yeah people really enjoy the taste of it what I recommend Chris as you can actually mix up a bunch of it put in a service or a pitcher you can keep in their ... or you can drink it throughout the day\nNow ... you know again I think most people myself included have always thought about vitamin C. um you know with respect to cold and flu and building up your immunity but you know you're talking about things that go way way\nBeyond that so what about cardiovascular how how does vitamin C. help with that well vitamin C is needed to keep the inside of the blood vessels strong when and if you like\nBut most of the problems people are having collapsed arteries strokes ... ladder can in their body yeah vitamin C. makes what's called college in tissue in the body without it you don't make this repair tissue so you get this deterioration occurring when you don't have enough okay so it's very very important for cardiovascular health\nNow when you take your super see twenty two ... is it something you can feel working I mean what ... what kind of do\nOh yeah you feel a work in the first sign of health is more energy and you start feeling the energy okay and along with

show I'm Chris McKay have a great day everybody [noise]\nDarkest day of Pittsburgh history I'm Pam who's now Fox News that's how the city's mayor describes the massacre that took place yesterday inside a synagogue\nHatred will not have a place anywhere\nBiases or that people had\nMore importantly I think that that and I was told by numerous people that were at the lunch in that it was one of the best lunch and he talked about that that um [noise]\nThe divide today in our country specifically that you have to mediums you have a liberal medium and a conservative medium or you know there's the CNN's or the world and then the box of the world and that he feels that it's really a is escalating how people\nAre aren't comfortable up or I Would say not comfortable um that that we are dividing our country because now you can you you don't have a\nChoice of one network where you feel I'm\nGetting to the true story although he he didn't say that\nOne or the other but there's there's a slant yeah and um he felt that that that is really bad for our country and daddy called it the tipping point that that he doesn't the U.S going back to the Walter Cronkite the ... of the world that we reach this this time period we're now we're going to have to\nUh our political views are going to be based on what what television or network we watch\nWow you know that probably might have existed even back in the seventies when he was there but to a lesser extent or but it certainly seems to me that the folks in in the television industry and the communication industry have responded to a well specifically Houston's diversity I mean look at what to\nLook at who we have on the air now a very good representation I think of a of folks and hopefully a truthful a representation without bias that's a tough thing to do though isn't it yeah\nUh you know I yeah obviously the um the local news that they're not going to have as much biased because again it's local news now and that's what he talked about up there was one interesting point they may do ah they were talking about the what are the common languages and um\nThe schools today\nYou know you would have thought okay English Spanish and um Mandarin and it was an English Spanish in Mandarin it was English Spanish and Arabic\nWhich tells you a lot about the diversity of of this um up this city you know there are sixty at least sixty countries represented in the city today so it is a extremely diversity and yes you're right you can see it in our anchors um when he look when you look at the local news\nYeah dancing to doing a good job we've got a great city here and and then as soon as I said uh it is one of the most diverse cities in the country I Believe we're ten years ahead of LA in that regard so this is a fun time to be in a in media and marketing and advertising isn't it\n[noise] it is it is it's a it's definitely a changes on a daily basis you know you you obviously you have the you\nKnow they also talked about the the change with a TV viewing where he built was talking about one of his sons in college that he shows up at the dormitory actually it was one of the um Spanish anchors was talking about shows up at the doubt dormitory and he says where's your TV where's your stereo and he pointed to his smartphone\n[laughter] yep that's the way it's going folks and uh I think I think broadcasters figure that out and doing a good job of responding move out as well yeah\nThe TV is no longer a I'm\nA television is the way we saw it is now an extension of our computer now where we watch Netflix and Amazon and and Hulu and whatever so it's all stream and not at all screaming but so much of it is is stream now\nAll box the convenience factor in the mobility factor and that's the way it is and it's a good thing I guess right\nSo let's let's wrap up with a just a commentary here is uh things are good things are looking really good for twenty nine team for abs of Houston and lots of things on the horizon so glad to have you have to fill a helping steer things and making things right for ... Houston\nWell it's like they always say ah in the sports analogy is all about the team [noise]\nThat's the only Nineteen American advertising awards gala in silver medal awards reason patient also known as\nThe ... is coming up on Saturday February sixteen twenty nine teams\nHyatt Regency downtown this is the uh the the the regular place to the guys hang out with all of the awards and such and it's always a cool event and you might wonder why\nWe're talking about this so early I mean it's a long way from sixteen of a twenty Nineteen but the the point is is that we need to talk about it now because there are a lot of things that are are in preparation for this event and those include your submissions\nWorld War and all the good things that go along with that and we're able to hook up with a very busy guy I mean this guy and all over done that we have to happen to catch him sitting down a Alvin right is a president of the album ride communications and I know you know well you probably met them if you haven't you need to do that\nAre out and write communications uses are really really cool from does a lot of great things in albums also sitting on the board at the American administration used them and you're also sitting on the the board for the American advertising awards gala on the sixteenth so do\nHow do you find time to get things done and you're busy world album and welcome by the way\nOh well thank you so much for the kind words as well this has been a challenge above all tongue is\nBecause uh I I've only been a part of a for low um did\nTwo years and that became editor because they got to a meeting late so\nI guess it's not just teach Alva [laughter] [laughter]\nI was told us the best fulltime nonpaying job you'll ever have and it has proven to be just that ah but for me this whole process is very\nInteresting because it is it gives me more of an insight to how this process of\nPutting together an at a gala\nIs and uh having only two years experience of actually attending a at ease in the past one as a as a guess of a friend of mine was the recipient and\nAnd going last year as a board member are still and all with uh all the different particulars that make this thing work the the main thing I thought was interesting was the collaborations of people\nWho are there to see who wins the awards um who are which will push creative pieces are better than other ones and then the networking a part of it but for the planning part for me\nThis has been a labor of love and I I'm a tell you I I Can't be more thankful for all the folks up have land their support their knowledge to experience and helped me to get this thing together it's been a whirlwind for me because I come to this day not knowing\nAnything and now or to the point where uh we're getting down to ... know ready to get a folks are on their on their toes and providing\nThis great outstanding creative advertising work that has been created in this in this uh uh\nOrganization and so I Can't wait for the stars\nSo you go from being your guest [noise] excuse me I Will be used to being the ... here for the worst prison and coming up you know that's a pretty dramatic ascension what is the most challenging thing that you run into this one time\nWell I think the most challenging ... is the organizational part of the layers before you get to the calls and treat\nThe things that have to be done before and and I like I said before I I've been really blessed to have a a lot of really smart people in front of me got into this process in regards to the\nCreative and looking at that and and then how to push that out and then\nUh the the layers of the portals and the rules and regulations the guidelines of things that make this whole process worthy and worthwhile because\nWhen you submit something and for\nThese awards are it's very vital that\nLeg work in the process that we do beforehand has done well because this was people's careers sister lives their livelihood and so if if I don't have this foundation straight\nThen it it it just gets to to be a a fiasco and that's not what we want to have because I think that that most folks like this is a testament to a year of hard work you've dedication devotion to making sure that they produce\nGood ads and if they keep their clients happy and that uh there's a structure in place that\nUh provides this layer of of ah accomplishments\nLayer of achievement that layer of a you know you've done a good job credibility is important so those things are very important making sure that uh one of this year we listen to a of the ... the ah a suspicion last year's ... we've changed things up as well to\nBelong to talk about some of those changes on them and ... the promotion\nYeah what what we heard last year was the first of all was the way the art was displayed a we had some people who thought the lighting was bad so we've trained who made some drastic change topic on display this from I Can't\nGive another way I Want people to come and see what we've done and they will be lose and then we'll be off because they ... they were loving what they let me see\nAnd how we display of the work um we're also going to expand the areas of displaced so for example on the second floor if you if you remember when you walk in and you can go into the ballroom and they're everything is well we're going to expand that\nWell we've got lots of a registration coming in from all over the ... ... ... can and we've got you know Texas I Am sitting on a registration west Texas I Am an um LA she Louisiana style\nUm we are they coordinating all the registration that are coming in and then getting all the committees and a ramp gap and and ready to pick a thing on it take over a hundred and ten volunteers\nFrom the advertising community yet come together to help that death on and we rely upon a lot of on our ah young professional group which is the attitude that I mean like Garrett talked about that\nYeah yeah thanks for having us on the show today\nI had a quick recap of kind of what they event or what in conference is uh every year they ask you an athlete and put on this conference that where in from all across the F ... district is Texas Oklahoma Arkansas and Louisiana partly that\nUm all get together and they have a ... eight hours or to work on a whole campaign develop the fall campaign for a client that the price line they find out at the\nConference and that client get them present their problem that communication problem that they need help solving and then all these things from all over the top ... strict area\nThan um are taken back different age and the the host them and they have six to eight hours to put together a a campaign and then present that\nA campaign of marketing and advertising campaign that will address that communication problem with that that mystery client is having eight hours and I've been in that I met in that\nAnd I were a lot of great stuff comes in to play and then moved to expose and and and shared with the folks at the conference right\nIt it it's really fascinating to see the work that the that student um generate at a conference that made it really kind of blows you away and every year the judge it they're just amazed by the quality of the work and I thought that goes into at I'm In that short amount of time to come up with these campaign ideas\nAnd this year we're excited we've got a national brand at the client\nUm the client is a former protests a pen and they said that um that which I think just brings a whole nother level to the competition that you\nKnow it it is somebody that has sat in his shoes at the student status now um you know heading up the advertising for the national brands that we're very excited about having them on board\nSo the students go obviously incredibly excited about being able to participate in the uh fortunately participate it'd be a part of the civilians I should say but I got to see I bet you guys are just as excited to put together and see what happens when\nOh yeah they're very much so it's a really exciting for me to being on the on the other side of it I did it a bit\nOver three years when I was in college myself on the University of Houston alum go ... and um it was just a great learning experience for me great cases to put in like a portfolio resume a great experience exposure to professionals and people that are you know potentially hiring or maybe hiring future\nUh it's also great a real world experience when I get asked a lot from\nStudents are is how does the real working world differ from being in college and classes and that the biggest difference I've noticed is that when you when you're in college everything's more theoretical and ... you know it's\nIt's more in a bubble and this is definitely one of those things where you get to actually work with a group of people and\nBuild a real campaign for real client real work they're going to uh when it's over they own all that so they're going to take all of a campaign of parts of the campaigns and and probably use that for a for their marketing materials the ear you will more than likely or the\nMaterials are being used across the country though just a really great experience all around them for for students\nThis is one serious opportunity for a student of marketing and advertising ... as we uh as I said there in the eleventh hour how do we get folks involved who want to be involved in this one time\nGuys\nWould direct them to go um if they want to register activity
