{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Because after all what is one group of blue collar people that overwhelmingly vote for Republicans\nWell it's usually the farmers and ... and apparently you know it's now become the rust belt workers to but but getting back to the farmers and this also affects the rust belt workers I mean both Bob pretty much any blue collar workers affected by this trade deal 'cause that\nThat's what this that's what this pertains to is is is your bread and butter whatever it is you're doing soy dairy what are you doing\nCorn no iron and steel those things all affect blue collar workers right and that's what the terrorists are all about terrorists are staffed I hate trade wars I'm so glad this is coming to an end oh it's just such a way it off of our soldiers and by the way\nIf you're wondering how the economy is doing Simpson stock market way up since this news broke\nYou check your you check your portfolio this morning or in the past twenty four hours I mean this didn't just happened yesterday and happened Sunday night\nA great news for the good old USA really awesome finally just nonsense is coming to an end and it won't hurt the Republicans in November which is the main thing we were worried about\nSo now the Trump Administration is going to send the new deal to Congress is going to be a sixty day review period I think it's pretty likely this is going to pass I Can't imagine that either side as critical as the Democrats were of the tariffs and the trade war\nWhich usually is something that they love they love tariffs they ... as a as critical as they were of it they couldn't possibly vote against ending it\nAnd of course the Republicans are going to vote for it because it's their party saying you know this is the ... this is a Trump Republican policy come to fruition\nAnd Trump and his people they've been working to sign a new trade deal before Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on December first so to meet the deadline the text of the agreement had to be submitted to Congress before October and now it's October\nSo that's where the sixty days incomes and he did it the sixty day thing at a lot to do with Mexico\nAnd we needed to get you know this guy leaves office on December first in Mexico and we need him to sign the deal it's possible that the new president would sign it too although the guy that replacing NATO in Mexico is even farther to the left him he's a hardcore social is I mean if Mexico wasn't far to the left before oh point where do you see this new guy\nThings are not ah things are not looking good for Mexico but they are looking good for the good old USA Today so it's pretty good news right All right I told you I was gonna I was going to defend drowned and then I was going to beat them up so let's do it right now Donald Trump said something very very very silly\nAnd he said that about one of the worst people in the world I'm so why don't we just play the tape\nI was really being tough and so I went back and forth [noise]\n\nTrump told a cheering crowd at a campaign rally [noise]\nThat while there was once the tough back and forth between him and North Korean leader Kim Jong il an a ha ha well\nKim they fell in love you fell in love\nA it's a figure of speech I guess but then you got to be careful about using language now you're the president you're talking about a guy who puts his are citizens and ... they've concentration camps in North Korea and North Korea there is a modern day version of the Holocaust taking place\nSo about Trump is in West Virginia on Saturday Night telling people that Kim Jong il and wrote in beautiful letters and they found them up Kim Jong un is in North Korea having his political enemies murdered fed to the dogs\nBut I mean I don't know that that literally happened this weekend but that's the sort of thing he does and didn't do that in one of his uncles and he had his half brother assassinated in Malaysia and this this is just an ... a day in the life of Kim Jong il and he's not a good guy sure you might be better than his dad or his\nGrandpa well ... is really into hip hop and basketball and McDonalds he likes Dennis Rodman and the Chicago Bulls but he also likes having his political enemies murdered because that's how he was raised\nYou know that's what his father told him was normal that's what you do know oh this is what we do in our family we all enemies good for you wrote him\nSuch Trump Trump says he's ... they love each other Trump noted that came as interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump is a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea how's that going stalled currently that doesn't now don't\nDon't assume that that means anything this is a slow moving process remember this is the end of a war\nAnd some people think the the Korean War ended in the fifties no this is the end of the Korean War the Korean War is never ended there's never been peace between these two nations they live right next door to each other with one with one nation with their nuclear weapons in their finger on the button the all time\nWell it's pretty hard for North Korea to new south Korea because it would destroy their entire country but that doesn't mean they can't try to kill America\nAnd America probably wouldn't want to destroy North Korea because we'd heard our friends in the process this has always been the basis of the the conflict I Know you people understand I just want to make sure we're on the same page here so we do here in pursuit of happiness radio I don't I Can't assume you guys know everything I don't want a ball over you with facts\nSometimes we sometimes we got to give you the basics and then we got to do one on one\nSo we can get to far away it's a college course reference I didn't even have a course for weight North Korean extremism one on one that's with with Ken Webster junior that's me anyway I should just meanwhile you got to give it a Trump per se and silly stuff like that you know what I\nMainly being tough and so it was always a back and forth [noise]\nWhat are you doing come on [noise]\nYou're talking about a communist two murders people\nAnd you love each other I don't know I'm making a mountain out of a molehill maybe\nAbout ... this is the stuff you like your praised Trump and you apply the guy 'cause I I never thought he would do so many things that would make me happy as a citizen of the U. S. and he has he's really done a great job of deregulating and lowering taxes and\nThe trade or I just got done explaining the trade war that's going well now if we can just wrap it up with China and then after all of that he goes yeah you're doing a good job Trump what\nWhat else Trump oh yeah I Love I Love the leader of communist North Korea what\nDo you got to knock it off\nAnyway I'm Ken Webster junior I really appreciate all you all for listening I got a\nSpecial event coming up here at the radio station and I am very limited seating but I Want one of you to go in fact\nI'm going to have room for five of you in in each of you can bring one guest to an exclusive closed door town hall meeting here at Cape your seat\nWe're going to broadcast it live on the radio it's going to be me Jesse Kelly Jimmy beret my buddy Charles Adams and we're very excited about this the details are coming soon on that if you want to go contacted me on line very limited seeding\n[laughter] success so hell bent on my mood or I Want to fly a diesel truck was ...

Easter or whatever the hell her name is a no other woman that they reached out to a\nUnlike these women who nobody knows them they can't like go back and they try to find these names that they give people I never heard ever I don't remember her uh I didn't yeah sorry newer but I never went to any party I don't know what she's talking about all these parties this guy\nAll his witnesses all know him do yeah there's no way that's the guy I mean this guy never gang rape anybody I mean there's that whole thing where he said he was a virgin till college it's probably true said he was not a player at high school\nThere's also a large gang of women who have come out to speak out for\nA judge Kavanaugh and not one of them has been interviewed by NBC they don't put them all and make a special report about doesn't that doesn't fit the story of the of the entire group highlight the hundred or two hundred however many women it is now\nThat have signed letters were ... they were in the hallway appeared showed up the day he testified and what are they covered him the screaming idiot women that were in the hallway is writing times ... an\nA weird things off the top her head like are we believe the survivor we believe the survivor and you know she's a survivor\nWhy or why do you believe or you don't know where you never met her either you or believe in before we ever saw on TV then you saw on TV and the rest of us quickly ascertain a\nAnd emotionally troubled woman Oh yes who has either mental problems or emotional problems are probably both\nAnd then there's a long history of other people talking about her problems and then the other one which had restraining order shaking out because he stalks people\n...\nHas been had like some kind of a Russian accent and and you think about her name last name that third one and there is a Russian kind of a name she might be a Russian check but um she doesn't have an accent yeah she's doing man\nYeah she ... the husband definitely had a Russian accent though\nHe says yeah I said we attack took out a restraining order a\nShe was threatening to kill at the time uh she was carrying a baby she was going to kill the un born baby a she made all kinds of threats you got to burn his house down there all kinds of things and\nHe said yeah the woman is not stable set and one of her favorite\nThings constantly talking about law suits suing people see her big dream was to sue somebody for big bucks that's what this is all about the guy said oh so this\nWhole thing about keeping this guy on the Supreme Court she could care less she's thinking I got this lawyer we make enough steak we're going to find a way to get a case and get some money out of this dude you know somebody's going to pay us money to go away we'll they thought on tape broader up\nThat may be a Republican or some well heeled donor types would pay her off to go away that didn't happen so that's when they had to go public and back up the story because really what they just wanted was a big\nCash and then walk away with the cash thing and of course a slice would go to the creepy porn lawyer and somebody will go to hurt you have money for nothing and your checks for free which is what she was looking\nFor the other side of the world they don't know who Kevin Oh isn't good care list there now I don't know million hundreds of thousands at least that are still suffering after the Indonesian earthquake\nAnd what is Trump done to help not a thing not a thing he just sitting there and letting the brown people starve because that's what he does the\nDeath toll keeps going up because you know I mean they've been dead it's not like they're dying since yesterday but the devil poll went up from eight hundred at this time yesterday to over twelve hundred now Trump has done nothing to help the said his wife and her bind fashions are good hair\nTo sweat Guyana or somewhere she will even go to Indonesia where they really need a\nAnd she wears the wrong shoes when she goes to help out ... that she was like these uh no little blah Knicks or whatever to go work in the swap\nStuff that was Michelle Obama there was wearing those they would have to know the ... on a special interview asking him how Michelle worked with him to create the shoes that she's wearing it\nSpecial flood related choose what she's or one of a stunning mind of a woman has to help design these things really is a fashion plate and credible yeah yeah so if you had a nominee over at your house you probably don't care much about the Supreme Court right now\nIf I had a Saddam me at my house but one thing I Know if Trump would not helped me no he would go out of his way to not helped me he would probably call and taught me on the line even make fun of you that I'm not helping [laughter] sorry\nSort of a ... that's what we're dealing with here that and he probably gang raped me to him and his plan for the Supreme Court just going around gang rape\nAnd everybody is like\nAnd they usually get upset because people would believe that Brock Obama was born somewhere else and they they they dumped him birthers ocean I Know how dare you a forensic team is proven his birth certificate has a stake you all knew it was it's a real they proved it that's a real indicator for people that really look\nAt evidence but a boy or girl where you're just that's on America and

they were getting screened time she was against us you had to come out yesterday and\nSaid that she's running for president even though she swore I Will never run for president and now she's coming out as she was course planning to do it all along that now these other ones that are Spartacus and the Seventy kicker and this other guy are all getting to jump on me and all kinds of screen\nTime there's a though what's her name to wanna tell them to want to Rollie yeah she said\nDon't think that's for sure you know it for the Raleigh making trouble says she was a very young probably good run

was this local battle we've been a witness in between black man in white man\nWho see two guys running for Congress do their job it's ugly it is ugly if you track the commercials one minute you're kind of lean and into this one guy and then another commercial comes on and you went back there well I'll give you some examples here\nTell us why local positive politician for the people\nVoted for ...\nLower taxes and affordable college tuition for your children now she wants to lower prescription drug prices and as an advocate for decreasing healthcare con wow that's a quarter of our veterans

give you another example of some more examples because we're bombarded with these everyday\nLeon Black men is a candidate for the people\nLeon has fought hard for equality for all\nThese fought

that show I totally agree with him but it just doesn't mean extra\nChecks out it does when you when you hear him ... and we will tell you\nI'm gonna get really believes that now I Believe that that just really believe something horrible happened to her and she really believes this guy did it but\nNobody else believes is the reason she was so wimpy and childlike and nervous as sounding is because she really believes that the Democrats will do something horrible to her if she doesn't tell the story I think if you look at Hillary body that's\nExactly a pretty good fear I think making a great stories man I they say this Blumenthal character\nCan leave a a tale of misfortune in the war like nobody else should you owe them up a little bit if you hear him tell it I mean he was he was running through the jungle he was out\nThere with sergeant in theory right now is that it's actually very me a demo undercover agent orange that show\nThat was a there fighting the the calm now he finally did go into the marine reserves in Nineteen Seventy four twenty five years old\nBut he was never pinned down on the ... the caliber machine or set foot in the country oh say he was not in country\nHe repeatedly and consistently claim to have served in Vietnam which is a huge case of stolen valor and he's got a he has received a letter from Fort teen medal of honor recipients\nAre telling him that you need to knock that off\nHe received five military deferments between the ages of about a twenty to twenty four Nineteen twenty four somewhere in that range\nSeemingly political favors so he could avoid joining up in the war so we want to go to Vietnam yeah and then they've done the research and they found a few of the the shameful things that he is said to inflate his military service\nRecord he says\nWhen returning from Vietnam we saw nothing like this a public outpouring of support for deployed military personnel in two thousand eight the report New York times that we've learned something important since the days I served in Vietnam ha ha and he says well\nI didn't lie well yeah you did I may have ... represented that's a lot I may have ... spoken you lied but he lie a little bit first he tried not to even have to go into the military and that didn't work out\nSo a daddy or somebody got him a sweet spot where he would never have to actually do anything happens a lot of Democrats who remember John Kerry exploit the ... uh\nThan people that might be the swift boat Ghassan\nWe're with John Kerry a nominee didn't do any of that stuff and they said that's what cost him the presidency he's lying script both guys slip I've got to have and we weren't ally and\nThe guy didn't do anything he was there but\nHe just one of many Goldberg her hanging around or tried to skirt through a service that during a damn thing he said and then there was Hillary Clinton when she got off the aircraft in Bosnia and that was under sniper fire machine gun fire and they had the ducked down and fight\nThem and then when they found the footage of her getting off the airplane\nStrolled over to the people agreed with handshakes and they all chatted brief ... or send pictures and then they tell you when we walked over to their cars that were no waiting nearby gunfire the sniper fire there was no being pin down\nIt's just a lot do you remember the story that Brian Williams told that ended up getting him removed from the b._b._c. news he human bodies floating by gets really wasn't it well ... there was the Katrina why are they also told a story about riding\nIn the uh the ... with the military in the ... or\nA hundred feet off the ground and they took fire\nThen they had to how hard crash landing and the whole time that\nThey're all by themselves ... son was playing over the sounds like we were coming in on the beach life and death moments and I don't really know what happened in Katrina he was talking about dead bodies floating by and then later admitted there weren't any ...\nBut remember the reason he did it was because he knows his audience likes a good story or he didn't do it to inflate his own self worth and his ego or make himself look the more important to the it was to entertain us and I appreciate it\n[laughter] my bosses said uh don't just report the news be the new\nMayor you get dirty get money and that's where he went wrong road transcript of

they're less social than dogs or they don't really give a damn what you think of them they take it a little less when the heart\nSo really if your cat had a phone it would totally use it as a way to ignore you also it would pay you back when in fact many cell\nPhone you're talking about on your phone he cheated on his own agenda joke cat shown out you'll say well I'm On the phone to have a veal

ads now the American civil liberties union used to actually stand for something and they used to actually defend liberties\nI don't know what the hell they're descending when they spend more than a million dollars to compare judge Kavanaugh to Bill Cosby now you know what this means they protecting anybody they're hardcore Democrats course that's what they're doing what we've always known\nThat this is nothing to protect this guy does it need we don't need to be protected from this guy this nonsense\nIt's turned from allegedly being a job interview about something that you're actually

they're saying about Trump it is but it's about you\nYou you voted wrong you think wrong you you don't think like we do and now we got a new paradigm in America ruled by right ruled by a\nWhen it called resistance used to we one of the things we're most proud of is we have an election happy election was over if you lost even though you didn't like the guy that got elected was like well\nYou're fight hard to do the battle but when it's over fair he's the guy friends issued enough power is something we were kind of famous for yeah he's the president whether I like it or not enough and happy\nFor four years until I can vote for somebody else he's the guy I look at it this way this time\nAnd it's only the second time in history they didn't look at it this way and as you know the first time that this happened in history didn't go well no the first time that they didn't accept the election\nAnd decided they would quote resist the election was a fellow by the neighbor Abraham Lincoln\nI've heard of him really whole half of the country and I think we know which half [laughter] we're not accept this guy we're going to resist\nWe're going to fight him next thing you know it

into\nIt a little bit otherwise you say you're willing to accept the kind of behavior that we're seeing coming from these Democrats day that you're fine with it I think we have to stretch to paint fine with it you have to vote and then you have to drive\nTo another place and then vote as Mickey Mouse then you've got to drive to another and vote as Juan Valdez if there wasn't so horribly illegal

work harder\nAnd be more productive on the base we work I don't trust the communist to tell me anything we'd rather work more but they hold us back they restrict is kind of just how much work they'll let us do around here I mean I really love work and I just I mean the harder the better what did you go\nTo the possibility of experimenting with this give me an example open minded is all I'm saying what if we were to take a day you know soon ... about two days and then and then come back when we took to the you know like Monday\nAnd see how much more productive we can be next week I think that's a good idea even thinking about it now is making me want to be more productive at this moment yeah I think it's a good idea we should or possibly at least try it not that we want to but if it's good for our fellow man\nThen we will sacrifice for the good of all I'm like you I look around every day and I say what this is my fellow man need yeah you do [laughter]\nAt all times I'll leave this office building where we work and I'll I'll stop and pause\nAnd think of what the hell's wrong with this guy was established I'm pausing and looking around I'm looking around and see what my fellow man needs a survey and then of course I get that car slam the door put my glasses on and get home as quickly as possible but first of all of course I check and usually uh it's just been\nKind of the current state of things that my fellow man doesn't mean anything that looks like they're good you know what I'm home going to get a sandwich take a nap battle ... looks like it's taking care of well good to know that I check you live All right yeah that's right that's the most important to always check oh was that fellow man need\nWhat can I Do ... ... ... sometimes it's nothing like yet check and that's the key [laughter] [noise] it's kinda like I'm\nWhat Amanda's fighting side led side upside down sideways how many people are going to demonstrate join the conversation it doesn't\nMatter what side you're from what matters is what you say the truth is behind it and the consisting fifty\nSuccess CEO talk\nSit on a no we'll have a few that are looked down over your heard we have a few\nCows um my wife has a few cows your head we prefer black kettle black girls will 'cause you'd like to keep a locked up and up they're like\nThey're going to go where you want to go anywhere I won't go behind bars in cages are basically is what you got over ... we\nDrive around and talk them they will never have their freedom oh no we're stare at them and do you ever need so\nThat every once in a wild cat will jump out and get free uh-huh nobody got chased him down mhm but the only thing left or a hot brand and just you know think certain as they will be eaten at some point in time by unless just after all if not us someone lead them ...\n... ... so we got about a I don't know eight of them something like that but that's how\nYou got to have more than eight have cattle what'd you have there's cows and you gotta like six hundred of them you got cattle\nYeah you've got something that we just have you gals but they do Salter\nWhenever they're not putting in a hurry except chasing them or Haslam 'cause a cow all ... very much has that Earl Campbell kind of attitude river Earl Campbell used to run real fast and then get tackled and he would ... back to the\nHuddle ... slow getting back yeah\nNo big Russian everybody will say why you know why I'm not a little hustle little jump up a run so fast you sure do move slow and he was like\nHey you say that\nFor when they're after me with the ball I save a little energy this way just why should I run around for nothing\nNobody's chasing me right now I'll run fast when they're Jason\nBut right now I'm does emblem back to the huddle while I get to play a lot of times I don't need to know what the play is because bump Philips only had three plays in the in the play book Earl to the left are all to the right and Earl up the middle that was just replace\nIt made me decide which way to do when they showed the bold in the belly anyway\nNow every once in a while we had one path play is when we didn't get the first down on the first two roads that we had to go to the past play and that was just called ... dropped back\nFind somebody open drugs to throw up a prior there throw it\nInteresting what goes on out there in the in the end though I was just reading some of the ... the different things we're taking a look at here snoop dog for example has called a Kanye West an Uncle Tom for supporting America as a yes or the America First agenda for supporting\nActual precedent they got elected by the electorate and the United states of America\nSaying Trump Trump Trump just saying America America make America great again the undue is quote down there about as America First and and all of a magnet for American stance comment sections new wrote make music\nGreat again [laughter] and they have music a getting attention make yeah music great again or not\nTo the word we would say you know if you remember I'm Robert Deniro shouted F Trump\nAt an award ceremony and received applause familiar yeah higher building\n... says something outrageous like I support the president and he needs to be committed for psychiatric evaluation\nHow far a CNN analyst that said that we are worried about Kenya we think he may have mental problems yeah\nWe've got new there and in a bottle I look at the money that Conyers bringing in and the money snoop smoking it in these days and he's resigning hosting game shows and stuff I think you should just shot a sit down nobody cares what you\nYou know why we're way past when anybody cares what you think going to say exactly you're really no longer relevant\nI hate to admit that ... is more relevant than you but it is true\nAnd you know irrelevant ah by the way it has been pointed out that the New Orleans has been testing this theory about the work week\nFor a long time now technically all a great deal of Louisiana New Orleans especially already has a three day work week because mainly nothing gets done on friday\nRarely because you're getting ready for the weekend and then you have your weekend and then nothing gets done on Monday much 'cause you're a recovering from the weekend so yeah so you got Tuesday Wednesday Thursday to get to work\nDone and everybody pretty much happy and still get the job done it tested\nA problem with that is there's no reason we can't test it also this they said don't tell anybody now you know 'cause they just got that going on we're going to do a test of whether you there's this coming Monday\nIs a kind of a non official holiday for the city of New Orleans\nIt's kind of a holiday for everyone else in Columbus Day on Monday oh I thought about that a lot of Columbus so we celebrate the great the Christopher discoverer of America\nNow a this coming Monday is a kind of a holiday in New Orleans because Monday Night football is coming to town saints\nIn the dome Monday Night is always a reason to take off early and either start to party or get out of the way one of the other\nWho is the uh I think it's a Redskins oh I'm thinking you can't really have any good seasons or it won't matter of ah\nSame ... especially the know how to shout on Monday Night when the attention of the world is on them and on top of that young fella name a young fella name Drew Brees if he manages to throw\nFor over two hundred yard which is highly likely it it's hard for him not in any given day or he will\nSet the all time passing the yard and ... record in the NFL that pass as he is Jason down and soon will pass\nIn Miami\nNow he needs to work on a gift to either tired or pass it then you'll get more than to a woman on a New Orleans native and it'll be on Monday Night\nPassed up by New Orleans move in now from Texas there you go it only it only makes sense [laughter]\nI like all the races that are in our backs come from Texas is just something you have to get used to it upsets a lot of people view great\nOnes that didn't but far if they didn't spend your time learning yeah from here yeah\n... ... well put it this way they either are from Texas and they went to college in Texas what am I a slide\nIn one of those university so I just you know actually I was a situation you need to prepare for so a Monday holiday all the way around for some people and good isn't that wonderful Christopher Columbus\nThat in our guy Myers themselves out and said I think in a tally in actually he didn't say it in a Taliban but uh\nBecause he was trying to learn Spanish 'cause he was working for the king and queen of Spain at the time sort of tried to pick up the lingo when he came up and they
