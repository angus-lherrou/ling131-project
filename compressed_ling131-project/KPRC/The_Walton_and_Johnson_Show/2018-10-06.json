I'm I'm\nI'm loving this rebate but I'm Still kind of undecided on him\nThat's exactly right yeah the new Lindsey Graham is very interesting and I don't want to say that Lindsey Graham changed because his friend passed away but that's a possibility well\nMaybe so I noticed that he started to become a little more feisty an independent when his friend stopped coming to work\nYeah you're right about that it was a change of tone for Lindsey Graham and it happened right at the same time and if it's just a coincidence fine but it's hard to believe anything it's just a coincidence in Washington DC right anyway and according to a sworn statement by Capitol police a witness Tuesday sock Cosco at a computer in a senator's office we're used to work a day\nAfter two other unnamed senators information of been put on Wikipedia mhm\nCosco worked for other Democratic senators including Dianne Feinstein Maggie Hassan and Barbara Boxer or say just the tip of like the list of the usual suspect right right of the worst of the worst in the Democratic party\nEarlier reports identified him as an intern his lawyer said he was working as a fellow in her office paid by an outside institution now\nI find that to be a little more believable skeptical I don't think he was an intern and ... ...\nI don't think he was an intern if they if he was actually a sell out like a you know fellow at some Institute and they have to work at sea Sheila Jackson leaves office my question is\nWas that counted as they can\nCampaign contribution his his work great question very interesting yeah\nEverybody outside paid him and he wasn't really getting you know school credit even though he's a fellow\nThat so so so so what is the is the tax breaks on political donations I don't think there is right yeah yeah you know get an\nEmail that you've got the reporting that you have to do to the federal\nYeah she said that if you see them yeah 'cause actually very interesting right anyway according to bell statement this was the guy from um [noise] uh from the police department over there on Capitol Hill a Cosco is alleged to have been confronted by a staffer and then walked out the staffer then call police hours later the witnesses\nReceived an email from and this is an email address live ... excuse me live free or pee on or P. M. W.\nPound ah it it basically is from game or talk when you\nLook like owning someone yeah pound yeah I'm done with that yeah owned yeah I don't think that's\nHow I I actually tell you something I kind of knew that that's what it meant but he got owned he got on China and you know he absolutely\nGot on that's absolutely true so sources familiar with the case still Fox News that Cosco was\nUm in senator ... office where he was not authorized to be and was caught using a log and he was not authorized to use an earlier he was let go from Senator has sons off as a spokesman for senator Hassan says she strongly denounces the actions I think that's probably the right thing to do\nYeah I'm I'm actually very happy that there was another staffer who saw him where he shouldn't have been and reported it\nTo this guy had access to Social Security numbers yeah of family members of lawmakers mhm that's remarkable and health records and threatened to and threatened the docks the kids yeah\nThat he should definitely go to prison there should be an investigation into Sheila Jackson Lee there should probably be an investigation into the other senators attached to this a Barbara Boxer well she's not in office anymore okay right but we should still investigating what happened to\nYou know and it's funny my son has a has an interesting history with with interns remember a it was an intern in her office\nWho yelled out you know an obscenity it begins with an s Trump right in the\nCapitol rotunda yeah I Am personally I it's I I think we still investigate staffers Barbara Boxer if Harry Reid if if he worked for Harry Reid I'd say and\nBut yeah I mean because there's probably still around they never go away\nYeah I mean these people are staffers are still involved in Washington DC\nThey are that they are the swamp\nThis is what Trump supporters are talking about when they talk about um the the deep state right they did you say there's a real thing and that's not\nConspiracy theory nonsense that's not infowars a\nTalking points on social media the deep state is a real thing it's a real problem it's the fourth branch of government these people are given access to things and they abuse their power regardless of who is in office because they have access to information\nAnd uh and and and that the regular civilians like you and I just don't have that's right yeah anyway it's scary it's frightening and I don't I don't the worst part about the Sandra is I don't think that this is the last we've seen of this we keep hearing stories\nAbout people on the left attacking people on the right we keep hearing stories about Maxine\nWaters encourages our constituents to go after conservatives are and and then people are surprised with Steve ... get shots right or or or what happened to Rand Paul or or what was the latest one I mean the stuff happens all the\nWell yeah I mean Rand Paul was was I'm not physically attacked that certainly intimidated\nIn in the airport Rand Paul was physically attacked by his neighbor who appears riot extreme left us right and and by and broke six ribs and by the way earlier this week that thing of Ted Cruz's office of the people pretty much forgotten a earlier\nToday emergency crews were sent out to three greenway plaza this is fifty nine and a buffalo speedway right and well that's right where Ted Cruz's officers at\nTo investigate another suspicious package and this happened again today in Houston they had to clear out an office building employees were evacuated from the Twenty one story building it's right in the same area right if this is a coincidence I don't believe that\nYou know I don't I don't believe that there are some some companies in that area but I\nDon't know yeah people were told they couldn't go back and isn't it weird that it happened right by Ted Cruz's office again Mm how does this keep happening\nI I don't know I mean the other day when it happened to Ted Cruz my office is just at Caribbean fifty nine and and\nAnd for two solid hours it was nothing but sirens right\nIt's times like this that we need liberty and truth and freedom more than ever I mean this is the reason why we do what we do I always tell people you know if if you're concerned about the troops getting out there if you're concerned about your own freedom and your own safety ... joined the liberty movement you don't have to join the Libertarian Party joined the liberty movement\nYeah I mean it's just the whole point is you should be responsible for yourself and not and not have anybody else really telling you what to do\nI protect my house or the shock on you know I mean if we have to call the police fine but I'm not worried about them getting there and and I and I'm sure a lot of these conservative lawmakers are the same way with\nFamilies you know and as a as a single woman yes I take my self protection very seriously\nAs you're showing ... as you should Sandy you live in a really nice part of the city you live in a a very very safe little communities and I still worry about you 'cause you're my friend\nRight yes even though I have a large well trained German Shepherd yes to do around with

shop around so that you know they burned\nAll refer to Germany did America studios\nAll your review your\nHe said why isn't he testifying today\nAnd his ... his lawyer said why should I testify\nAccused me of something I'll testify as far as uh why am I testify 'cause there's nothing to testify to this guy Kavanaugh didn't do any of the stuff they said I was not there for any of the stuff he said I never saw any of the stuff\nThat we're supposed to obscene what the hell when I testified do there's nothing there\nThis is all laid up after the Chinese is mad at an old old was dom\n... they're ... they're not ... he's just he's mad because they're they're messing with the the trying to mess with the election and this time against him trying to twist the electric kind of like the Russians did\nOnly or they're going to show that they could do it better than the Russians when I got nothing to do with tears ... bad bad bad well the ... they don't like\nThe terrorist thing either but that's probably the reason they're messing with the election\nThere oh what's your name Obama he never did no ... no it'd be nice if we could get him back that would be ... we were there did much of anything no no fire to cause people it'd be alarmed yesterday he kind of let it float that or even though the the rule if he can't be president again\nHe's basically out there\nBecause people wanted so bad they want to go back just she or Trump wait a bell momma oh over President Obama's jak they're letting it be known that uh you know there might be a way to get me back yeah all boy that would that be ... I mean\nThe rule says one thing but if everybody agrees the rule change maybe the real change because everybody agree to change it\nIt'll be great if we had Obama back as president people would stop fighting each other on stuff people would stop accusing each other of raw doing there would be peace and harmony throughout the land once again because well I mean it wouldn't be but you never hear about it on T. V. anymore they were all disappear from Tom be putting\nIt in the news one night yeah I made the same thing only ... probably the worst because we have to be out of jobs and\nWe'd be broke again and we'd be losing our houses and losing our investment accounts about everything else but it'd be nothing but good news on television every day the news wouldn't see any of them they just be report and happiness and sunshine and probably human interest stories or how many how much before a loving Brock Obama and his\nHow needy was and how he always seem so scrubbed up and ready for an appearance and\nYou know what a and you're supposed to call him President Obama even though he's no longer president you still attached the tidal even after his uh the rain has he has to do that with ... truck I'll just don't draw for needle Trump\nPresident Obama's net worth somebody looked into even now today he's you know he was making huge money when he was president you know they make four hundred thousand dollars\nA year that's for eight years that's millions of dollars right there\nAnd ah and then of course if you don't spend any of it though if you don't have to really goes we take care of everything for him as a you know as travel it's not ... and ... and all that we give somebody half a million dollars a year why are we paying for everything good question a\nTrump nominee to Obama that President Obama is now worse thirty times what he was worse when he got into office as president\nAnd he doesn't own a business of any kind or any kind of the factory or\nAs a course making speeches and writing books and tell him lives to the world he's worth forty million dollars just pay it that just like that is that is that the global is the Soros type vinyl and some cash doing I guess so it gets that goes a it's a struggle and people will pay for the struggle\nNone amazing he's a crook people who get rich\nServing the public in public office are crooks I noticed driving and you mentioned Taliban a little while ago and today is their big day and do you want to celebrate\nAlong with a ... all of those boys over there and the ones that are here waiting at twenty two years ago the Taliban which we really didn't talk about in Nineteen Ninety six\nThey captured the capital city of Kaboom\nAfter three days of hard fighting and well it was known this coup bull before they are now even after we're going to feel they got their three days of hard to fight and drove the president of Afghanistan out\nFed into exile it was basically the beginning the birth if you will of they're evil iron fisted re went to his big woolly hat\nDanced around in the street when it when we ran him out about that and that twenty five hundred dollar hat yeah you've got several among the very nice hats\nUh one of the things they also did which came first a Taliban or al ...

I was sitting with Diane Feinstein I Would say anything to get out of that\nThis uh they found this memory that she had repressed back in her mind\nBut drug it out of her and then of course they showed it to her and she said yeah yeah that's like something probably happened to her and they just didn't imbedded in her brain that it was this guy somebody else she believes it brought it up yesterday at one of these panels on one of these shows at this repressed memory nonsense\nIt's about Ninety percent Maloney there are no repressed memories\nThat a psychiatrist can be a reason why they have these recovered members and that was a big deal back a couple of many years ago not real it's not a real thing it's not it may have they're probably some rare instances that has happened but it's not a common thing that somebody can\nWell if you're the ... now I can probably did repressed family out of your brain that you've got back there somewhere I don't think so\nI get every damn memory I ever had [laughter] you don't remember them all all the time no no not suddenly right here sitting here remembering everything that ever happened to you all through your life but if somebody\nBrings up the specific instance I can go now now that never happened I I yeah I remember that I'll go dig that are you all have to be hypnotized or a you know some mentally a minute manipulated\nBut it's it's kind of like a Google Search if you throw the word in there I'll Google Search it and it'll come up or\nYou just smell something you could smell ... or ... one day when I was ... you know wondering what do you\nHear a song songs would bring it back yeah some song will play a ... a memory will come back to you based on that saw\nA couple of questions are still linger and America is mind one of them of course is who was keeping a Lindsey Graham's testicles and it did they want 'em right back or are they going to let him where um for a while\nWe speculate is the John McCain death you got 'em all on a in a wheel and John McCain will them his or John McCain has inhabited his spirit from beyond the grave and suddenly at ... threw him like a skin puppet some of the other questions\nAre of course we've gone over before and after yesterday we still aren't any closer to finding out who what when when did it happen where did it happen who else was there\nHow did she get to the party and how did she get home and let's focus on that last question for a minute according to her she rushed out of the house after just being assaulted by two boys at a party\nAnd she was afraid she was going to die she was terrified she was traumatized probably crying and that ... that you know ... tears rolling down her face\nShe didn't have a driver's license it wasn't close to her house who drove her home she should be able to testify\nTo who it was she didn't and who ever it was should be able to testify about her emotional state moments after the incident happened when they got her in the car is what killed her credibility cannot hill you who it was\nAnd like you said I think she really\nBelieves her story she she and only she believes her story she knew she fully believes it\nBut here's the problem whoever Doug that out just kinda like dug up a\nPart of it and left the root system all and they didn't give her the background information that she needs to a flea up for the rest of us she named three people\nShe named gamut all his buddy\nHe's his neck but it wasn't that new one the other ... the bad thing the really the one that really make sure that bad it was her best friend in high school\nThat Leland some under the best friend goes I don't know the Kavanaugh guy and I never met him and I argued with them I don't remember that incident I don't remember that party I don't remember that situation\nIs our they got to get the feeling from just from the state much that they said she made that she was kind of like backing off going ah\nI don't want to be anywhere near this ms forward woman anymore you know she's not right\nI think she likes her because their friend lifelong friends and she's she ... she said I Believe her in other words she's letting everybody know grain mhm\nThat's what I'm saying she ... don't don't don't I don't want to get too involved with her anymore and I also don't want to get drug and our private hell on television over the world are going after this guy that I don't know I'd never heard of\nSo sorry I don't know how much money\nWhat would you know she got six hundred thousand dollars from go fund me I don't know how much George Soros gave her but she's probably for a college professor there wasn't really that well places probably sit and fat in sassy now for the first time in a long time money wise I'd\nLove to talk to somebody left me question somebody that has been in her class because she did not look intelligent enough to pass on intelligence to another human\nBeing I did hear from one kid that was in a class that she was one of the worst ever got to be she was in sorry but she was just outright stupid\nBut some of the things they asked her do you know what exculpatory do\nYou know the basics of psychology or what does that mean\nYou got that Dr put on your name is\nOne thousand dollars a jump around a lot\nWhat station is this anyway I just had it on\nAddress during Brett Kavanaugh expected to be sworn in this evening after vice president Mike Pence announced today's vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nYou don't believe her because you're not what you would just get woke like me or what I did was I went through a all of the\nYou know the the hearsay evidence of the the back and forth a day and after all that out this is how you got ... and then I looked\nAt a picture of Brett Kavanaugh\nFrom back in Nineteen Ninety eight I Believe it was when he was ... junior or sister to the prosecutorial Ken Starr in the Clinton sex abuse and I looked at the picture of this little ... judge the judge a man and I said\nOh ... ... feet if I ever seen one just waiting to go off a little did I Know that he had already gone all that sounds like one of those guys are like I I can tell you whether it's ... puts out or not by the way she walks well I've got that right now oh yeah [laughter]\nI looked into his eyes and that picture 'cause there's a huge story at that Kavanaugh was part of the prosecution of Clinton and you know but star and Monica Lewinsky we get all that stuff back in ... show the recording technically now so that means\nAll of these people or you know friends of bills fringe of Hillary's friends of George Soros and they all want to show this ... it it helps that this is a way to get Trump but it also helps and it's just a way to\nFinally get all real revenge Twenty years later on his cabin all sexual predator ... guy\nAnd everybody knows eventually Hillary gets hers sooner or later it's still coming back to hurt your climate in your car going to work and suddenly you smell smoke or\nDid you take that drink of iced tea and it's got like a funny change to it what is it a ... ... is that antifreeze\nHillary has a body count that said believe people that are about to testify against people that are they just had a terrible car accidents airplane actually\nNot even know his name and like everybody look under their chairs real question they get hold of a botulism sandwich something\nHappens to them so that was my phone strange thing happened earlier this week uh Lindsey Graham who we normally don't agree with much 'cause he\nGot a ... it kinda roared up and do it on his hind legs for a minute he laid out this position on his cabinet\nThing and a damn if he didn't do a pretty good job of a nail in this town tries to hear you say that I felt the same way though did you what\nAre they supposed to go interview everybody Maryland's summer I'm not saying\nThat's supposed to go every house in a certain town\nThere's nothing to be learned here\nFrom Nancy I guess you\nWere talking about appointing somebody to be in charge of the rule of law\nI'm going to stop the rule of Law Center\nIf this were a criminal allegation you would never get out of the batter's box because you can't tell the keys\nWhere it happened when it happened\nAnd there is no cooperation outside the accusation itself you could sue in civil court\nFor the same reason he could not even get a war\nSo our respectfully listen to the doctor for\nBut here's the question for me and others what is the standard [noise]\nWhat is it going to be are you really innocent\nOr guilty based on the accusation is there any presumption of innocence left in the confirmation process we have an accusation thirty five years old without any verification\nAnd I'm going to look at his entire life\nNot just this one moment in time in high school\nThat I don't know when it happened and where it happened and here's what I see from his entire life life will live and here's my understanding of this area the law\nIf you're a sexual predator if you're a serial rapist you don't just do it a couple of years and quit Harvey Weinstein's of the world\nAnd when you have the power over woman that's when you're most likely\nWhat I have a cat and now\nThat you've lived a damn good life that all the women who work for you that she has our over
