I Am a Texan from France a proud of who Sony and I love this city and one of the things that absolutely knocked\nMe over when I first moved here in Nineteen Ninety One was the story of how he ... built the war them center the opera house and the ballet house one of the most beautiful in the world by the way\nUh they did it in the middle of the real estate crash of the mid eighties private funding came in any way and the edifice was built and uh it added to downtown and editor Jones Hall and the alley theater and created one of the coolest theater districts in the city country actually [laughter]\nThey put on the forefront that the arts would be important for the city and uh when I moved here I didn't realize it that was true\nAnd there's another event that actually brings it home because they have to hold the twice that's how many people would be interested in participating and that is the bayou city art festival there doing it downtown so the bayou city art festival downtown will be coming October thirteenth and the fourteenth on both days Saturday and Sunday from ten to six PM\nAnd this is an opportunity not only to see a bunch of the great artist of Houston and smell the unknown up and coming artist because they give it a chance to young people in any one really who we can apply we'll talk a little bit about that\nA and an opportunity to really great food\nAnd to bring the kids and there's going to be a costume contest on Sunday night's gonna be the first time they do that and my guest today is Roger bear he is the executive director of the art colony association and Roger we should start by explaining that the art colony association is who produces the bayou city art festival\nDowntown [laughter] yeah that's correct thanks for having me later\nOn all you're more than welcome his or radio veteran which is fantastic you walked into the building and instantly recognize an old colleague from the channel thirty nine\nOf those people who got some really bad news just recently and we wish him look a lot of professionals were or were left high and dry unfortunately but yeah so you're actually someone who has a perspective on the development of the arts and the city you've been you've been looking at it\nYeah you know I'm an art lover music lover uh I like getting outside in our city and um yeah this we're in our forty seven tier of producing a festivals or it started as a west ... street festival yeah that I that I remember yeah\nAnd then we moved downtown and now we do to Venus a year we got downtown in the fall and and the spring we're a memorial park and that's actually a three day uh were Friday Saturday Sunday when we're in the park\nYou know if you say memorial park you're doing an art festival memorial park that sounds big if you do it downtown it can sound big but it depends on how many streets they close off how many blocks to secure\nThis is a huge event I'd the last time I went from my mother's birthday to celebrate her birthday\nOr we were able to walk from city hall to the war them\nWithout traffic they had locked off all those blocks we'll talk about parking they've made it very ESE there's even a\nThere's a ride share arrival points so if you decide to take one of those services they're going to bring you to a very convenient place a and this year the parking underground is going to be open that's one of the things will repeat this parking is going to be easy it's not going to be a problem\nUh there's going to be a lot of people obviously heading downtown so it's it's it's just huge festival honey blocks do you know how many\nAlong it's a big footprint um I think it's ten in total and we have part of the park too so it's kind of hard to figure out how many blocks the park is but yeah the footprint is big impulse spots in memorial park in downtown so\nIt's roughly the same number of artist with three hundred artist in both spots and we have eight bands um we've got music the variety is really amazing a\nRock and roll rolling Mary and she's absolutely you know they roam around a and there are unbelievable it's exactly what it sounds like rock'n'roll mariachi yeah\nSo I think that it had an electric guitars but of course they get to er I I'm with now they're traveling so there are ... so there are crucial but ... so they they add the rhythm of rock and roll yeah with traditional\nIt's something to be saying oh yeah totally amazing but we've got a same Turner and the cats cats are tighten up our to your area play Melton Jeff Paxton ... learner\nAnd teen oh and Jose

and then when you find him he's doing those things he said he believed in doing\nYou know and I think that there's a lot of that going on with the value city art festival\nIt's you you guys have decided to to\nPatron the arts is ... yeah absolutely the saying we need to fund these artists writers they provide and foreign service to society right and uh it's very difficult for them to get any exposure is very difficult for them to get off the ground and here they are three hundred strong hundred\nNineteenth disciplines so you've got you know traditional two dimensional art and a lot of that uh and you've got a lot of sculpture even sculpture that specifically built and designed to be outdoors which is\nReally there's some really wild stuff some ... ... yeah yeah so um we've got all

back and was roped off and we would sit back there and we would watch these black spiritual singers sing on Sunday like\nThe thing that gospel spiritual music brought to popular news it was the\nGospel spiritual music\nBut the guts and the feeling\nAnd the real soul into it\nAre people like Elvis Johnny Cash and Jerry Lewis and Carl Perkins all those guys buddy Holly if you will they saw

Sam is a changed person\nIn the commercial mean show would have a memorable encounter the trembling nine year old named\nMy mom and my dad were both in TV ads to our future whether whether we expect the rain to\nMy mom was ... my dad was a director and producer I started doing commercials probably when I was around five or so so by the time we did a commercial I probably done about thirty or forty commercials up to that point let's go to the old\nWhen the first day when he shot the commercial there was a lot of down time 'cause they're doing a lot of work to the set and uh because of that there wasn't a lot to do so of course I brought a football and went over to Joe and asked if he drove football around and he said sure\nHe developed a sweet little relationship autonomy and may tell me much more comfortable\n\nThey were trying to get them to drink the whole coke and they had an maybe do that a couple of times and just said there were going to the guy who's going to blow up after\nHe went through an awful lot of stuff [noise]\nAnd you know the the legend of course that he drank Eighteen sixteen ounce bottles equivalent to an airport a gallon\nTo savor storage

green Jersey that I still have this day\nBut Tommy was not the only child whose life would be positively influenced by Joe green here's Joe's wife ...\nI think it changed our lives a lot\nOf chains Jill\nPersonality a lot because so many kids when looking up to him he decided he really wanted to be a role model\n[noise]\n\nAppeared with the Muppets and probably Elmo and was on children's TV show\nWe're all in all I used to be my own show though and everybody told me that we will fully\nWell things like the officer ... jumping\nWe'd be walking around and little old ladies that I Know didn't know anything about ... would come up to Joe and Tamerlan you and I made\nThe ... the orange or or like in the\nThis day I'm Still rather amazed\nI mean it's the commercial that will not die\nAlthough he was known to the world is mean Joe\nYou know into his grandkids as papa Jo\nWe moved to a man named cookies and you saw me indirectly with the people and he was surprised\nThat I\nAsked him because we know your grandpa and then all these people are trying to talk to you and give you some little new used\nTo but at the same ... you know it's like\n\nThe father of three and

degrees\nIf it is hotter than that them we'll look at doing solar ventilation may be some ... air into the addict and we have to get the editor temperature down\nAnd there's different ways to do that and that's we've come out and do an addict analysis will come on look at the addict and you know the argument that do you when you come out you know so that kind of our first stage so people you know listen to the show today you can call\n'em will throw out a few we got some deals on some insulation as well but call us will come out and look at the addict and see what it actually needs 'cause it's it's hard to even just say you know old just in general over well installations which in ... well not necessarily people will say my air conditioner is not working anymore for ...\nWell that may be the case could be but maybe not so you know what are you gonna do best thing is is have somebody come look at it so called ... been doing this for Thirteen Years\nWe know what we're doing and we don't oversell people would just see what they need it would come out and we take care of it\nI'm going to give out Tom's number as to eight one nine three six zero five five nine to eight one nine three six zero five five nine Tom is the owner of that ad innovations he has actually come out to my home put insulation in point a solar addict fan in and you also put the draft master and that's what you call it don't you\nYeah the draft Messer the addict stairway and later it's for the poll downstairs and it just keeps the heat in cold\nIt really works great in the summer and it works just as well in the winter so if you're eating the house and heat rises so you don't want it that heat to just go right up to that addict or ... votes in insulator that will insulate then it's part of like when we do insulation it's actually insulating the door so it's really part of the insulation package and if it costs today will do will throw one of those in which is what the purchase of insulation\nAbsolutely fantastic to eight one nine three six zero five five nine on today's show top medic innovations is going to be talking about\nAttic insulation we're going to be talking about solar addict fans and radium barrier radium barrier also is actually good for the winter a lot of people think that must be a summer thing because there isn't that bounce the the sun's energy back out again right so we'll be talking about that here on the show before the break\nLet's talk about a deal you brought you always come to the show with a deal because you know that I check approach Joe require it so I hang upside down by his ankles I shake him the problem with that is Tom's a couple of inches\nTaller yeah you always begging my head and if you can visualize that sort of grants and my my ankle and bang bang bang\n[laughter] okay so are you brought a deal ordinarily it's a dollar Ninety per square foot for an eight inch ad of blown in certain seat installation the white stuff right yeah um and and so that's a that's deep eight inches and that's generally what people need to get up to the value of north thirty eight is now within\nA year so not most houses are going to have five to six inches in there that hasn't been upgraded so will come in and that's what we find that's all you run that special on eight inches that normally we'll bring you to Thirteen fourteen inches when that'll be a really nice job uh we used it certain heat insulation doesn't it's class say fire rated uh\nIt doesn't absorb moisture mold doesn't grow on it it's a great insulator and we can add that to the existing inflation so you don't have to pull the old insulation out\nNow we do remove all if it's you know something that you've had squirrels and it's nasty but normally we don't need to do that Ninety five percent of the time we're just going to add insulation to what you have\nBut that is something that we do um but we don't encourage that push that on people some some places will say like every house that they got what we were we pull everything out every town now he's like you're spending your charging customers so much money you might have been a job that was maybe a Fifteen hundred dollar job and they're like oh we got twelve thousand that jump like\nKeep it that customer didn't need that that's if you need it you need it but in most cases you know that's crazy we don't operate like that\nWhen you're painting a room you don't scrape the paint off you know ... you don't actually you just go over it to eight one nine three six zero five five nine one dollar Ninety cents a square foot for an eighty and chat it's fifty percent off today everybody half price only Ninety five cents is that correct\nYeah Ninety five cents a square foot but they didn't shed and there were also throwing in the freezer Wayne Slater of the draft ... I've got one I Love it yep and those are normally two Ninety nine installed and those are made right here in Cairo Texas so it's really a nice ... ... people so we kind of use the local\nYou know products and try to support our local community with by doing that and it's a great product\nThat is huge two hundred and nine nine dollar value for the addict stairway insulated the draft master I loved that product because I'm ... and we've talked about this before time here on the show\nIf you don't have anything on your stairway door and you pull it down for instance and you look up it's it's just there but when you close it it has what a quarter inch of\nPlywood there that's all and less than an arwen value they're\nVery very low our values you're going to throw that in for free so if you want a free addicts their way into later in fifty percent off addict insulation from attic innovations\nHome out or how many callers today can we can do six six deals today to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you don't need this now don't clog up the phone lines because we've got people listening who want it [noise]\nCall now six people only to wait one\nNine three six zero five five nine if you didn't get the number we're going to repeat it during the break in time when we come after the break I Would remind me I Will after the okay to wait one nine three six zero five five Ninety six colors only we come back talking more of an attic insulation radium barrier and solar addict than\nCheck a pro Joe here how does your front door look does it need to be refinished I've got a deal for you my friends over it's dirty door refinishing is offering a fifty dollar off deal\nOn your front door refinishing ordinarily three hundred dollars now only two hundred and forty nine dollars it's a special check a pro deal and it's a limited time offer sturdy doors re finishing his authorized me to give away five of these deals today right now today on my radio show\nThe first five callers will get fifty dollars off their front door refinishing it's only two hundred and forty nine dollars you must call right now to eight one three seven seven for nine four or five get your front door looking brand new without buying a brand new door fifty dollars off color right now to eight one\nThree seven seven for nine four or five that's to eight one three seven seven forty nine forty five call now\nI ...

what\n[noise]\nApproach Joe here it's great to have you all listening to me and my friend Tom decker semantic innovations here on the check a pro radio show I was listening to one of those motivational\nSpeakers on you to the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that\nToo oh I get a kick out of those guys yeah yeah well you name it kind of jazz me up every once in a while one of them blew that gets you thinking yeah\nAnd so someone was talking about having a purpose okay and my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day is I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner finds the best possible contractor so on check a pro dot com we've checked their licenses insurance in references all one hundred plus contractors\nAnd is also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner\nI'm you're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need it you're not going to cut a hole in the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that month I'm right exactly it's actually you're kinda like a doctor I called the addict doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem\nAnd then you say what do we have to do as far as an operation pacemaker\n... one of ours is [laughter]\nThen and and so then you might recommend you know you need to fans and this is why and you have a rationale for it right um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe you need ten and this is why I'm\nYou need a radium barrier because you're in the primaries of Katy, Texas and you're getting\nBeaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house and you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nYeah the nice thing as soon as we do that it's a lifetime of energy savings and comfort so everything that we do is not some you have to do over and over again so if you do the writing a barrier that's a one time deal of do solar fans are fans have a lifetime or two so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come to replace the than\nThe insulation is guaranteed to settle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say well I'm In a remodel my kitchen for something like well they're ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen aid remodeled again because it's out of date\nIt goes out of style will insulation in what we do never goes out of style nobody ever says boy you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nAnd they want to you know what I'm saying it's like you want it to be as efficient as you can eat out you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient attic you don't want to go back you realize what a difference it's really made because I get calls all the times like would you really think\nYou know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation is going to make it a big difference and like you ma'am you only have two inches of oh wow this is going to be huge now if you already had Fifteen inches of inflation is somebody trying to tell you you need eight more and then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference now is up and make a big difference because you're already you're already there\nBut if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be it's going to make a big difference in the lower temperature it does make a big difference in the house\nLike I said it makes it more comfortable air conditioners going around less lower energy bills\nThe house can be quieter with more insulation it's good peace of mind just knowing that everything is the way it's supposed to be I'm kind of into that people say what do you mean peace of mind it's like well you just know that it's it's correct you go to sell the house\nYou're not would like to ... somebody in and saying well here's the house was great and you know one of my gosh the wiring shot the addicts horrible the air conditioners on its last legs you don't want to sell somebody that something like\nThat it depends on their desperate situation you might need\nGuess maybe if I ever but see that's why you get stuff taken care of as you go in and do it right like I say I was in the house yesterday and we were doing a removal and they were so happy and they're like you know what we were\nSo I guess some things to go down you know I had my ... you're not shrinking yet but but the point is if you live to be long enough you're shrink I went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and I said you've lost twenty pounds is twenty Fifteen I'm like oh ... I wasn't even trying to lose any way but you know these addicts are hot as tough [laughter]\nTen more years I'll be twenty last [laughter]\nSolar addict fans a great deal from the federal government Uncle Sam is giving you thirty percent off what a\nYeah so you get thirty percent off of the of the installed price so you get thirty percent of the product and the installation so it really helps bring the cost down or I go over the numbers real quick and then I'll talk about the benefits of the fan\nSo we do a thirty ... solar addict fan is made by the people like I said they're out of condo Texas I'm a thousand Ninety five dollars is the normal or normal installed price were taken two hundred dollars offer checker Pearl listeners celebrates it costs down eight Ninety five out the door installed\nLifetime warranty the whole kitten caboodle so that's a great deal but then the government's also kicking in thirty percent federal energy tax credit to get thirty percent of that back on your twenty Eighteen taxes so that the two hundred and sixty dollars and fifty cent tax credit so brings the total cost to six twenty six fifty after the tax credit\nSo just to be clear the day we do the the fan it would be eight Ninety five\nOf the editor innovations and then you get to sixty eight fifty back in the tax credit so your your true out of pocket expenses six twenty six fifty so the nice thing about that is these fans can pay for themselves in a year or sometimes even less just an energy savings because I've had customer say you know I have\nFour hundred dollar electric bill now my bills like two fifty in such a big difference in the summertime that that they get paid for the first summer it's incredible so the fans are really nice artist\nThe humidity sensor and the thermostat comes on eighty five degrees so it doesn't ... addict in the winter it's it's smart technology but it will be can't kick in in the winter if you have high humidity and run for Fifteen or twenty minutes pulled the humidity down\nIn reason you don't want a lot of humidity in the addict is because it can get in in an inflation and then the insulation starts to settle and then later on you need more inflation the whole reason was because you maybe didn't have enough to start with but if you did have enough too much humidity the insulation will basically shrink it's kind of contacting so you want to keep the editor in the air and he had a dry\nSo that's what the fans do I've got one you do I put it in ... I didn't even have my crew to it I came out when we were so busy we did it in the summer we were so slam as I can I already know where I knew where you live sauce like I'll come to it as a problem you know where I live right\nAnd I know yeah you um should meet up the ladder you put your cougar paws on which are special boots that roofers use and you went up and you look you look at you know what you're doing that's for sure\nI have done probably I Would say I was gonna say thousands but I'd say I'd probably put in at least a thousand of myself so I Am very familiar with solar fans and my cruise they've done thousands of them we put a lot of fans in\nBecause they do make such a big difference to lower the addict temperature so that's the number one reason you put a solar fan in is to lower the addict temperature the lower the temperature and the addict\nThe less the air conditioners going to run and the more comfortable house becomes so if you're addict as a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty degrees and you're trying to cool the house down is Seventy five degrees inside that's a Seventy five degree differential\nYou're ... you just can't over what we can't take that much heat out of the house so it gets overwhelmed with heat that's why there does your does runs it runs in runs so I tell people you know you drop the temperature down to see a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen that's going to make the biggest difference that you can't as far as efficiency on your whole house it's all about addict temperature\nIt's huge how many of these can you give a wave of or I'm Sorry how many deals can you offer to my listeners\nAre saying hey let's do a we can do six of these so we'll do six than deals with this deal so now some houses may need to fans so this'll be six separate appointments so if you need to find some people say well I think I Need to a federal do up to about Fifteen hundred square feet you have a twenty five hundred square foot addict or we can recommend to fans so this kind of let people know about what the pricing it'd be\nSo you know you'd normally one or two faces which neat\nOkay ordinarily a thousand Ninety five correct yes two hundred dollars off from my ... thank you very much time for offering that to my listeners today\nSo that brings it down to eight Ninety five installed yes and then the federal tax credit from the federal government Uncle Sam thirty percent off which is to sixty eight fifty nets it down to six twenty six fifty after the federal tax credit\nYes that's out of pocket so that's the nice thing about that and this is the same thing it's a lifetime product lifetime warranty it's a great fan it has a a motor that that's a rabid at Ninety thousand hours so it's about thirty five year run expectancy on that motor\nI Wonder how long my motor ... I'm I'm pointing to my I Hope you have in our life I Hope you have that\nI don't know you're getting cut out there I envy not thanks not skewed if you're All right if you're ... the same age as me if

our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list\nMagnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with that what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it\nReally because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually take into account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nBlend that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting a muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this\nEnd of the system the formula we have the count max formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink is cut down\nThis great my absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this was probably a good

the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are the fish and vitamin D\nThe fact is is that

comes down to here as we're not getting the right form or enough vitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms\nOf vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D\nVitamin D three is the activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and\nVitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties that's the way you know you start and more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling that you can't golf you can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and I know of clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath of the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this\nBecause a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that and the sooner you can get on my formula better you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here I Know\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and Dr ... what can someone expect when they start taking your fast melt the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the

particular point event is on the eighth or as we said at six o'clock in the evening event well there's some of the things that you need as are the folks who are doing this event by this point in time what are you looking for\n\nA well we got a ... there's a lot of moving parts to this is if you find out you know you got to have to argue that has the art auction one collect the style of auction

people aware of what's cooking as far as the anti or go\nWell thank you raise the just great to be honest with you and uh it to anybody listening to ask [laughter] well you know the ...\nI I you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna sit in a in this call you at the at least I Know it it might have been advertising worked and all that kind of stuff but it's been the editor for a long long long time because that's where it affects the rest of my heart but we know that that even the specialty or is it allows you to\nCome together and that always tell the work that has a gun through what I call a a difficulty pipeline but I mean by that is you don't have work better for the uh big honor they were worth getting an award\nOr you know one thing is actually you work with the other the other part of it is you know quantify selling it works here higher pipelines approvals that are sometimes not quite so easy on a on the client side\nUm and and then getting get Josh did you get what they are I think that that's you know it's just an average pivot he it's an honor to return to an audio clip of the process that is our ... right\nAnd then of course you've got the silver medal that celebrate that just creativity\nBut community involvement dedication education that the advertising I mean there's a lot that goes into a somebody be recognized but still the level\nSo it's a it's a pretty special night they make it a fireball with the er at federation which is today you know the old days it was called a JFK advertising federations\nWell there's another challenge okay and that's fine [laughter] you American\nAdvertising federation here but you know my first than Boston was it judge it was in in in entering the work you know I Need so literally my first involvement with the with the ad club was\nA you know being on my knees have logging work writing it down ... tree you know and the and actually it ended up\nUh giving me a perspective about the business I met some incredible people that are for the meat the day so it's a rat you you always had a really special place in my heart\nYeah it sounds like it'd be ... uh do hold a special place in your heart and and personally I mean I'm ... what ... means to you or your beyond beyond the the good feeling that you can walk away with an award or just participate but let's go a little bit deeper what do they mean specifically to you Alex\nWell to me particularly you know it's a\nIt is like I said earlier it is quite a ... who really create work that is a award or let alone would windy\nQuite a process you know from the outside the advertising business quite glamorous than\nLike oh we're still a half the cocktail hour and all that kind of stuff is just a you know you you offer up your baby really creative work\nYour clients for scrutiny and criticism or you know it's not a process copywriter what came out of your mind the soldiers on paper and make a you know changed and\nAltered so you don't you get these ... that are so hard work and the time to celebrate the tonight who\nWho gather a to look at everybody else's work or have to also realize that you're part of ... special\nPart of a creative humidity and I'm proud to fake Houston has one hell of a good creative you know it's a it's about ... again it's about the liberation of a gathering celebrate after the ... process and so it's a it's a pretty thick\nSo you've been around for quite a while is well how does the er and he's changed over the years what have you seen change their\nWell certainly the high school 'cause I I'm back in the day one of the biggest categories of the most competed in tough category was the annual report category believe it or not you know you had a you know art direction credit\nOr you know I mean there was ... it was a big rich\nPart of the part of the show a print category but they're going to end today the digital category the social category and technology has really impacted on them the categories and and but still it felt\nSo so I think that that's one of the biggest change that and then some things remain the same you know that that spirit of teamwork in celebration and a protection for the idea has never changed so you know something will never be the same in some things remain\nSo personally for you Alex how does it feel to walk up there and then walked down and have that Abby and your hands what does it mean what does it mean to you as\nWell it it's always been special you know we've been really blessed as an agency to\nTo have one our fair share a little more than our fair share over the years and it never gets old and you realize that can you know my ... it's not by ward it out and they belong as much to the folks that you have to work\nWith the folks that are the account planned or the brand leadership folks the folks that sold it protected it and then of course ultimately the client I think clients uh are asked proud of that work and if you are an agency and it is the agency's responsibility to share it\nWith clients so if there's anybody listening or that you know we're doing work that you feel that the be all worthy of recognition is what you're calling them share that movement because we live in their hearts liver your heart and the moment of connections between your creative than the ...\nThat is just oh that's just go\nTo ... that ran over to him to a

like working in the advertising industry and and you know that's always been a goal with this competition is to give them a taste of\nWhat all is involved in the field and what job opportunities they
