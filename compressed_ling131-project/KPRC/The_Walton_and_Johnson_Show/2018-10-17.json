CIA in at the end of the new to\nMe I never heard of that for that is a brand new to me that's a whole new thing I never heard that mentioned ...\nJulio Castro guy or whatever at at at home that's good news 'cause he don't like the way things are going in this country where they were going great and then Trump got 'em all turned around and the wrong way\nThat's the way they see it that's why we keep saying this is an important election in November\nThe most important of your life may just to sit the Democrats down and shut their big mouths for a couple of days if you just sweep across the board a real Republican and when I think maybe just for a day or two\nThey might have to just sit down and shake their head and go oh who looks look America or don't want to\nBe called me and I know that's too there's too much commonsense there that's not the way they were Democrats will handle it they'll they'll come up and they fight you got to admit they fight hard and they fight United Nations better it Republicans inviting so I Hope people take this threat seriously because like here in Texas at\n... work or oh boy all the money behind this guy is coming from everywhere but\nTexas it I mean he is majority of it I Know it comes from multiple faith and they do have a way to filter that from one state to another to get it here to make it look better like it's coming from everywhere fever and paid for the California and New York mainly\nIn the northeast and a bunch of George Soros money yeah well that's George ... him what to do they're smart\nEnough George Soros and his ilk are smart enough not to just funnel it directly at California so they make it go out through Utah on a different you know others got\nThirty four different organizations with names on it that take away from the fact that it's him yeah he names um sweet like open borders\nJust saw it all sounds so wonderful that I'm pretty good I Know who who could be opposed to an open\nBorders a lay friendly and fun or or a progressive nation something\nOr other oh who doesn't want to be progress if that sounds good sweet smelling pretty flowers yes let's give some you know that a campaign yes and you go wow that sounds great by the way Chris who wrote us earlier and\nSaid that ah most ... I don't think Chris Mitt me I just felt like\nChris was talking about the rest of Europe but Jody\nEmailed inch in Jody I got to be a new donor anyway Geiger\nUh oh no down here says Joel ... support to know yeah he says guys I started listening to you all when you first came back to Houston and I was like Chris'\nFirst of all you took over suffer some guys that were I'm Kayla Kayla well that I liked him so I just couldn't stand Yalta first few times I'll listen but see I'm not a complete retard like Chris so I decided to give you some time\nAnd a looks like I've been a loyal ten percent or for uh like the last couple of decades\nAnd whatever now hey the complete retard actress now or are they are very fascinating the fact that they hate something like yet will listen to it\nTo hate it and enjoy the Haiti\nAnd and the hate it so much is that instead of turning their back on it or they want to embrace it with a with a warm email instead of just the\nChange the channel let it go and felt the need to speak up because you know when you tell somebody how much they suck they're definitely going to change to try to say what you want yeah it's kind of like ah they brought this up yesterday\nAbout Lindsey Graham gone on television shows and saying that that guy who was the prince and Saudi Arabia\nIs no it's not there to be a world leader needs to step down and go away and that's not Lindsay's a job to appoint moral leader they know this and it's seldom ever works out like that [laughter]\nSo what you're Lindsay's used to this employing the armed forces to overthrow of Saddam Hussein or a\nA Moammar Gadhafi type and we know how that turned out in the past Everytime you overthrow them you get something worse in their place yep so Trump's gone that's just calm down see how this works out it's really not our place\nTo tell another country who their leaders got to be that's the whole point it is not our place to tell other countries who their leaders is supposed to be in this particular case it's not even about an election that may have been tampered with now it's like Kevin the\nQueen of England now that that's really not fit to be a running England\nOr early ... royalty anymore they just step off we've been watching you and you're not being a very good king we need a new king of ... right right away\nThey do things differently in the middle east the entire region of the world they always have done things a little differently and it's just never been our place to straighten up\nTrump's uses logic and logic has been missing from the presidency probably said [noise] I don't know since Kennedy was air gas ... much credit longtime yeah at least Reagan\nBeen missing a long time so Trump says things like well you know what was your was your cancel the arms sales we do to Saudi Arabia and Trump's I held on hold on things like that what three hundred million dollars or the arms sales to this one country said you know how many Americans have jobs because of that one guy like factoring into this he said\nAnd and the other thing is if we deny them\nTalking to death over there the other day he said you know they had a prior\n[noise] Mm\nForty years ago this was the number one and that\nClearly hear Michael in their young\nBut you never hear Tito\nNumber on this date in Nineteen Seventy I don't know does understand this is the ... ... it's always just bill we've been eye ... eye to this day I think most underrated musician of all time\nI think Tito was moving his lips\nAnd it was like ... ...
