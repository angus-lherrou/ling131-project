Houston PA Houston's public affairs show anti heart media broadcast\nArtist famously the opinions express on this show do not necessarily reflect those held by this radio station it's management staff ... any of its advertisers [noise]\nMy name is low wrong I Am the Texan from France proud who stone in I used to come here when I was a kid\nLiving in France my mother who was from Houston uh brought us here a few times my sister and I and we were talking about little kids so uh I even went trick or treating as Caspar the friendly ghosts\nOf one year I was maybe five six there are some pictures have some memories and I remember the streets flooding when we had a thunderstorm of the likes I'd never seen in France I mean it was biblical\nBut to me as a little kid and then the streets flood so fast in Houston that it felt like the car with sometimes float around a bit it was really frightening\nThose were my first clash is my first encounters with Houston culture all those really friendly people in the neighborhood opening their doors to all these kids and uh I like that as a image of American hospitality especially in the south especially in Texas where people thought the command she\nUh and uh the Mexicans and the French were fighting each other there was a a tradition of helping the neighbor because that was often the only way you could survive and that's not ... literally like I'm going to die in my family is going to die without the help of my neighbors and so this area has been built on that kind of spirit and\nI think it sometimes takes an expatriate or an immigrant to really recognize it or at least to be constantly reminded of it I see it all the time the friendliness of the southerners in this country is something which\nStill surprises me is not the uh wow I didn't expect it but it's just this constant feeling that people are nicer here\nThan they would ordinarily be in other parts of the country and I've always loved that and we're gonna talk about that because I have a guess from the heritage society there are online at heritage society dot org\nMike Vance is a program director for the heritage society he's also a published author is the author of murder and mayhem in Houston available anywhere you can find books my\nCat and I have already been talking before the show started and I've already you learn some things you guys are in a way of preserving or do you like holding this candle of human ... human pride in the Houston area\nThat's the that's the hope we have our goal is to be the go to place for Houston history\nAnd we teach that through the houses that we have historic buildings ten historic buildings down there which you can visit yes these old one of them is an old pioneer house I mean the the lights you would see in a John Wayne yes the oldest building in Harris County or we call it old place but it was a the Williams house and it moved from clear creek\nUp to Sam Houston park downtown in Nineteen Seventy\nA but it's the oldest building in Harris County albeit not on its original location how they move they put on a flat that just it really is small it's not that big a we also have the oldest building in Houston\nWhich is on its original location a and that's the killer noble house it's original foundation I understand yeah how was that ... seven forty seven\nSo how is that possible because Houston is built on silt that's why the streets flood here we're basically a muddy marsh the prairie\nIt could be a prairie and that's just not a small let's call it a ... because that's what yeah yeah we dropped the trees and it used to be a beautiful prairie or the house is doing well we just actually had the foundation stabilized a little bit just re done a little bit\nUm we do have a pump down in space or because it's air conditioned now and that air conditioning is underneath a house in a crawl space and when we dug down and build a foundation it require to pump\nWater is not that low for that far beneath the surface here so uh how did it make out how that all these structures make out during Harvey ... pretty well except for one um the ... house or below that we were talking about\nImmigrant and it's an Eighteen sixty eight house used to sit where the George R brown is today okay and it's been in our park since Nineteen sixty five\nAnd it's the lowest down toward the by you and we raised after Allison it took eleven feet of water and Alison so we raised it up fourteen feet built a bomb raised it up higher and higher became and it's still got about eight inches of water\nOK so not too well the thing is is that wants to the water comes in if it's an edge it's really really bad yeah at least it's beneath\nRight we've done the repairs um the floor actually did nicely inside and ... now works did a because it was not made with that great Cyprus lumber\nUm but the porch has been replaced since then and a repairs have been made we're not going to put valuable collections back into it but we'll use it for programming\nOr maybe some temporary art exhibits that are up high on the wall or some live performances things like that\nIt's worth noting that you can just go and look at these houses from the outside but the interests of the museum is really inexpensive and there is in fact I'm using with a bunch of artifacts ... you're trying to demonstrate how people live back in the Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds\nOr which is a part of history that uh we don't know much about writing and you can also if you are down there when you're not\nWe're not open for tourists you can take a cell phone to her oh so called the number and that's totally free and he's a little description about the houses\nIt's fantastic and we have video\nOr our YouTube channel what'd you produce yes YouTube dot com slash the heritage society on YouTube you have to put the the front yeah um and that will get you some of the houses um have a video showing the inside and a little more extensive history about them and all kinds of other Houston history as well\nAnd you guys are working on a really really cool project there used to be a festival in time which was bigger than the Mardi Gras ... that we know in Galveston and it was called not Sewell yep Houston spelled backwards\nOh I didn't even you've said it five or six times before we started recording and didn't even occur to me a look at it that way what you have to\nSee it in print yeah everything's backwards spelling or it was ruled over biking not talk which has gotten spelled backwards\nAnd we have updated it a little bit but it was in operation from Eighteen Ninety nine to Nineteen Fifteen and it was a full festival unlike Mardi Gras earlier in the year and it was to celebrate\nThe commerce of Houston it started out with plants and flowers and cotton and it grew into all things commercial\nBut it was a big party they had a mid way that\nPeople came in from all over the region where does midway or like a carnival comes from a fair in Chicago Nineteen Ninety three but\nWithout going down that rabbit trails [laughter] carnival where that easy you just mentioned and people would come in we had a a population at the time of like Seventy five thousand people and it would draw that much more because everybody's coming into town for the giant party\nSo they would come from miles away sometimes they fill up a wagon and travel for a few days to come and sell some of their wares and party and Houston mostly the\nParty there every day just like New Orleans Mardi Gras are all these different crews although they weren't called cruise\nI'm the king and queen arrived on the first day by water there was a water parade and they got off at the foot of main street out of buffalo by you and then paraded through the streets and my personal goal is that a five years from now we can get back to that\nAnd the water parade yeah right on the ... uh I don't know if people realize that the the buffalo value is used for entertainment people kayak on it all the time\nAnd there are there's even a race there's a major race every year I Can't remember what it's called uh but uh it is a waterway that is usable\nAnd uh I've always thought that it would be really nice to have a water vote restaurant the way you see in the European city I recognize that the by you might be too narrow though it really it it looks big but as soon as you put a\nAn actual vote on it it turns into a small waterway my when I started um they used to bring some pretty big steamboats up here big wheels yeah yeah or familiar or see on the Mississippi absolutely\n... of for the most part and they would have to turn around and why do by you right there were main street\nHits the by you they would do a three point turn your back on the suburban out of a tight parking space\nAnd that's how they would turn around to get back downstream did they have a bunch of guys to push the boat off the ... at first when Houston started and it's being advertised as this great port yeah\nI'm there all kinds of stories about people coming up the by you and having to jump out and poll old logs and things out of the by you\nThere are instances of people getting off in walking\nBecause it was faster than the progressive [laughter]\n[laughter] there are some remarkable stories on the plus side um they talk about the the perfume from the magnolia blossoms and they said the magnolia trees overhang the by you with this incredible overpowering sent from those flowers\nWe're talking about a value that didn't look anything like what it looks like today I just learned recently did all these oak trees really shouldn't be where they are they it depends on what part of\nTown you're in yeah I'm Houston is where the ... was the term they use the tiny woods we call it now where that meets the prairie so in the northern part of the city uh it was what it it came down on the north side of buffalo by you and went out into what we know is the memorial area\nBut haunted houses aren't the only activity for adults on Halloween from the two million people attending New York city's Greenwich Village Halloween parade [noise] to the half a million attending West Hollywood Halloween carnival\nThe holiday takes a walk on the wild\nAnd not east side [noise]\nIf you look at the costumes that are so to adult these days the costumes are women are all of borderline prostitute cost to the ... made the sexy anything [noise]\nClearly a lot of women want to have a very sexy five of them\nAnd it's only on Halloween that they bring it out maybe you know they can do a little more often [noise]\nNot surprisingly alcohol plays a huge role in Halloween popularity so much so that by the Nineteen nineties beer sales for Halloween surpassed both the super bowl and St Patrick's Day\nHalloween popularity is also due to the fact that it in ... the American obsession with self transformation being who you aren't or who you would like to be\nSecretary just remain on high alert today\nAnd justice Halloween as scared kids for years Halloween scares parents to stop the fear sending their kids out into a hostile world of trick or treat full of poisoned candy and razor blade riddle apples\nReynolds is our police confirm it with a razor blade found in a piece of candy they're recommending\nYou know all of your children's candy and inspect each piece\nI grew up hearing about razor blades in apples myself\nAnd it's clear to recall a contemporary Roger in literature was urban was a there was a great societal unease about this idea that we're going to go to Kerry from strangers so there's a lot of stories about razor blades in apples or a new source of feathers on average every year and a very very worried about it [noise]\nDidn't razor blades in apples ever happened a couple of cases but of course you can ask which came first story or the actual\nRazor blades in apples Jack o lantern\nSoul king [noise] they make up the legend the texture of the Halloween we know today Halloween wears many mass [noise] yet it still remains the domain of kids [noise]\nWhen you're a kid you had one Ninety year were you were in charge you got to dress up you've got to be something that you usually worn and you kind of even got paid for the privilege him he was an amazing um [noise]\nClosely and you will see Halloween is a showcase for everything the human race fear\nThe centuries we learn to live and pain that which scares us most\nIs an invigorating it's central is the freedom to it that is very very enjoyable\nAt the same time it's ritual eyes she can do this at a certain time a certain place some of the images of Halloween decorations if people want to put them out at any other time of year the neighbors would call the police but Halloween you're allowed to take these very disturbing kinds of ideas and deal with them directly there's great liberation integrates them the freedom to that\nIt is on this day of freedom that Americans turn their fears into fun [noise] I'm Greg hang\nIn we here in our American stories would like to wish you and yours are very happy and safe Halloween [noise]\nAnd great job is always on that Greg [noise] and my favorite part about I'd read horse or and I was an American look major I did\nNot know you can do\nThe jacko entering into America\nAgain back to those details growing a lot of work goes into pieces like this and you can hear all that we do here in our American stories going wow American network\nHas zero authority and\nIt was so powerful this radio station that you could take up residence boat and go outside and hold it up Mayer would glow\nOf car would pull up to the radio station the lights would stay on they never used it during the daytime she during the daytime and I honestly a cane way down here you know should they may know says even with all that power you'd only reached San Antonio you know what I mean ... they waited till the nighttime game you know\nThen they scoot that sucker out all over the world but when they turned it on during the daytime to test out the transmitter birds would come flying Georgia shoes [noise] boom\nAnd they go run out and grabbing cook it ... really they used to get these the Enbridge fined by the turn on the trans ... they have supper made you know what I mean\nA car driving from New York to Los Angeles would never lose the station beaming out a two hundred and fifty thousand\nFive times the U.S ... could be picked up all over North America [noise]\nAs far away as you're\nIn the Soviet Union\nOr the new record on normally it was an oldie I'm going to play in if it's a fresh shot is nobody ever heard I'm going to play

Seventy six begins part one the siege\nFor the first year so we kind of figuratively speaking corrupt right in the darkness as far as figuring out how you do that you know I wrote a six hundred page shot and then it got to the un and realized was utterly worthless you know close up and he walks in the room I mean what are you going to do with that and then figure\nOut okay no story boards that's how the professionals do it yeah yeah and it was sort of bias no says the filmmaking on the fly\nFilmmaking on the fly can sometimes get a little dangerous especially when kids are in charge one day and there was a fire on the ...\nMost of the terrorists we shut my mom's basement which had this big rambling basement multiple rooms [noise] so ah we would\nWe'd only shoot in the summertime um you know it was like summer camp you know we we do production pre production during the school year but during the summer that was our time so I'm\nThink a hundred and twenty percent humidity typical Mississippi summer day I'm gonna start early and um [noise]\nAnd a son her down to the basement where [noise]\nYou know made up like a Nepalese saloon my dad's old wine bottles lining the lining the or the shelves and and Jason are cameramen as wiring up squelch the Gulf and the wall um [noise] and ah [noise]\nWe have a you know the\nThe Nepalese saloon nearly burns down down\nOur moms and shut us down in the previous summer because well\nThe auto show me with my back on fire and for some reason I had a problem with us so they let us continue with a two words adult chaperone and found an adult even less responsible than we were [noise]\nAnd so um he helped us a guy to do when you know there wasn't a fire in certain edges the frame you know more more gasoline over there it's a wonder we didn't bring house down don't try this at home catch\nWhen making a film being in Hollywood or Mississippi there are several stages of production there's pre production shooting and post production here again is Eric on the reproduction efforts to build this monumental tribute shown\nFirst summer was entirely nothing but pre production drugstore board scouting locations casting costumes props year or two we finally shot kept none of it because again we didn't know anything about so many [noise]\nUm [noise] so there's very few shots at that we actually kept from that first year but there are certain things that we just which over and over and over again\nThrough a trial and error we slowly picked up\nThings about a learning about composition lighting blocking acting and bit by bit we got better and only when we're satisfied with the quality of a shot\nIn the scene would we move onto the next\nNow these kids are obviously determined to get the film made but there was another major hurdle that they have to overcome back in the early eighties and that was just simply having access to the film that they were trying to recreate\nWe only actually saw the movie a few times you know a\nA N worked pretty much from memory for the first handful of years until the film actually came out on laser disc in eighty four\nAnd so we cobbled together [noise]\nAbsolutely everything that we could in terms of you know raiders paraphernalia you know a story books and magazines and and bubblegum cards and and all that stuff the comic book and the screenplay and and to the best of our memory sat down and and Eric [noise]\nYou know chiseled out well over six hundred individual story boards that we've been used as a blueprint but we you know\nWe went back to the theater as much as we could [noise] but [noise] um\nYou know for those of us who remember the eighties there were\n... video stores were really in there and to see that you couldn't really go down and read whatever you want it you know um there was an availability issue you know and and it was a movie when they can re release things so when the movie was released in the theater we went back and watched it you know again as much as our you know allowance would allow\nFor the boys ended up finishing their seen by scene remake of regions of the Lost Ark with their big premier out an auditory\nThe local Coca Cola bottling plant in Gulfport, Mississippi\nNineteen eighty nine [noise]\nBullet Arabs they lie and Jason lamb just finished an eight year recreate the trio premier their version of Steven Spielberg raiders of the last time\nI have two major and how many TV [noise] it's the hardest thing I've ever done so far we've been following this story off and on for the past three years if you are seen by turning back the hands of time I think one take one [noise]\nIt was shot out of sequence of due to his long filming period many actors randomly appear at different ages throughout the course of the film they completed every scene in the film except for one [noise] too complicated and expensive for the kids to convincingly pull off [noise]\nIt's the scene from raiders were Indiana Jones isn't a fist fight with a big ball knocks you next door an airplane with rotating propellers at the last moment when India is getting his ass kicked the Nazi gets hit by the planes propeller and shredded into a million buddy pieces that splattered all over the side of the airplanes [noise]\nIt's a pretty good ethics shuttering it's only seen the\nKids couldn't match after setting mom's basement on fire it was probably a good idea to nix the death by propeller see\nThe boys went their separate ways going off to college in the film was largely forgotten till two thousand three when the film producer got his hands on the copy of the remake here's Chris on the film getting discovered all those years later\nI didn't even tell my wife has an Indiana Jones said so she had no idea that I had even done this raiders thing and so when it got discovered in two thousand and three\nAnd like exploded you know and got us into Vanity Fair and we were all sitting touring around the United states and going to Germany and Australia and you know my wife was like I'm so much for the raiders thing you know I mean can you like let me see it\nYou know like a it's like this thing\nAnd you know I still have that like [noise] that reaction and she's like this is cool this is great\nSo this little remake of raiders of the Lost Ark born out of the sweltering summer heat of the Mississippi swamp country a couple of kids with nothing better to do [noise] suddenly have the attention of Holly\nEach of us um received very\nKind letter from Mr Spielberg thanking us for a very loving and detailed tribute and uh my wife actually\nYou know sort of got me in various stages of opening the letter and just sort of like [noise] gazing down stationary Steven Spielberg and you know [noise]\nSignature and you know this my boyhood hero who I spend my entire childhood\nEmulating is is work um [noise]\nCan't get any better than this but I was wrong um you know jump for a year and we've been screening and written up in

listening to one of those motivational\nSpeakers on you to the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that too oh I get a\nKick out of those guys yeah yeah they they kind of jazz me up every once in a while when I'm filmed blew it gets you thinking him and someone was talking about having a purpose okay and my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day as I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner\nFinds the best possible contractor so I'm checker pro dot com we've checked their licenses insurance some references to hold one hundred plus contractors\nAnd is also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner I'm\nYou're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need it you're not going to cut a hole in the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that month I'm right exactly it's actually you're kind of like a doctor I go to the doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem\nAnd then you say what do we have to do\nAs far as an operation pacemaker [laughter] shut of ours is that [laughter]\nThen and and so then you might recommend you know you need to fans and this is why\nAnd you have a rationale for ... um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe you need ten and this is why I'm you need a radium barrier because you were in the primaries of Katy, Texas and you're getting beaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house\nAnd you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nYeah the nice thing as soon as we do that it's a lifetime of energy savings and comfort so everything that we do it's not some you have to do over and over again so if you do the writing of barrier that the one time deal or if you do solar fans are fans have a lifetime ... so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come to replace the fan\nThe insulation is guaranteed to subtle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say well I'm going to remodel my kitchen for something like\nWell ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen each remodeled again because it's out of date it goes out of style will insulation in what we do never goes out of style nobody ever says well you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nAnd they want it to you know what I'm saying it's like you want it to be as efficient as you can eat on it you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient attic you don't want to go back you realize what a difference it's really made 'cause I get calls all the times like would you really think\nYou know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation is going to make it a big difference and like you ma'am you only have two inches of in oh wow this is going to be huge now if you already had Fifteen inches of inflation is somebody trying to tell you you need eight more and then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference now is up and make a big difference because you're already you're already there\nBut if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be yeah it is going to make a big difference in the lower temperature it it does make a big difference in the house like I said it makes it more comfortable\nAir conditioners going to run less lower energy bills\nThe house can be quiet or what the more insulation it's good pizza mine just knowing that everything is the way it's supposed to be I'm kind of into that people's like when he me peace of mind is like well you just know that it's it's correct you go to sell the house\nYou're not would like to ... somebody in and saying well here's the house is great and you know my my gosh the wiring shot the addicts horrible the air conditioners on its last legs you don't want to sell somebody that something like that it depends\nOn their desperate situation you might need\nI guess maybe if you rent but see that's why you get stuff taken care of as you go in and do it right like I say I was in the house yesterday and we were doing a removal and they were so happy and they're like you know what we were just going to add some inflation and there but the old stuff smelled so bad there that are like you know what let's just do it right I see yeah 'cause what happens if we come here and put ten inches of inflation in here\nAnd it still smells because you didn't pull the old stuff out now we have to take everything back out all that installations junk\nSo you spent all that money and now we're gonna have to go ahead and do it right so let's just do it right the first time\nIn eighth grade we did the job and they were ecstatic I mean so that's that's how we do things and we just won't do it right the first time were very reasonable and we'll make and we always say will make it work so really no matter what people's budgets are will work something or it doesn't have to be because we can do it stages we can do inflation now maybe a solar fan later\nUm if you want to do them all together and maybe we'll give you a little bit bundle all deal but we try to make things work so that's that's how we do it\nTom and his team will come out for free do a free attic analysis here's this number to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nTo eight one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly six people were able to get the addict insulation deal that we talked about earlier in the show we might circle back later and maybe Tom we'll throw in a few more of those deals but for now that's done but if you're interested in having a free addict analysis and radiant barrier because I Want to go into that next and Tom has a deal to eight one nine three six zero five five nine\nRadium barrier it's a great product to have when you don't have protection on your roof if you've a dark roof like I Do it's getting beaten all day long and it is absorbing heat you want that hate to be reflected back out radium barrier can do that [noise]\nTom brought a deal and I'm going to talk about the deal now then you have Tom go into reading a barrier more depth [noise] this is a great deal it's a low two dollars per square foot but Tom is offering fifty percent off and it's only a dollar a foot that's crazy ... square foot\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before someone as a two thousand square foot house and his two stories\nTheir attic is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet exactly so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the radical and they can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah will measure it because most people have kind of an idea that I think it's about twelve hundred feet or or whatever is in like OK and will measure it and it's like yeah sure enough that's right um that's kind of the normal will just come out with you a quick measure makes sure where everybody on the same page\nAnd we'll get them the exact price would give them the quote right on the spot a so we don't say whoa email to you and then in two weeks you finally get it and all that kind of stuff will give you the price right there in ... so you know right where you stand\nAnd that way you can say you know while the radio was\nSay say the radio was twelve hundred and the inflation was a thousand and you you could say well I could I could do one or the other which one do you think would be best and then we can make a decision and we can talk over the options the pros and cons of of each so that's why I like to give prices right on the spot so people know where they stand and they can make an educated decision versus just saying if I just emailed them over all the pricing later\nThen but they they don't know which way to go because\nWe're not there and we can't really talk about it and yeah it's better to get it out and we'll sit down even if it takes an hour to to go over well we'll talk to you and we'll figure it out or most of our appointments really allowed to take about thirty to forty five minutes will come up in the attic\nTakes maybe ten minutes ago everything we have him if you want to chit chat and you know give us cookies or something will will do that too but it doesn't take long to do this process we're not there to keep\nYou know banging on your end and making you want to buy something I had a a company come out one time they were trying to sell me a some stuff from my house and they were there for four hours like this is ridiculous and just like what are you guys doing say\nThey don't let them do our our our ... you know you didn't say yes that's why they're there for four decades kept saying oh it's like you know I think that people have said well we're going to think about ... I'm going to talk to my wife when she gets on them like great does fine let's let me know if she has any questions give me a call it I'll give you my cell phone number\nAnd we'll just you know I'm happy to I'm happy to leave it's like your your call me back and we're just confident we're going to get the business of the customer is actually going to do an addict\nJob we're going to get to work because our reputation is so solid\nFifty percent off the radiant barrier today he block ultra\nIt's not two dollars today that's normal price but here on the check a pro radio show for my listeners is only a dollar per foot dollar per square foot fifty percent off to eight one nine three six zero five five nine how many of these are you giving away today\nOr one can do for those reasons we do a little less on those because we have to do radio ... in the morning because he just gets too hot and the on and tells you the radiant work uh so we limit that a little bit more ... will do for the\nFour to eight one nine three six zero five five nine for callers only\nI'm so radium barrier is something that um some of my listeners will need to order for me when some won't and that is because um for the past handful of years builders have put them in New bills\nAll the new construction has radiant bear the houses six or seven years old or you know we're older than that then there's a good chance they they don't have already had barrier\nAnd if you don't have already Barrett then there's probably an eighty percent chance that we would recommend it enough reason we wouldn't recommend it is the houses just completely covered in trees ... you know you just don't have that rating energy hitting the roofs of why would you need it\nOr um if you are getting some sunlight but you we have unbelievable ventilation and the addict\nSent off of the of the installed price so you get thirty percent of the product and the installation so it really helps bring the cost down\nOr I go for the numbers real quick and then I'll talk about the benefits of the fan I'm so we do a thirty ... solar addict fan made by the people like I said they're out of conrail Texas I'm a thousand Ninety five dollars is the normal or normal installed price were taken two hundred dollars offer check ... nurse\nSo it brings the cost down to eight Ninety five out the door installed\nLifetime warranty the whole kitten caboodle so that's a great deal but then the government's also kicking in thirty percent federal energy tax credit to get thirty percent of that back on your twenty Eighteen taxes so that the two hundred and sixty dollars and fifty cent tax credit so brings the total cost to six twenty six fifty after the tax credit\nSo just to be clear that they would do the the fan it would be eight Ninety five\nOf the editor innovations and then you get to sixty eight fifty back in the tax credit so your your true out of pocket expenses six twenty six fifty so the nice thing about that is these fans can pay for themselves in a year or sometimes even less just in energy savings\nBecause I've had customers so you know I have four hundred dollar electric bill now my bills like two fifty in such a big difference in the summertime that that they get paid for itself to for summer it's incredible\nSo the fans are really nice ours has um humidity sensor and the farmers that comes on eighty five degrees so it doesn't pull ... attic in the winter it's it's smart technology but it will it can kick in in the winter if you have high humidity in run for Fifteen or twenty minutes pulled the humidity down\nIn ... and you don't want a lot of humidity in the addict is because it can get in in an inflation and then the installation starts to settle and then later on you need more inflation the whole reason was because you maybe didn't have enough to start with but if you didn't have enough you had too much humidity the insulation will basically shrink is kind of contacting so you want to keep the editor in the air and he had a dry\nSo that's what the fans do I've got one you do I put it in ... I didn't even have my crew to it I came out what we're so busy we did it in the summer we were so slam as I can already know where I knew where you live so I think I'll come to it probably know where I live right\nAnd uh no yeah you um she made up the ladder you put your cougar paws on which are special boots that roofers use and you went up and you look you look like you don't you're doing that's for sure\nI've done probably I Would say I was gonna say thousands but I'd say I probably put in at least a thousand of myself so I Am very familiar with solar fans and my cruise they've done thousands of them we put a lot of fans in\nBecause they do make such a big difference to lower in the attic temperatures so that's the number one reason you put a solar fan in is to lower the addict temperature the lower the temperature and the addict\nThe less the air conditioners going to run and the more comfortable house becomes so if you're at it as a hundred and forty hundred and fifty degrees and you're trying to cool the house down to Seventy five degrees inside that's a Seventy five degree differential\nYour ... it just can't over what we can't take that much heat out of a house

damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWell we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list many of them is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium\nYour heart won't beat who very important factor in life you would say so in fact\nLet me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's not that they're really mess around with now what happens is that you need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the ... formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back\nPain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency spin\nThe nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nWhen that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones just start cutting bone loss you start getting 'em ... muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system the formula we have the count max formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a Coptic a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink is cut down\nThis great absorption rate\nIs really a incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nRight and this

wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all of the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone\nThat should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable network then of course with the

getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is\nThe activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the roof where should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ... people in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt\nBefore you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active and when you're in your fifties you start telling her you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on the formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and I May of clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pink is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath out in the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this\nBecause a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that and the sooner you can get on my formula the better you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here on off\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and Dr ... what can someone expect when they start taking your fast melts de three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something is changing and your body because the kick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less Shane having more energy\nAnd having

when we're out there it will be in the mid seventies and no rain\nOkay and you said that so and you're not a weatherman so that's probably going to come through I Would imagine I karma [laughter] your words are in full swing too as well as we roll into twenty Nineteen right\nYes they are or were again it will be at the Hyatt which we tend to use that facility quite a bit\nUh we are so looking forward to it um last year was a um I we did extremely well we had a lot of participation or this year we reduce the price of copper entries ended for a variety of reasons but more importantly\nA not only do we want more participation but we want more participation for some of the some of the smaller shops or some of the independent creative uh I Believe we were at the one Seventy five before we're now to down to one at a quarter for an entry\nAnd again we want people to participate we don't want to feel like it's an exclusive club\nRight yeah that's the idea so I'm Glad to see the change and I and I hope that reflects in a great audience for the upcoming any awards as well\nYou have the opportunity to bump into someone who is iconic here in Houston market bill by us a\nIs a a news anchor who has a really really done such a great job of sending through the ranks in is now a primetime anchor ah but you actually had the opportunity I guess in this past week to to hear him speak about as a media talk about that little bit of Joe\nWas a it was a great lunch and it's a media alliance has a lunch in once a month at the health club and it was um the luncheon was based on diversity and they had a folks there from um [noise]\n... ah I call it radio one it's a urban one now now with the their morning show a we had some Spanish station some Univision folks there as well as a media buyer from the parade and a bill by accident he\nBecame the keynote speaker or it was a roundtable discussion but he became the keynote\nIs view of the city since he's been on the air since Nineteen Seventy five and that changes the scene and diversity you know he talked about that when he was coming up on the ranks uh it was primarily a white male\nUm dominant\nThe on air personality that's what it was sure and the you know that that changed because the um [noise]\nPatients industry said you know you have your your on air personalities must near the look of the population but he he talked about some of the challenges in in that time period and the\nBiases or that people had but more importantly I think that that and I was told by numerous people that were at the lunch and that it was one of the best lunch and he talked about that the um [noise]\nDivide today in our country specifically that you have to mediums you have a liberal medium and a conservative medium or you know there's the CNN's or the world and then the box of the world and that he feels that it's really a is escalating how people\nAre are comfortable up or I Would say not comfortable um that that we are dividing our country because now you can you you don't have a choice of one network where you feel\nGetting the the true story although it didn't say that one or the other but there's there's a slant yeah and um he felt that that that is really bad for our country\nThat he called it the tipping point that he doesn't see us going back to the Walter Cronkite some of the world that we reached this this time period we're now we're gonna have to uh our\nPolitical views are going to be based on what what television or network we watch\nWow you know the probably might have existed even back in the seventies when he was there but to a lesser extent or but it certainly seems to me that the folks in in the television industry and the communication industry have responded to a well specifically Houston's diversity I mean look at what to\nLook at who we have on a year now a very good representation I think of a lot of folks and hopefully a truthful a representation without bias that's a tough thing to do though isn't it\nYeah uh you know I yeah obviously the uh the local news that they're not going to have as much bias because again it's local news\nNow and that's what he talked about up there was one interesting point they may do or they were talking about the what are the common languages in um\n[noise] the schools today\nAnd uh you know you would have thought okay English Spanish and um Mandarin and it was an English Spanish and Mandarin it was English Spanish and Arabic\nI'm a which tells you a lot about the diversity of of this\nUm of this city\nKnow there are sixty at least sixty countries represented in the city today so it is a extremely diversity and yes you're right you can see it in our anchors um when you look when you look at the local news\nNo guns into doing a good job we've got a great city here and and then as soon as I said uh it is one of the most diverse cities in the country I Believe we're ten years ahead of LA in that regard so this is a fun time to be in a in media and marketing and advertising isn't it\nIt is it is it's a it's definitely changes on a daily basis you know you you obviously you have the you\nKnow they also talked about the the change with a TV viewing where he built was talking about one of his sons in college debt he shows up at the dormitory\nActually it was one of the Spanish anchors was talking about shows up at the don't dormitory and he says where's your TV where's your stereo and he pointed to his smartphone [laughter]\nYep that's the way it's going folks and uh I think the broadcasters figure that out and do a good job responding move out as well yeah\nThe TV is no longer a I'm a television is the way we saw it is now an extension of our computer where we watch Netflix and Amazon and and Hulu and whatever so it's all stream not at all screaming but so much of it is is stream though\nAll bucks the convenience factor in the mobility factor and that's the way it is and it's a good thing I guess right\nSo let's let's wrap up with a just a commentary hears things are good things are looking really good for twenty nine team for abs and Houston and lots of things on the horizon so glad to have you or to to uh helping steer things and making things right for them to use them\nWell does it like they always say in the sports analogy is all about the team [noise] ride so on\nFriday November second twenty
