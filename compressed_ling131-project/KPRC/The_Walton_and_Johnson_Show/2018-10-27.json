{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "The catering stripper we have ... Petersen to bank for coming up with that but real quick though now that they caught this guy and he was a Trump supporter this is kind of sad for people like Elizabeth Warren or Sheila Jackson Lee who didn't get a fake bomb in the mail and that means that they're not going to be able to campaign off of this well\nIf only someone can help 'em out of high ranking member of the Democrats who has received a suspicious package in the mail\nI'm really important to them as a black lives matter what do they want to bomb me\nDo you say really outrageous things on cable TV news channels but you haven't been vulgar and offensive enough to be the recipient of a bomb threats\nThank God for that reason the only way I mean even like I said why isn't anyone why don't\nWe don't know who the Democratic party we know our constituents loved victims and receiving a suspicious package is a quick painless an easy way to look like a martyr I just want to win in November why can't someone sent me a suspicious package yeah but really truly noticed suspicious package to smoke on line to W. W. W. dot Democrats who need attention dot com\nAnd fill out our I Want to get a bomb threat for them to go to will send any antifa operative right over to your house office or summer home\nThey even had the thing the antifa well\nThat's nice that's really nice to them they're stepping up because of the great\nWondering if it's got a catering stripper it off or not it's going to represent him in the storm it in\n\nMy mind that was\nBrilliant I Wish that somebody put a warning on the screen that this was going to make me laugh I I have a habit of right when I go to a caller sometimes I'll take a sip of some soda water you know I'll let you guys talk talking drives up my mouth\nSo so I was just about to do that and then you said that I'm grateful I didn't er this microphone would be drenched right now take no no it's the spin to I'm ... I'm great it's it's been takes Martin do you uh do you think Michael I have an idea would take the deal\nI think he was what\nDo you think Michael have an idea would want to represent this guy I mean it'll be publicity but on the other ugly\nOn your town Stormy Daniels indicator stripper\nI mean it makes sense actually because think about the catering stripper separate let's read it if you think\nAbout it though this guy actually while it might seem unlikely for Michael I have an eighty to represent this guy actually if you pick out a little it does make sense because Michael having that he likes to represent people who make Republicans look bad and isn't it doesn't this guy make Republicans look bad\nAnd it broke right now a lot of trouble and you get back in front of CNN\nRight exactly yeah ever since Michael having any it turns out he's in debt millions of dollars he owes hundreds of thousands more to the IRS yeah Michael having any needs the catering stripper maybe we can make a connection Kmart and you want to go see less lonely boys most Lobos\nNot I'm not much into that but I tell you what you want to hear a quick joke I Would love to yes what's the difference between inlaws and outlaws what is that evidence outlaws or want it\n[laughter] I like my mother in law but I still like that joke hey speaking of jokes would you like to go to deport all the portrayals comedy tour\nOr not but I'm good I'm Out here in the middle of nowhere Martin nothing wrong with\nThat you know you ought to do go get some southern star beer from southern star Brewing Company a great place to hang out at up a condo thanks for the call Myrna appreciates which trip over here to Austin Austin is calling from Richmond Austin how are you sir\nI'm doing well thanks for taking my call time what's up\nNo first I just wanted to say on a kind of disrespected they didn't know how far ... boys\nBut that's what my defense in my defense back when they were both really popular a lotta people pointed out that's kinda weird they kinda sounded like and they have a similar name and aren't they both from Texas or is one of the west\nI mean it it it's a common mistake I'm Still upset about it though but regardless I wanted to see that Mickey\nAnd the comment that you're on the Facebook Live yesterday and the last thing she said before he got off the air was\nTalking about like a health\nCare and that they're calling it had you know there's also how birds you made any that there\nAre feeling that's been a lot of their rhetoric coming from the Democratic side than like well you know Americans don't want to do the jobs are the immigrants are feeling um which I think it's kind of the day\nYou know push for the dollar minimum wage thing right and it's kind of just it just backwards you know if you let capitalism work or you know you reduce the amount of population that's willing to work for low wages and now these people that are only learn to work for higher wages have leverage over them\nGreat point and and that's exactly true right so they're saying in one hand but they want higher wages\nAnd they're saying and the other hand that they want to raise the minimum wage is a federal minimum wage uh needs to be raised as Austin is just explain and in the other hand they're saying hey you people don't want these jobs\nLet's just give them the immigrants so the question is now what happens you raise the minimum wage you give the job doing immigrant now what happens to like a a a a trade worker skilled worker who was making Fifteen dollars an hour what happens to his pay now does he just quit and go become a cleaning lady 'cause it's slightly easier than welding something\nUh you know what's what's the point what's the incentive\nPeople on the left never understand this and really Austin what's remarkable about this is\nThe more advanced means we have in technology the more we don't need the minimum wage and here's what I mean by that we now live in the world I'm surrounded by computers I'm surrounded by one two three four five I have five I have no less than five computers six if you count my cell phone here in the room with me and I can operate them all the same time now imagine how many jobs\nCould essentially be done like data processing things like that that can be done with computing that maybe don't require a lot of your attention you just have to monitor a computer you could have a macro doing the data processing for you a centrally that\nThe minimum wage laws of screwed people out of taking advantage of a system like that you could take six or seven jobs at once if they all paid four dollars an hour and do six or seven jobs at once\nJust by using a bunch of computers but because of the minimum wage laws that will never be possible did I explain that clearly I've never I've talked about this before but\nAbsolutely I absolutely understand that and what's funny is like all the ... that left it you know they went to went to Denmark as an example of you know great socialism and stuff which is not free\nMarket economy right and they don't they don't have a minimum wage or sell\nIt though it's ... it's our capital of the lead backward yeah they they use the system out there that's not socialism you got that part right yeah it's it's something else\nAnd it's it's certainly is based on capitalism hey do you want to go to those lonely boys the most uh last Lobos\nI'd be happy to what you're going to Austin hang on for a second my producer will get on the phone with you hook you up with that Brian in Santa Fe how are you sir\nI'm to hurry are lonely needed somebody to talk\nTo you I Love when people call the show I like when we have full phone lines I could talk to people all day on the radio it's

FBI guys still got a lot that most of them have not been fired those ... would you call a rogue agents in the Obama group they're they're still in there nobody's been fired over any of this\nYou know they probably submitted everybody has like a you know we we all need we need five ideas from everybody by the end of the day all five good ideas and the idea box by the end of the day no ideas too ridiculous ... they might not even know who submitted it some guy just wrote why don't we uh threatened to blow up ourselves\nAnd say Trump's people did it at all we're doing this you know 'cause a homegrown lone wolf terrorists that's a big deal right now is er and it can be anybody out in any woods in any state where Trump won the election\nAny place where they allow the willy nilly parking of trailer homes is likely to be a location of the so\nCalled Trump nine people here's what I worry about\nThey're going to go to the extra step because Democrats are good and these FBI and CIA types they're thinkers they think the long game ... playing chess they're going to go out to the woods in some red state and they are going to find some guy\nWho lives out there by himself all alone and his dog ... Adam and they're gonna tip toe up in the middle of the night they probably already have and they're going to raise his big green plastic trash dumpster can\nOpen it up and they're going to throw a bunch of bomb making materials inside it cover it with some other tragedies of PVC however wires and say that it's not like that and then they're going to slip out undetected in the darkness of night\nAnd then about thirty six hours later they're going to get a tip go\nSee that all bought Archie out there in the woods he's been up just ... right before we give the nod to have the FBI\nGuys marsh from the bushes this storm is houses surrounding with that battering ram for the front door or the other thing we should do is have somebody sneaking mayor and the eleventh\nHour right before the raid probably a pretty darn ready to be best what are your sleep yeah and sprinkle a whole bunch of ... hats in an hour and materials and stuff all over the house there's\nYou know you have that and maybe I just for good measure a picture of a few of the intended victims of the pipe bomb with big Marshall I exercise on their face\n[laughter] see that's the kind of thing that I'm Talking about I could be a Democrat there is some moral rednecks\nUp and everything don't you managed to share except for the white parts which is going to give me give me a minute on that you know whether they get and they look like they're wearing a ... some white penny\nBut they're not yeah [laughter] oh look at old copper told look yeah ... ... for God\nYou know that was Jodie Foster copper tone the little\nGirl and the dog pulls the pan oh I was little butt cheek there yeah that old adage Jodie Foster and that they didn't look much blacker though well she was a little girl like your your change as time goes by\nI hadn't actually changed that much I still look like the same cute little kid I was when I was just a cute little kid metal chuckle head that with me\nYeah what people call you when you're a little a ... mile man used to call me chuckle\nHead hug my called me boy mostly by a boy get in there\nThat's pretty generic taxing it adds news boy ...

that was cliff bar she's a handful of their ... than a about four years later she married a failed her name a Fitzgerald\nAnd they got divorced six years later so uh where you got to ... to nominate

her to be or a companionship all the\nTime and what not going to happen 'cause she's one of these uh chicks is on the go and go her own stuff\nBut if you just wanted to hear that once or twice a

City at the time you see the one that dropped these by bombs I don't think he went down to the tribe banker grill the snow\nIs a ... year we ever going to find the truth because you know the NYPD Blue or handling all these bombs and uh\nSince their bosses are all hard core or left wing communist types and big Democrats will probably not ever likely to find out that not a single one of these bombs ever endangered anybody know of course not their their prop site movie props\nExcept for Hillary Clinton she was in danger or but good news Brian Williams is reporting this morning that Hillary Clinton diffused look bomb that was sent to her while taking sniper fire from a rabbit Trump supporter she's okay\nShe learned this when she was under heavy fire in Bosnia\nThat she's a she's got experience and it kind of thing so don't you worry about only ... out of a ah she's got like a bomb diffusing kid at the house not many people have that on hand but a Hillary does that's probably what was underneath the moon moves she was wearing that day when people thought she was on life support\nPeople thought she had square breathing device or move move and what it was was a a possibility of a chance to save the entire crowd should a bomb he\nPlanted I gotta say I do love the word ... a ... did you have relatives of what this was power at some point I guess it was the sixties fulfill isn't Walmart us we'll see some people still have\nTo I have relatives are women that that war movie they they weren't so huge they had to but it was the thing to do for about three days\nYou know a woman is on the verge of letting herself go ... who is too tight ... move on to it you could see that you can see the uh uh layers of fat and stuff through the ... type because it was supposed to be ... [laughter] you just kind of felt like a big grape\n... almost like a ghost outfit or something like that where they had hoped that\nThese checks and Walmart and they rode into the ...

[noise]\nYou know you can't get enough [noise] [noise] oh my God the Jewish walls in them jobs in\nThirty or seen going\nUs in just a moment inside a woman's hair and now it's time for another episode of one minute inside a woman's head\nI just bought a hundred and thirty dollars worth of makeup to get a thirty five dollar freak out\nI mean what a psychology I'm getting free stuff how I feel like it's okay to get a kind of crap I don't even need people they're ... they they know the sparkly trauma highs is less than special edition home mom I minored in\nFront of you and they say he's on the\nBoard to look at your holiday party and then all of a sudden I'm transported from October to December\nAnd I'm standing at [noise] God Knows who's house talking to random stranger wearing my fiancee make I\nAnd my life has changed because of that I've gotten a raise in a Christmas bonus and my boss has given me an extra week off for the holidays games because you can get put perch I should take it all back\nBecause I Am I I'm just going to need to keep the separate from my two hundred other products have under my thing\nAnd that was another episode of women one minute inside a woman's hair equal time must check the\nTime for another\nYears back inside a man's\nAlright to World Series is on tonight in hope that a noxious guy in the Marlins jerseys and bought a home plate or wouldn't miss him a bit I Will miss the lady behind home plate at the brewers games I like to watch her to keep score\nI guess a lot of non ...\nAlways been watching the Astros game see who was sitting right up there and him good seat behind home plate ... goal it's not just the play offs but especially the playoffs you saw back well and his wife oh\nMm [noise] yeah that was just he might just kick your ass he probably come up and give me a good group and I believe they handle yeah I like her good just for looking at is a lady I Know is retired and everything but I mean he still probably got enough to take you down back well ... and no one ...\n... are the three that you'd spot there it every game during the play offs and uh I'll tell you that and George Bush I'm assuming Nolan is aware and some of them adult diapers\nHe never got a [noise] now how does a [laughter]\nThem games go three and a half hour and all around which just sit there with that same ... look on his buddy you know I feel there's a long walk to the bathroom there and use a net\nAnd live the TV cameras that he probably didn't even think about being on him didn't care uh but yeah it got hurt to get up and down and walk them steps and go back there just to and you know an old man like get to go ... go now no one could have been in\nA suite with a private bathroom would have been ... a guy like no one wants to be buying that play where you can see the pitch you didn't nobody talked too much either he wants to see those pictures you see what many young if he's got this stuff today are\nThinking about disasters games reminds me of when Barbara Bush was a lie\nIf you'd see that big massive shining glowing gray hairs sitting back there like I Am the giants of cotton candy could not miss mar when ah when her and George would go to those games\nAnd that reminds me of a like you were talking about or they're gone on to the reward old men and their dads\nAnd my old man had season tickets the Astros for years decades and he never\nGot to see a World Series polio no even a World Series appearance but I think the percentage are\nPeople that had season tickets versus the oh my God the uh the big win\nLast year the first game I went to ... dad in his season tickets now he was in the insurance game so I tend to other seat\nWe'll have to go I learned later\nProbably shows girlfriend but let's head customer customer rage that I've taken a much dimmer or to the game legitimately clients did go to the game I think the girlfriend went to a few too but I never had to go sit on her lap or anything that would have been an uncle aunt Suzy [laughter]\nI did have that we're just one time I had to wait in the car where we had to swing by aunt Suzy ... not long did you have to weigh one law guy but he didn't want to know it wasn't an abusive thing I could you went in there and had some butter whatever he just forgot something there and he had to go pick it up a ... he was out like in five minutes\nI forgot I left my original over there I'm going to go get it why would you leave something apartment complex your life is is all about [laughter] but\nAnyway um the very first game I saw was a a cult forty fives game season tickets even when they were the ... forty fives or not and that became an astro thing and then later and asked her thing and they always had the good seats sorted out behind home plate back there where you can see the pictures and the\nIdea of what you're safe back there I see those your very safe so so foul balls go rocketing right over the de dum de ... the high you'd never going to get a foul ball I Know you need to take your glove and this man up and say hit me with a political pepper on it\nThey're never going to score a ball because they've got that net up there on top the only time I ever got a ball\nBecause what I Want to but they were you in the conference well when I was a dead ... they didn't have Crawford seat back in those days was we're talking Astrodome\nDays at this point astronaut even pre Astrodome when they put up a temporary stadium out there on the planes will be asked to go where the Astrodome was being built field of them they will come they put up a temporary little stadium was kind of rickety\nCycling this crowd was start stopping their feet oh God I Wish they stop you folks everybody's still me still this thing's going to come down stop is\nBut uh I Do catch a ball one time because I went with my little league team and we weren't behind the ... we were in the outfield that's where the kids are supposed to be and all of playing the Chicago Cubs and Ernie Banks at a home run and I got the ball\nNow you're not supposed to keep the other team ball when they hit a home run less ... famous\nWhich he was famous he was going to find so I went down and to the dugout and got the Ernie Banks to sign it and I don't know\nWhere the hell that ball is probably worth something\nNot acting they're gay I went down and got him so I think we may end up\nPlaying pitch with it at some time ago probably took it out in the yard are so stupid we do to do things like that\nIt's like I had a football signed by Earl Campbell\nAfter an oil or game and we played football in the front yard with that thing it was so stupid you got to do is put that away somewhere got Earl Campbell signed it after a big game right there the front yard skin ended up on the sidewalk and whatnot 'cause we're corn on the freeway mad or kids who didn't have a budget do to throw around\nI got me one em Oilers helmets that are all Campbell autographed yeah no for many helmet no no I mean like I was in a ... helmet face masks yeah I Know for a fact\nThat a real number ward and again you just autographed it it was all the equipment right because I tried to put my head and saying I'm going to put my head and there were Earl Campbell head was I couldn't get that thing to my\nEar is probably the reason he was able to get it for nothing it was like I didn't see anybody had\nIt was the small nobody nobody wants to the small now the small beautiful anyway it it's still there you know that's our history I always\nFelt bad 'cause you'll man never saw the Astros doing never saw the Oilers do anything you know never will he was there to the love your blue days when you know kicked the door down knock the door down or whatever that ever happened nope\nNever had it was fun time oh good lord I big party they had when I came back from Pittsburgh and everybody filled up to do and you know any\nMinute the taxes are heading for the super same thing same thing yeah many if any minute now would you\nTo Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office all of them in a row you move at one of the idiots on the news last night came on and told us she is not suspected of sending the bombs or\nIs she clever enough to think that this wouldn't keep me from suspecting her\nOne can only we do know they were sent by a Democrat to make the conservatives Trump people look\nBad well this was to dominate the news cycle take the news coverage off the caravan\nTake it off the fact that uh\nThat I hadn't heard about the ... and this morning a blue wave is not\nGoing to happen so instead we can be talking about Trump supporters and Trump supporters this is the kind of thing we come to expect\nFrom supposedly Hillary said we can't be civil to them because they are so hateful yes the silver re fill of hate and rage\nNow\nUnlike the ... situation nobody's been hurt here\nIf this was a Trump supporter sending these things out some people would have got blowed up buddy absolutely let me tell you borrow\nBack that's what another thing that tells us it's fake yeah because the Steve ... got shot and some other people got shot in that particular situation and the guy wanted to shoot 'em all and if I had to buy the Capitol police there he was shot them all yeah\nSo don't give us this nonsense about welding and this is the Trump supporters they are just a you know you're going to hear Nancy Pelosi gathering about this to these these these people\nThey're just you know I hate it hate us so and then you know get that shall we hands all we have left to do is just to a bundle\nTogether and and [laughter]\nAnd hot and rebel and our democratic ... know all we have left to do is remove Trump from off at the end of the only way to stop this from happening in the future I met right after ... removed from office there yes\nNow we didn't warn people that you should probably if you're a Trump supporter and your unknown magazine ... wherever\nYou probably should check your your trash or you know underneath your house or wherever they can hide some evidence that could be planted on you to make it look like you're the bomber
