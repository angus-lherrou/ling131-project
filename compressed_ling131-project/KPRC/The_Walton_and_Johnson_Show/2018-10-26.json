Internet name and they had a\nBad posted a picture of one of the Bob's who was a bomb and went to Biden's house and they had a picture of it in X ray of it and they put it up on the Internet shut since winded\nFederal investigations of something as serious as bombings post their\nEvidence on line for the regular people to see unless it hey look you eat that looks like a real bomb right there is the publicity stunt sure he said if it was a real bombing it wouldn't be posted pictures of the Bob on the Internet so people could look at it\nWhy would they do that because it's it's a some kind of mass grow but ah what do you call it a false flag I'm ringing probably done by government agents like some of these ... types that are just trying to be heroes and save us from ourselves\nThat our stupidity they could've made it a much better looking bomb that they could have made it probably explode but they didn't I'm probably sure they went over\nWhat they should do\nHow good the bomb should be because they could probably make a really good sure let's see if we make them to good people believed it from an amateurish and our a deplorable hiding out there in the shack somewhere on may ...

public arrest of it make sure he keeps his mouth shut and does it get to talk to any pressuring each day\nAnd there you got it case closed now after the election we find out it was phony and Democrats did disturb cells\nIt's too late this kind of like when Harry Reid said\nJak chime that he knew he was lying but hey we won the election day anyway that's all that matters they came out when he came out said Donald Trump pay no taxes or no it was Mitt Romney was Mitt Romney pay zero taxes\nOn the already is yet they've already that just the ... the media\nWas here today to negotiate whether she gets big paycheck or not to leave town just go away\nHow much of a payoff will see except to walk away because look NBC's been looking to do this and they made the mistake of signing it that it was a huge mistake they've never had any kind of rating success whether she's not worth the huge money they pay for her\nAnd to to save face they had to wait for a mistake wait wait for it she'll make one of these racist PC some kind of mistake that we can nail or ... and that's all well hangar out to dry with and they waited and waited and this is what they went where\nThey throw up and knock you out it was likely to be some kind of a Asia ... or ... you know pulling their eyes back to the side of her head making a a\nAn Asian pays going hall I'd be doing that things you know ... uh she didn't she didn't do that she didn't go fall for that it was a pretty innocuous\nStatement about well\nI don't see anything wrong with it if it's for like Halloween and felt like oh\nMy God she doesn't see this is your lawyer\nShe's got to be put into the chamber of death and tortured and just she she\nComes up so they're firing here and like I say this is just the excuse of the\nDay they needed one they look for one they waited for one here comes and they had to wait a decent amount of time if they had a fight or ride away with it and we made a mistake from day one on this they know they did oh yeah right away they start moving around as soon as they got her\nTo a different time slots trying to see if people would follow or to those time slots and what happened is every time slot they moved to to get worse and the\nType of shows that are doing that they couldn't make up their mind ... was she going to be a news person plus you're going to be a highly entertainer celebrity yeah and when she had Jane\nFonda on and that didn't go well I'm going to be the white Oprah she get out of that interview with celebrity is she going to be the new Barbara Walters she'll do those cutting in depth interviews\nNo none of that she was just the news chick straightened it has to go ahead of any kind of attractive that was hurt and kind of had a different look to you and it it kind of work for Fox so they gave it a huge ...\nWord was at Fox put out a deal\nWorth a hundred million dollars over time to get her to stay and not leave she chose to take the great adventure of head north to NBC or she felt she'd be more [noise]\nLegitimate so to speak not on that strange Fox Network and a Fox yesterday because of media depressed Miranda hurts at ... you know here's your chance you want her back it

actors in lots of movies but watch because of the popularity then why pd blue he could never be that character actor ... nobody's going to go every time\nThey say what's he doing why simple it's on this movie so yesterday and I had a list of the highest paid TV\nAct toward from Forbes which makes the lists and now today's highest pay TV actress says now remember in this new world of America where ah we're supposed to be going\nSocialism communism and we're not supposed to what's really get this money making business all these people on this list here all want to be a socialist they all want to celebrate the beautiful new socialist America with how much money so the cholera heads the list for Modern Family at forty two and a half\nMillion dollars over the last one year\nOur Sophia why don't you give up for you but keep a couple of million for yourself a gift forties is poor and more Fallujah that\nKaylee to go from the big bang theory a distant second is only twenty four and a

them the wrong with capitalism it's got to go you can have too much money\nYeah not if you want to get on board with live they never set the stage and of course all the Democrats want to raise your taxes\nAre not a single one of them ever willingly pay as a matter of fact there's a bunch of them still owe the Irish money they haven't paid that's right they're behind but not but you'd think they'd want to just volunteer that money because they're so concerned about the money going into the government\n[noise] yeah it's almost like they're disingenuous are phoney all ... all over\nAgain

Glad to know that somebody is that they're finally doing something ... instead of just making fun of and said Matt Damon on fat and reacting somebody is doing the right thing you got an email here today sin\nAlyssa Milano is teaming up with that arrow chick\nI tell you that listen my wife she is singing my two in here lately and she's got going on she's just a writing the hand is what she is in the street think are out there with management written all over I mean that beating on the Supreme Court door house and stuff\nIt just gets better every day now I'm not sure who the arrow she is a good be Jennifer Lawrence because she was a bow and arrow girl in those movies I don't watch the arrows so the arrow who is a TV show good\nSome other chick but you know you know who Jennifer Lawrence is yeah you think she was all that I don't know why or she was ... she left right so let's say say maybe it's it's her Jennifer and Alissa mulatto are teaming up\nNow I can see that they are working to have\nA a ban placed on sending mail bombs wow they think that\nWould probably be a fix this problem in a hurry isn't it already illegal to send a male oh you did not just I mean just a tonic it out loud to spoiler on that story sure we already have that law and affects\nA says the same thing about that sounds familiar illegal to mail of farm let me get back but I think I'll\nBet if I go look up our laws are men we already have one about illegal to mail bombs in the mail but you know bomber name comes up and my thoughts yeah yeah yeah I think maybe the maybe right after\nThat we died at ... and we decided that'd be a bad idea but are less than\nA hearing here just it just hit them ha ha ha good for you maybe we should make a law yeah sure\nMaybe you two should just make love and let the rest of us watch but hey my guess is that where you're taking this now Baltimore elementary school Baltimore County elementary school or a certain one stop to play thank God you're getting in front of this for our kids get hurt\nOr because of complaints yeah you know how they put on a plate at the Old West to home elementary school\nThey had a player the kids were going to put on a a lead for all the youngsters so students audition for the play and it was all set to go\nAnd then uh somebody up in the hierarchy said well\nThat's stereotyping of Arab culture\nNot when Disney does it but when they do it at the school play it is what gives us not cartoon characters is actual kid's acting this sounds yeah in the play Arabs are described as barbaric and those are exact words that are used and the actual play has a controversial\nUh apparently in the in the nineties ... mask says her son decided to drop out of the play\nBecause um she's an attorney for the council on American Islamic Relations or an enemy organization now is embedded in our nation trying to bring us down so the school after pressure from several\nWell actually one near a yeah it's just one complaint so fifty\nKids learn all their songs in lines of all step down our cars that one person networks for care complain [laughter]\nThat's a great show\nWe apologize but the drama club and west town elementary school has\nDecided Disney's Aladdin junior is too offensive to the a rep people in the audience and we decided to cancel the rest of their production as an alternative leaves enjoy this publicly funded depiction of of very elegy beat CQ Ramadan thank you\nAnd now the results of the mega millions jak\nNot you\nKnow that's it for the results junkie response [laughter]\nThe gas or like last time\nNot you like I told you before I'm very suspicious we have the one point six million ... million dollar where in North Carolina or South Carolina was out and but we don't know who they are and I\nNever will because South Carolina has a no law stating that they have to come forward while they don't even have to pick up their prize we've been informed by the Carolina I think if you had one point six billion dollar ... you'd probably go get it they said\nThey could wait up to Ninety Days yeah they can by the time they get get their financial order he won one point six billion dollars to put down there right now you would have been there in a tent when they open up the door in the morning waiting I would've\nRed lights and ... just broken every speed limit law there was to get there not until the cop a fine to me and I'll pay I got I've been waiting on me heroin followed are hired\nA helicopter to lead me on the law that was the last replace billionaire and I can do that because the I'm just not used to that kind of big money like the way you're thinking maybe there\nKnocking banging on the door first thing in the morning but now you know ... up to Ninety Days to picture that\nMakes me believe it's phony nationally there is no winner or what ever happened to that winter from a two three months ago\nUh yeah they came for that we're not allowed to tell you who are funds are that ah I have available to\nMe I just really smells to high heaven unless I win it soon I'm going to have to think the whole damn thing has read bank yep yeah unless they make me a winter it's fake absolutely and I'm Upset by that\nSo I'm going to get a uh Powerball chance tonight for a year to give it a gym is like five hundred and ... million is not quite like one point six
