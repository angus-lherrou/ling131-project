out and first of all it's not really a battle of the other side agrees on the bed and maybe offer something in return if they lose the ... by the by the no this was just more of a a you know a promise I guess she did not acknowledge here's what he said though he specifically said that if she won the Democratic nomination\nAnd they were in a debate but then he would generally toss the ancestry tests to her\nIt wouldn't just be one that she went out and have done on her own right he would throw were like the DNA test in a box she knows that that came back that she was Native American he would give a million dollars to her favorite charity she knows that\nShe just play and the fact that most people sort of cause I hear things and then he goes back she goes back and plays on that said he said he pay a million dollars here I Am a big oh Indian and worst nightmare you know it's like you're one thousand sixty fourth\nIn India that is even true at all and it's quite questionable but it's still funny to use the term but as Susan wrote and yet we did here they did not compare her DNA to actual Native American DNA because they didn't have any fear\nThey use the DNA from a Peruvian and Honduran otherwise natives we wouldn't have been hard to get Cherokee DNA they didn't bother getting any it could have been real easy in other words they didn't get it because they knew it wouldn't matter no reason they didn't get it\nIt's just a you know there is not a lie\nToo big for a Democrat to just stop and does it no I Can't say that in public for example this a fat guy that cut up in Saudi Arabia\nAnd everybody's all up in arms that could be one of the\nBiggest ... and actually can be one of the ... it could start a war it could be one of the biggest crisis in the world is going up the journalist journalist uh already he he kinda got all the upside of the the prince he didn't like him already CNN MSNBC ABC all the powers that be and the fake news media\nHave all got Trump being the reason this guy was cut up now listen to some of the reasoning\nWe've got a president that has already name journalists as being the enemy of the people said don't be surprised and other countries take on a journalist murderer chopping pieces and dispose\nDonald Trump it was always been critical of the Washington Post always been critical of his ownership did anybody in the administration in Jared Kushner didn't they give a\nSort of a nod in a way to say it's okay and the\nPresident say syringe I'm off the show he is a um as a reporter he's a columnist rarely a at a at a critical of uh the Saudi Government that stands in contrast with a message that the president has frequently sent to the American people and to his supporters that the media are the enemy of the people how do you square those two I Wonder\nIf you look at what's happened the last hundred days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric not just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with anything at all\nI Can't compare that to you say because this is the president's attacks on journalists because of an accurate and fake news report it that's kind of the same excuse the Iranians use the ... the Turks used the Chinese used and the Saudi she's right there issue is that these people who we think of as journalists reporting inaccurate and fake news about those governments you can see the connection I make it\nRight you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nI remember vividly at train trip up I mean when I talked to a group for international and and ask them to protect journalists who told me it was within my top political office they thought the worldwide threat journalists\nShowing up and this is kind of the room what is happening now in terms of human right not only to try and several hot hot around the world\nAnd let's face it we have a president who say they're also the [noise] so uh values like freedom of speech and defense\nSuddenly are very around the world\nYeah these are the people that don't allow any just said well uh you'd you'd be shocked at how little the people with those opinions and want to know what your opinion is\nOh we

Seventeen\nSeventy Seventeen sixty seven\nYeah we ain't even become a free country yet Charlie what's your dog about free oh God oh you're going to have that argument now and we weren't free and just say country\nAnyway uh most of us are Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon completed the survey\nThey were hired to do between the boundaries of the ... of Pennsylvania and\nMarilyn in areas that would eventually become the state to Delaware in West Virginia apparently there had been like even like today there have been violence at\nThe borders between these uh because of a dispute as to where the border was\nSo they hire these cats professional survey years to come in and doing officials survey\nBy the way paid for by his majesty King George and the crown Logan England\nThe Mason Dixon Line is it that far north as the southern border so vain and today because of\n... when it broke out in the civil war Maryland broke on the side of the confederacy Pennsylvania state and the union well it has to if they do that line and so to this day that line is used when they're speaking of the north in the south although today you'd be hard pressed to represent to a recognize\nMaryland as I said well you saw what happened in Maryland they didn't have a you know have the government feet there than it's all been in Israel or yes it's all been engulfed by Washington DC\nBut when you look at the line drawn on a map there's not much\nOf the north no above it I mean you've got a Ohio and Pennsylvania and obviously New York and New Jersey and on into the northeast but the south is a bunch geographically a much larger swath one hundred years\nAfter Mason Dixon began their effort to chart the boundaries soldiers from opposite sides blood stained the fields of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania or\nBy the way they took that line west that get drawn at north of Kentucky border Kentucky and then the drug it across Arkansas they read at the southern border there Missouri\nAnd then they just kind of skimmed through the northern part of Oklahoma ... way north Oklahoma is now above the Mason Dixon Line but it slides right across the top of the pan handle just north of ...\nIt just it it it uses the northern panhandle border and then drop straight down the side of Texas and cuts left all the way over to El Paso\nWhich means they do wrong is not from the south not\nTechnically no El Paso is right on the ... down the line he's outside it's in the line\nAnd that makes me want to strike up the ban one more time [laughter]\nWe're looking at a noble civil war in the country do probably

the elbow thing\n... you know if you did that with a sheet over your head I do know it was you know what you're doing that would have ... it was on this\nDay and I have an Eighteen sixty seven his personal that the United states formerly took the keys and moved in to the newly purchased state of Alaska about that at one stage I may have with the territory they didn't\nKnow much about Alaska and then they were really excited when they saw that that's right yeah I Am mountain up there the guy who\nBought it who was in charge of making the purchase of the time working for President Johnson just anniversaries or isn't it yeah William Henry Seward and they called it ... because it was just a stupid purchase\n... really know that this is this a real estate agent for you they sold those Alaska in the summer is implying oh yeah we bought it now and in about\nThree weeks said this is that we're ... we're not allowed to do it 'cause I like this whether it be nice for about six days are these bears everywhere oh yeah good mood still get the moves they're friendly though you're at the time they did not know about\nSo seven point two million dollars comes out to less than two cents an acre for the deal not that has a pretty good deal not bad at but everybody said man what are you going to get out of Alaska and then of course shortly\nThereafter they discovered gold Seward didn't have a folly anymore it's like hey\nI've always said I Love this guy Stewart got an eye for property\nAnd believe you know when when they first found out about a yellow stone\nThere you know in Wyoming and all that area there they are a guy I forget the guy's name now that that found it and they called it his Bali yeah because they thought last just stinky\nIt's got a bunch of gas assay and then lastly water you'd never which costs a lot of smells real bad by and and then the mountain men found out they could winter there and stay warm all year and take ... and everything\nAt the time or Mr Johnson who was the president President Johnson\nWas having some trouble with his image because he had a little thing con gone after the civil war called the the reconstruction which meant\nThe complete annihilation foot on the destruction of the south that was going on them carpet baggage has come in and it it was not good PR it was a strain on his presidency he said you know or we need something distract everybody what if we bought a big new piece of property everybody'd be talking about that right\nAnd it kind of work that kind of pulled the attention away from is reconstruction and everybody started talking about this idiot a Seward who bought this dumb ass property\nWrong by the way speaking of ruining television shows like they do like they were going to do with Roseanne there gotta bring stuff back\nYes what they're bringing back\nGod I care what they're going to ruin it was Mr Ed\nNYPD Blue one day and they bring in ... by word of God they're even going to have a new simple words\nHold off on the phone yeah okay then you replace them no no this is somebody's going to have to do something I'll have to do something if nobody else does and they apparently the deals already been made a who's a botched go\nI guess it was only a botched cos gone you know hadn't had any money in a while [laughter] and the cop shows a mind on puzzle or though they said they're going to call it a pretty cool it's about the son of Andy simple with trying to earn his detective badge\nAnd solve his father's murder which can do anything about civil with being killed\nBecause they didn't in the series wait wait wait no\nHis son got killed yes simple would son was a policeman and got killed how can the show about Yankee you Andy uh was it and yeah and yeah\nAnd ship was didn't get killed at the end of what he had two sons well ah so it might be the little one about the ... it might be CEO is going to solve dads murder\nOh so yeah oh\nThat means that chick that was his mother could be there as a grandma type figure now ... ...\n... [laughter] nope feels mother was killed ... that's right that's right because they launch it came to take over he was raised by a\nSimple words his ex wife for some reason yeah I think it was Katie

lord you smell like cookies and stuff like that who is coming back\nIn and this means ... got killed\nYeah we never heard about that so this is a really dumb idea that's probably going to bomb to buy your think Dennis Franz is a and then all the way in ... seen him lately I have not [laughter]\nI mean he's very old obviously yes no he's not he didn't look that great you know I don't think he's ready to for a comeback not like in ... he'll come back in flashbacks for Theo and stuff and I think he could do flash or maybe they'll show the murder they might have a ... a bunch of all the\nStuff they cut out of the old show they can piece together for a flash back to I don't know\nI still think it's a prequel ... before the show Andy simple words are younger not his son that will have to be a postal ... post ... ... a pretty cool [laughter] I don't think he's TV anything I Want to learn\nThat we're surrounded by idiots here we are oh sorry we could have predicted that\n[noise] we're
