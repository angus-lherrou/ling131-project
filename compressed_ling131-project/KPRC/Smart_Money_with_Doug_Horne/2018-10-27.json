I got took out a piece of paper in a pen and he lost our ladies and gentlemen wrote letters\nA piece of paper like the kind of stuff a Mark Twain used to do and I took three or four days to cook you know the regular\nOld snail mail there is a this is from by the way from a ...\nMe and palm hand I'm assuming probably brothers couldn't be\n... you know father and son those handy boys\nThe hand they're a handful of them had ... watch out more from Daphne\nAlabama now you know we're not on the radio and Daphne, Alabama oh these boys is working hard to get their show I bet they're going to disagree with us about that are targeting call and good well it might be Auburn fans I hate Alabama true much or more than ... true although Auburn what uh\nI I don't want to tell you bring up what a bad season or ...\nTimes I've just but I Love 'em anyway you know you love your team at all let her win or lose your level I don't know the last few games says a while to not this year is the only settled science I Believe in the wall to Johnson show me and my brother love your show listen daily and we use the app all the time\nTill producer Kenny we enjoy his show also you know he's on the Houston station ... if the issue of happening in the afternoon\nAnd thank you so much for the best day of mourning show on a planet you are truly her do radio drawl\nOr give you both human and Tom I bet they've had some fights over the last one them hand boys three now\nThat'll get busy day what\nThen that's going to a bar in up ...\nThey they tell sold so hard they clean most of the floor of the barn up\nAnd I tell you I clean up a bar and it's still a job I Do not enjoy I wouldn't think so I'd never claimed one ever can I see it on television it like a big house a horse pool I like having Costner clean about well about a little stall in a barn on yellow stone a few months\nAgo yeah he had a pitch for dinner and now I get what the pitch for his phone and never really know why they had the little food for well it's so that the ah hey I guess the either the puck drops out and I have days on or the the drop that I'm not sure how it works\nThat hey drops out number you maintain that it's kind of like a shift in for a goal\nIs to separate or is all what do you separate now hey prone to poop\nBall a lot of times in these horse stalls you've got a witch called chip would\nYou've got a seat or ... yeah I think there's a ... year or the odor and the whole well here in Boston you want you want to leave the chips behind because they're kind of expensive and you don't want to throw away all your tips with the poop\nSo a lot of times you can sift through that and keep a lot of the euro wood chips and throw away Europe I saw Kevin Costner do it and I feel privileged well what's that old boy's name a\nSasha crash or whatever his name is ... ... oh yeah all of this\nDirty work as a good idea yeah you don't have to do that I Know I Know we don't have to like to do it like to do with it I Choose to do it\nSometimes there are certain people in this world that need menial tasks inform against their brain a chance to drift off and think about other things doing chores that don't require a lot of thought\nThat's how he would think would head of the labor and that kind of thing 'cause mine off into the missing coal ugly it lets you think so I well I recommend it I did find it hard to believe that he was out there riding Brock\nAfter ... that's probably a little bit of a stretch what with the stitches are still\nIn his belly yeah that was All right that the bucking horse I've known plenty of rough tough cowboys and grew up poor and no not which you're not and I had a horse STD heart is what exactly\n[laughter] although I Will say this is a cat and Kevin Costner is made for that role quite good at it now here's what I Wonder if they ... it is going to come back and writer if they're going to go ahead and kill off Kevin Costner because\nHe's too expensive to keep on the show and they got they used in beginning started and then they'll keep all of the other characters in just have\nHim be dad that used to be there\nFrom what I read about season to that that was the original plan but it got more popular than they even expected and I think they plan to get a little leaving him around for a little while maybe so yeah so that'd be fine with\nMe I Am curious as to what the guy's name is now yeah I Can't uh he had a cool name like zipper rep for rent boiler yeah\nAnd you ... you'd never guess who that was because you've seen him and other things but he looks completely different in that role that's coal Hauser\nAnd if you saw him out of character is it oh well I Know that guy and I had no idea it with him so he's doing what's known as ... or ...\nOften a while he plays a good man because he's just understated enough like a real bad asked\nWould be this kind of like he doesn't go around bragging about what a bad after years it just takes care of bad ass business [laughter] and\nThey always have by the way if you're if you're going to work for Kevin Costner first of all don't let them\n... ... ... and you don't want that brand you never get out of that second of all if they mention anything about taking the train station rug\nAbout politics one way or the other which they are really shouldn't because I'm\nGiven a crap right now doesn't seem to help much didn't seem to matter\nWhat I Want you to understand is that the Trump supporters already get\nDissed last night ... another a big Trump rally this time in Wisconsin I don't\nThink it was anywhere near as big it's used in a powerful stuff it hot elation bass said as little as ... I I was nicer Wisconsin they meant well they came out early they stood in line waiting patiently for Trump the news came out\nAbout the alleged pipe bombs like six inches worth of PVC pipe and the little ... powder probably is actually probably dirt or something\nAnyway the news came out to the crowd in Wisconsin or the pipe bombs had been sent out do a bunch a Democrat type ... the crowd immediately started chanting lock her up lock her\nUp and they knew who would who just told people to go out and be on civil well as\nI Know you people more you want to get on top of Hillary in a bad\nMouth full careful I Want to defend Hillary and this one I'm pretty sure before but this was a was a little smarter than Hillary this was like one of the new opera I think that's one of the deep state people from inside\nProbably one of the ... FBI guy ... you know got a lot that most of them have not been fired those ... ... what do you call a rogue agent said they were they ... the Obama group there are there still isn't there nobody's been fired over any of this\nYou know they probably submitted everybody has like a you know we we all need we need five ideas from everybody by the end of the day all five good ideas and the idea box by the end of the day no ideas too ridiculous ... they might not even know who submitted it some guy just wrote why don't we uh threatened to blow up ourselves\nThose and say Trump's people did it at all we're doing this you know as a homegrown lone wolf terrorists that's a big deal right now is er and it can be anybody out in any woods in any state where Trump won the election\nAny place where they allow the willy nilly parking of trailer homes is likely to be a location of these so\nCalled Trump now people here's what I worry about\nThey're going to go to the extra step go Democrats are good and these FBI and CIA types they're thinkers they think the long game rise they're playing chess they're going to go out to the woods in some red state and they are going to find some guy\nWho lives out there by himself all alone in his dog ...
