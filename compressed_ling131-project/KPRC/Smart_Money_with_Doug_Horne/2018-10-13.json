[laughter] ah what we call a ministry now trying to help ... a senior citizens and their economic situations and and uh\nUh sure it's a business but you know it it it's fun to help people\nUh that need help and anything whether it's financial whatever food or whatever and and I know that can help a lot of people out there that need it and maybe you're not the poorest maybe not the rich or should I can help all kinds of people so if you have a mortgage on your home\nAnd you have enough equity and you're sixty two are older and your spouse if you're married is sixty tour older\nThere's no reason for you not to call me called eight five five to six six sixteen hundred eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nI can help you if you have enough equity in your home is that's based on what to ... pounds worth and how much you know\nAnd then what's your age is and that tells me how much reverse mortgage that can do in many cases not only do I pay it off and keep those darn payments and make them go away every month for you but I can give you cash in addition\nSo let's say you qualify for two hundred thousand dollar reverse mortgages neo fifty thousand on your home we pay off the Fifteen give you a hundred and fifty\nSo I mean it it's their folks your average putting it out there for you so why not check into it or at least in choir I mean don't listen to these people say oh it's a bad thing don't call thing I mean that makes sense to me uh\nI gave me example uh\nBut I tell people that said if somebody said re a you've got three thousand dollar payment but I can make it go away and your payments got to be zero for life\nNow you know how fast I can say I'll take the zero I mean he wouldn't get that last run out of his mouth for say ... I'd say give me that zero\nAnd uh it makes sense it's just like if somebody said right Eileen do a million dollars or a billion dollars and you don't have to make any payments until after you die\nOr the house then it gets paid off I mean given tend to give me the million or billion ... it it's it's a\nIt's a no brainer folks but can't help you unless you make that phone call 'cause I got to meet you got to talk to you on the phone that if you want to make will meet everything's free the phone calls frame I visit to use for your visit to me is free\nWhenever you want to do I am here to help you but you need to make that first phone call a five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOkay the next question as if I if I did give your money what can you do with the money and the answers whatever you want you're not limited to what you can do you can pay off bills always pay officers charged cards first and then maybe your car and\nThat you don't have any bills that's great just put it in savings account like my wife and I did in or near six point two percent tax free and I'd say it's actually not taxed for interest on your money so let it grow\nYou know you put a hundred thousand and let grow grow grow when you need it or take it all out if you want or just to have sent me a couple of thousand a month you know it's your money you can do whatever you like with it\nI Wonder if I Want to purchase a home and that's what my wife and I did we purchased a home and in Haiti and love it it's a smaller a it's a one story in smaller pool and uh we love it we just made a down payment and nope Amos forever\nAnd ... and when I say forever I mean eternity because we're going to have and you can't do this but Jesus in your heart and and love him to death and he'll be right back\nA on a purchase ... still invest a a ... into the growth ladder the first line of credit [noise] uh yes it's it's what I my wife and I called in savings that's why we as much as I said it's a lot of credit grow fun but it's a it's our savings account so I always refer to it as\nAnd yes chicken ... even if your purse has she can take your other friends that to be from the house and put into the line of credit up to the amount of oil\nOr do I need a lot of money to qualify no you know because there's no payment\nThen it's easier to qualify when you have a zero payment that if you are going to have less say a thousand dollar monthly payment on a traditional though\nAre the next one will spend a little time with before the day is over and it's one of my house is clear\nYou know it's nice to have a clear house in the clear car and reaches nice because you don't make monthly payments but you know have it\nSo you can go down to show people your neighbors all that you got to clean a clear title to your home and your car you do it because you don't make a payment so if you could not make a payment and get fifty thousand a hundred thousand two hundred thousand or more\nA wouldn't that make it a better deal than just having a clear answers your house is expensive\nYou're paying property taxes you're paying home church or playing home association does you're doing repairs on your house you're painting that you're maybe you have put a roof sometimes our air conditioner brags there's always something to do in the house so it's it's it cost you money so that has been sent you a check\nBut I can if you have enough ah um if you're old enough and we take a certain portion of the equity with around you that they need to what you want more than ... bills\nOr you put it in that savings account for your for your retirement you do anything because it's your money just after you what you do with it\nBut I'd love for you to call me I I I just want to have as many folks as I can the phone number is eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred all you have to do is call and ask questions and Inquirer then you say well I just don't understand it enough can we may not so sure when you go out of the year ... you can come to my home\nAh there's no see there's no charge there's absolutely no charge a\nAnd uh but I you know it starts with you like it most things in life start with us too if you want to make a difference in your life and never send your economic situation it starts with you\nKnow when you're sixty to an older you don't want to start investing in real estate or risky bonds you know when you want to do something solid safe and I'm I'm Talking about something the governor is fixed for you that is solid safe it a hundred percent insured by the government\nSo my wife and I was retirement that were put in there you know the money where he is a far retirement that we put in that savings account earning about seven percent [noise] ah it's it's a hundred percent insurance I say for us so we feel comfortable that that money is going to be available to us for as long as we live\nAnd uh that's why we we could tell them you know to send a thousand two thousand three thousand four thousand whatever we want we just figure out how much money and how long it'll\nSummer with along with the leader in the government censors [noise] so anyway they might just kind of ...\nBut as long as you're on the program but I went to the nose you have to be sixty two years are over and you do have time to forever zero pilots for life if you have a mortgage on your home or homeless clear that's fine thank you so much for less than I Love you and God Bless you
