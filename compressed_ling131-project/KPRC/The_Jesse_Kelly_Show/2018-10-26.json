{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Important to cross when you're trying to hold a lead major beginning to solidify as the as the election gets closer and I think what's\nWhat's most interesting about the numbers we got in that race is if you drill down into the internal so little bit you know this race has shaped up to look a lot like we expected it would were not we've been saying for for months going into this race that this was likely to be a a contest that mobilization rather than persuasion that each campaign would\nBe trying to get as many of their voters out as they could and not be spending too much time trying to change\nThe minds of a part as soon as trying to get Republicans to vote democratic or Democrats to vote Republican yeah so you know Ninety Ninety four percent of Democrats support Rourke Ninety three percent of Democrats or\nRepublicans support crews like the real difference there is that the the narrow band of true independents that we were we were talking about earlier right now are breaking for work\nBy about twelve points fifty one thirty nine on one hand that's good news for work on the other hand there aren't enough independence for him for that to to push him over the line I think it it helps closed the gap in the polling but it it doesn't put them over the line\nWell what's interesting too you don't get the especially with the ... election is you only do well no it's all about voter turnout and I know this is just a tiny little snapshot but on day one of open voting in Harris County\nUh they set a record and they have not had a day below sixty thousand since the the the amount of people who are turning out\nFor early voting is at record levels we haven't seen anything like this we haven't seen who levels like this anything like this in the mid term I don't know that we've seen levels like this in in a in a presidential year in Harris County\nYeah they've been they've been really high and I think that I haven't seen the I've been checked in today on on what the updates are\nSort of busy dealing with this poll but I Do know that they were beginning to level up a little bit but not so much the you know they're not still very impressive it you know we're seeing the underpinnings of that reflect in our polling you know the voter enthusiasm is very high\nI mean the eighty seven percent said that they were extremely are very interested in voting we expect people to inflate that a little bit but that's still\nA extremely high in the enthusiasm was was not one sided it's basically even between Democrats and Republicans so it's a real [noise] you know it's a it's a real face off here in Texas\nIn between the two parties and I think you put I think you have to still give the advantage to Republicans because if it's if there's parity then that means the Republicans are likely maintaining their baseline advantages\nYeah would you call it would you go to a new use the term enthusiasm to me it's more motivation you may not be enthusiastic even necessarily about your candidate but you are are are so dead set against the uh the candidates opponent that you are completely motivated to turn up the vote\nYeah I think that I think that's fair and I think I think we're seeing a lot of that and I think the fact that there's a lot of that there's a lot of parity between the two parties in whatever you were going to call that motivation\nTo vote reflected in in the other races so you know we found like a lot of other polls have found governor out but you know up you\nKnow a lot over the Democratic candidate loop about as we had\nHim leading fifty six thirty seven I'm you know in the face of a very week's challenge from from Luca Valdez him you know we talked about the independence sort of breaking for work in the Senate race well they're breaking even more strongly for Abbott and the governor's race so muggy independence\nUm they they favor out at fifty nine thirty over Valdez and I think looking at those numbers explains part of why\nThere's this difference between how cruises running and how Abbott is running and of course all this is a is a much less widely noted is much less effective candidate\nAnd so you know she's running basically about twelve points behind O'Rourke in the governor's race if\nThe issue take a look and I know you're only keeping ... you know kind of a quick I and some of the congressional races are going on and have you ever feel gym for which raised more races would be the most competitive election day\n[noise] yeah well I think um you know you guys have the race down there the ... and races you know he's very hot race that people are watching\nUm the sessions right you know the and the you know ... percent is the incumbent their Pete Sessions has to challenge up in the Dallas area and other incumbent Republican [noise]\nUm and then you begin to start wondering where the sleepers are you know further down south and kind of north central central Texas really John Carter's she\nSeems to be a pretty hotly contested she one thing that's interesting is that well one of the races that was on everybody's list going on is this the the will hurt seat Texas twenty three which stretches from El Paso down to San Antonio and has been one of the few\nConsistently competitive seats in Texas for the last you know several cycles he seems to have actually um\nYou know being less trouble than people thought so those are all races were watching was you know we expect there will be some surprises I mean we had nine retirements in in the delegation of thirty six this time so there's more open seats and in and\nLikely to be more surprises a lot of this will depend on on how turnout continues to sustain through election day\nAll right Jim thank you so much wealth of information I appreciate you taking the time felt to me today You're welcome happy to be with Jimmy take care of this Jim Henson University of Texas joined us here on AM nine fifty K. P. R. C. interesting guy um oh one more update here\nOn a um Mr pipe bomb or say off at least the bad accused of that the\nSeminal tribe and Florida owners\nOf the hard rock cafe franchise\nDistancing themselves from Caesar say the suspect on\nTwitter described himself as the current booking agent sales marketing promotions project manager live events at seminal hard rock live which is a well known concert venue on several tribal land in Hollywood, Florida\nA spokesperson for the tribe says that no safe or say or anybody who went by any other illnesses that he's known for is either a member of the tribe or an employee\nOf the company so it may be a case where he put down a job that doesn't really exist okay I'm sure we'll learn a lot more about this guy over the weekend and blood mourners mourn to a Monday the Monday morning bright and early ... was your wire and used in the morning news and back here\nMonday afternoon at three in Haiti RC [noise]\nMe while\nIn Texas and\nMaybe are fifty ... Texas\nReal saw\nThe gallery furniture mated America studios\nRadio station your\nBack in ... ... ... in Florida and it's already said Sandy explosive devices through the mail targeting high profile Democrats and other knocking can't ... the\nFrom writer as us attorney general Jeff Sessions said on friday that these are stay on the suspect in Leeds Thirteen suspicious packages into prominent Democrats and others isn't the custody of the FBI has been charged with five federal crimes\nAnd see how things in the fifty eight years in prison and found guilty sessions sat at a press conference denouncing the charges we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially political violence he said\nAt the agents arrested say oxygen the sixth in plantation Florida and also how the way white van plastered with pro Trump stickers the slogan CNN sucks and images of democratic figures with Red Cross hairs over their faces\nAt the high director Christopher Wray told a news conference fingerprints on a package didn't the congresswoman Maxine Waters were confirmed to be that other say how can you also said there could be other packages\nAnd reporting by Zachary ... at all and he got\nThere you go All right I had not heard about the the Democrats with crosshairs over them this is on the outside of the ... uh yes I was on the Troy Christian Rousseff swagger to driving down the road and plantation Florida which is not just desolate a lot of people down there\nAnd he's got crosshairs through pictures of prominent Democrats and nobody noticed it\nAnd he uses a you know ... Trump supporter although records show he was a registered Democrat until two thousand sixty\nTwo thousand sixteen he registered as Republicans for some reason not be widely reported but he wasn't registered Democrat\nWhose name as you say is Cesar ... says are or what is it ... say oc say ... you also went by ulterior something um I don't know what the guys or this or that he is but I've heard people describe him as white\nUm I Would say that he's he's not white in the traditional sense he's a guy that has I'm guessing mixed heritage\nI've heard of American that was much describes one today\nRight and that would make sense but also Cesar Chavez or it could be there were some Hispanic in their ... you know it's true though Gary it doesn't matter right you're right if he did it he's a piece of crap he should not have done it I think the good lord above none of these bombs blew up\nThank the good lord above a potential bad guy is off the streets but there are a lot of questions when it comes to this\nAnd we don't have a lot of answers now Gary Locke you best news anchor so I took it a bit so what'd she gets more information drug program will bring it to you having said that it definitely bears us\nGetting into how the media the far left legacy media is representing this they're calling him ... or ... bomber\nWhich would be make America great again they also have and I've seen kind of runs in color graphics from CNN and other outlets that say I'm the bombers targeting Trump targets which is not true\nTrump never set on targeting these people go and get them that's not true so it doesn't make any sense but I'll ask you this\nIf you're an ass wagon enough [noise]\nTo use the term Margot bomber or say that the bombers going after Trump Trump targets were you also reporting that the guy that showed up at the congressional baseball practice and almost killed Steve ... are you calling him to Sanders shooter\nHe was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter or I've heard people call him a ... a Bernie Bro\nIt was never reported that way in fact his background wasn't talked about much at all a bunch of young country music fans were shot up in Las Vegas a year ago not much about that guy's political backgrounds talked about is it or why he chose a country music concert\nI I'm not blaming Hillary Clinton for that I'm not blaming Maxine Waters for the guy that that shot Steve ... so why is it that the legacy media things that can get away with pretending like this is something Trump did or that Trump supporters are on hinged and this is the thing we do\nI'm a Trump supporter do I appear to be somebody that we do something like this and if you say yes unity it if you say no your common sense you know logical rational person\nSomebody who would do something like this or shoot up the baseball game or blow up the Oklahoma City federal building these are not jobs these are bad guys these are bad people doing bad things\nYou know the guy that that shot Gabby Giffords out in Arizona several years back turns out he had a questionable political background most of it leaning left we don't talk about that much about what we do\nIs we always and by we I mean the legacy media the legacy media always homes in on if there is an angle that will expose the person to somebody on the right Terry you'll recall I'm guessing that when the the bad guy in Aurora, Colorado shut up that movie theatre mhm\nYou'll recall that Brian Ross who's now been just excommunicated from ABC News or what he's doing now um but he reported that there is a person with the same name registered as part of Colorado Tea Party group\nI Do remember that was that the right guy no one's nine\nBut of course it when he makes the connection this is a little CSI online makes the connection instead of verifying it finding out that the guy that he found who had a\nSimilar name where are the same name was Thirty years older maybe he could have thought to himself you know Brian if you're if you have any integrity and ... and ... as a reporter you won't report that it could be this guy because you know it's not there's a there's an age discrepancy\nBut instead it's easier to just go with it I think the good lord I think the authorities for getting this potential bad guy off the street\nHe's got a questionable background he was a manager for chip and Dell dancers or something that's not necessarily very conservative thing to do um but even if he were the most\nThrough in through Trump supporter you can find\nThere is nothing about what the president says does or or alleges or or pushes that would make a Trump supporter do horrible things attempting to kill people\nThere just is no connection there ... there there was an attempt here to make a connection that doesn't exist\nAnd when the president comes out and says let's stay together and what we think of it as one is it galvanized America we can overcome things like this and let's get the bad guy off the streets and thank God that got him he they used to be mocked for that too so at some point we have to realize that the left doesn't want to get along with the right\nThe left doesn't want to see this guy in the White House as a human being that isn't telling people to go blow up members of Congress are former presidents\nThat just isn't who he is but I guess it gets ratings I guess it gets viewers I guess it gets the numbers that they need to sustain themselves because this really this is about reality this is about the media not doing what the job is supposed to be\nWe're going to Megan Kelly is well I sent out a a an open commenter on Twitter today saying you're never going to be accepted by NBC News you should have known that going in good for you you got a bunch of money for your family but the minute you apologize was the minute you were out\nBecause an apology carry your you and I have not talked about this but I Wonder if\nYour mother were um going hear an apology is an admission of what I'm a guilt right in my Iran guys to you that means I I did something wrong right\nWhen she apologized that was an admission that she's a racist which I don't believe she is she never should've apologize especially not because fat as a you know I'm a which is the amount of ... had something to say about it [noise] they carry our ... in the past few years is famous for going to the White House and pumping Hispanic\nYes again for that I'm not exaggerating yes\nWhen I say that he's famous for going to the White House going to the bathroom and his pants and throwing the underwear out in the White House ... that's the guy Megan Kelly couch to just\nTo make sure that we're all hearing and understanding what's going on now she's going to sue over fifty million dollars and you know what you'll probably get it but she never ever ever never should apologize because that was her admitting yes what I said was racist because what she said wasn't racist you and I discussed it do you think what you said was racist\nAnd no I don't think that I don't think I don't think she meant in that way certainly\nI don't think she ever said the term black face\nShe said why people aren't allowed to to to to the dark and their skin black people aren't allowed to white near skin I'm ... and I don't understand why you're impersonating somebody you're going on in a while we can cost him I don't think she ever ... end up by the way it's being reported by the far left you know outlets that she said black faces okay\nNo she said both times you brought it up she said lightning or darkening as questionable I'm Wondering why it is\nI think it's a valid conversation in fact we had the conversation about it that afternoon it is it eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com lots to get to on this program stay writer\n[noise]\nCared less than ... take care of\nFor\nMany bedrooms bedtime is well complicated\nEspecially as the weather it begins to cool well one person

needs to be blown off the map once and for all we something seminal tribe agree I don't I guess he's talking about cause human mentioned that he might be Native American ...\nAnd then you can find himself as a tweet to that\nIs beyond time to unleash ISIS\nSo let me ask you something President Trump is almost completely eliminated ISIS he's been bombing the hell out of ISIS and wiping them off the map\n... does anybody think very supporter of president Donald Trump would want to bring ISIS in to take out TMZ\nLet's use our brains here now again like I understand that if you're far left and you need to be hate filled you can't use your brain because then you'll have to be open to actual logic commonsense reason use your head\nI I've never heard a Trump supporter say let's call it I says to help us out\nNo we Trump supporters say I support the president taking out ISIS just a little bit different than what's being presented here let me go to the phone lines into say load welcome to and again it's a free speech rights Eddie that could be could be brought up anything and everything ... did you notice that nobody's talking about the ...\nI did notice as a matter of fact I ... ...\nNow I Know that you have because you're a professional damage man then yeah you know I'm ... I'm Still trying trying to work out of my head whether or not I can you know lift those one twenty ... posted the thing is you\nKnow yeah ...\nNo I didn't try again will be till next week before I Try again but um I think that you're going to be helpful in that [noise]\nSo you know being a tiny [laughter]\nAn hour and sound like they go home late Benny why what is that time now in many ways it's so hard and life is that you're you sound like ten years old I Know a little tiny [laughter] I'm\nGoing to make that my research shows you how many of these actually up yes some play that game ... wanted him next week\nLet me go to the full lives they load welcome to our Sean and who is ah in Kenya like show what's going on\n[noise] much showing your audio let's go or you\nKnow there you go looking to see that as soon as as soon as you came on and carry a hung up on his mind now I heard listening I'm going to let people know something\nRight up front and this is this is going to be for anybody who you're going to when you're on hold that means you're probably going to get on stay with your face on the phone spina host says you're up say something go here we go let's go back out and say Hi to Charles in San Antonio Charles\nGreat thanks real quick 'cause I Know up against a great ... okay a separate all Puerto Rican that's what they said he is a for the bomber okay second thing dateline NBC I Know you don't like them tonight there's going to be a segment\nOn a murder that took place ten years ago a a lady that was a young girl that was killed by an illegal\nOr because he fled to Mexico and we had to make a deal with them right the only thing that connects with the the Alamo is at one of the candidates such running for land commissioner that was his ex girlfriend or an old girlfriend of his and he's going to be on there okay and last but not least\nA ... a verification uncovered ... on a K walking Castro we've ... you'll go you'll see his father his father's around retired teacher from the edge what school district that's all at sites\nAre by the way ... short and sweet they're calling him a seminal Puerto Rican\nAnd that is the first Iron Man okay but what you said probably ... American indian he had an additive and describe your lungs of American yeah you know what you're talking about being a seminal yeah uh on on Twitter\nUm why is anybody calling him white\nAnd again this is not me trying to say white people and do this at white people can be bad too but why not report what he really is you know what I mean we building cities are white guy I don't know\nThe whole thing is we're going to keep on telling you the truth is awarded to do it is I ate at eight nine four one ... to be Kevin Brady vows ways and Means Committee chair when we come back he's the guy who's working with the president on all these tax cuts and then some eighty nine for one pack Joe packs dot com ... [noise]\nYou know palm [noise]\n\n\nThe\n\n\n\nTopic was what is suffering emails\nThat are more right there also Newsmax TV Joe ... show glad to have you here really glad to have back the house ways and Means Committee chaired the Republican from district date the great state of Texas is Kevin Kevin how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on what what\nAn incredible time we're living right now I Want to get into the incredible succession the positivity\nThat came out of at that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today I'm first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI shows was this idiot but sent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you\nThink yeah that was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history of uh of problems you are and then sending in in threatening\nTo blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that frankly um\nAnd I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lot and right now he picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I ... it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a Ari Fleischer advice early on he said you know someone stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling you a demographer bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber ... new people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball\nIf there's an almost killed these college they didn't call him a C ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I will tell you uh do I play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or apt I took some a swing city one takes some ground or is the second I looked out\nThe was take them now I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is all the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric\nThey often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine wandering Cory Booker\nOr encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well of violence happens they made it happen I mean we we we'd like to see them\nTamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to blame the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished ineffective thirty five forty years later the media looks back at ... lovingly and and they do love and back then\nUm and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that are ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half\nReally and then you put on top of that this amazing a record in the courts of a constitutional judges from the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or the the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your Joe I Want to come on but I only have two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking pencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nJust tell he is delivering for Texas in a big way and I think look in the house we have our backs to the wall history says we don't uh keep the house like a lot of tough races in the day I Believe we do because because Republicans and conservatives are now turning out and understand this is not a mid term this is really about\nYou know keeping its House Senate this economy this president in place\nIt's our house ways and Means Committee chair Kevin ... Republican the great state of Texas Kevin my friend I appreciate the time was platoon thanks so take care okay All right back after this and the Joe ... show stay right here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather begins to cool well one person sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot bowling branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets loved by three us presidents\nIs offering luxury flannel betting for a limited time at bowling range dot com they're unbelievably solved warm and reasonable so everyone\nStays the right temperature the flannel sheets coming forging studying patterns in colors you're guaranteed to find a style you love\nPlus you could try them for thirty nights risk free but whatever you do don't wait last year there flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks so go to bowling branch dot com today for fifty dollars off of your first set of ... plus free shipping with promo code ...\n... dollars off plus free shipping right now at bowling branch dot com used my code pegs P.

I may be missed remembering this but Ronald Reagan appear to me to do more press conferences more news conferences where he would actually take the questions from the media\nTrump will do you know sort of announcements he'll walk out and and on the fly he'll take some questions Obama almost never took all the questions he be quite frankly even though the media was his buddy uh he he didn't want to sit there and be questioned by anybody\nWhat do you think Reagan did that is it because that was the only available way to get it out there and because of that is that why it appears as though he had a friendly relationship would they Sam Donaldson even even though the ... was always ... working at um were sniping\nActually your analysis is pretty good I I'm reading the script almost almost because the cameras pointed out and we're not as all he had to work with media message out he couldn't speak directly to the American people uh you know I I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jesse Kelly Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "26"}
