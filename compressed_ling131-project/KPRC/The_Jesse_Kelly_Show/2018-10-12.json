concerned about that the ability or Google to manipulate information and swing people vote to their men for the independent psychological research that shows a Google could wind up to twenty to forty percent off undecided voters\nBecause they had to humanize the information they received through Google structured as objective and unbiased\nUnlike you may have to CNN or Fox or any other company that that has\nA sort of a little bit biased but\nYou know that that hasn't been any proposals for ah like I said in so far that just an irritant amendment so I doubt will see anything for him off at

but alum bakari with Breitbart joining us here on Cape Cod I'm nine fifty I have one more time to hang on to say it's got to reload I've got one more kind of way up to work for you Kanye West has become the biggest story the last forty dollars because of his president a presidential meeting\nUm because of all the media coverage about it because of all the attempts to paint him as being thoroughly insane because after all how the world could see where a make America great again hat\nAnd be supportive of President Trump unless they use insane so they're covering it from every conceivable Engel including a story that just popped up on CNN yeah so I ... through those people just to see what they're doing a here's the headline from CNN Kim card the action is not embarrassed about Kanye West visit with Trump\nFollowed it televised meeting described by some as a disaster they put that in quotes who who described it as a disaster\nDon't know the ... they don't tribute to commit to anybody he says you might be wondering what those closest to county was thought it was Thursday visit with President Trump\nA source close to the Kurdish and family told CNN again an unnamed source all these stories about name sources\nA source close to the Kurdish rebel he told CNN the west white Tim Garton Ash and is quote not embarrassed by her husband's comments and what'd you spoke about an alternate universe dropped some profanity and argue the time does not exist\nI must have missed that part about time that existing\nGoes on to say that Kim is incredibly supportive edited west mind moves at lightning speed and suggested the form for the White House meeting wasn't the best representation of western genius\nWell spices little wife has such a high ... to ... have been right head of her husband's visit with President Trump production told extras that she was looking forward to it saying I always say he isn't the best communicator because the best hearts he knows

you hear about it like the will to hit earlier today you know claiming that ... clearly insane and despite what he says about being missed diagnosed with bipolar disorder clearly is nice clearly not on his bed he has a tendency to ramble as some people do\nBut that doesn't mean that what he's saying is based on insanity if I'm going to follow that logic that I'm going to have to think that everybody supports President Trump's insane and I certainly don't believe that for a second\nAll right the weekend is here for me and hopefully for you to have a great weekend see it Monday morning early by being on Katie are rich and right back here Monday afternoon at three on cable or see [noise]\nThe gallery furniture mated America studios\n\n\nOn his way home ...

Hey Joe hey I've got a question for you about an underreported story sure what you know about cardinal veto\nMake a ex cardinal mechanic and the abuse scandal is going through the Catholic Church right now\nI don't know anything about it other than I don't like the pope's response to it and the reason why I left the Catholic Church many many years ago non denominational Christian now is because of how they mishandled how disgusting um a lot of his abusive was that it they they they hid it they will priests around I don't know about the specific ones that you just you just mentioned though\nA mechanic formerly the archbishop of Washington I'm resigned being a cardinal because of allegations are credible and substantiate it accusations that he had abused minors and seminarians during the course of his time either as pre store bishop in his\nPrevious it um appointments okay I'm going to do a\nLot of our wait till you only have a minute ah but but here's my bottom line\nIf these guys have huge letter you guys are they staying there there are these guys have credible accusations and their ... and the corroborated they should be tried they should be held accountable new should be justice that's what I Believe we break your back after this and the joke\nWhen we're not in the constitution for any protections except for the right to vote I think that allows for perspective of a lesser than a lot of that\nAnd I'll just put us women on equal footing in the legal system particularly in\nAreas where women have historically been treated like second class citizens especially in cases of domestic violence and sexual assault\nAt the string of me to scandals involving Hollywood that congressional and news your leaders have reignited interest in constitutional protections against sexual discrimination when the ugly drama over Kavanaugh's confirmation poured gasoline on it\nAnd she had millions of women again at the systems in the country do not represent or defend them same Carol robust her ... president and the E L a T E R A coalition\nAnd play the next battle must be the one to amend the constitution to put women in it and she said\nI like to officials and they limited progress and changing laws in the wake of me to scandals any are advocates same and make the most definitive difference because it would not be subject to the whims of legislators and presidents\nAnd then that might maybe just one stayed away from ratification after Nevada ratified it in March of two thousand Seventeen and Illinois may even if it is ratify by thirty eight state there will still be giant legal hurdles for the amendment\nAdvocates say the record number of women running for office in the possibility of a democratic wave election in November could help push it forward\nVoters elected more new went into Congress in Nineteen Ninety two than any previous decade after professor Anita Hill testified\nOn sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas during his confirmation to the Supreme Court representative Carolyn Maloney a Democrat from New York any rights advocate who was among those elected that year for the Kavanaugh for hearing well once again galvanized limited though because so many women are outraged and identify with Ford\nYeah just stupid I mean just the both of a couple of wires first of all I'm ... the whole idea that somehow and eat a hill is why more women ran a who's done that study I haven't seen that study maybe it was just time maybe they're just doing more women running and I'm fine with men or women running I don't care who runs a and I'm I'm a\nMan [noise] evil man white Campbell man\nNamed wilderness so yeah I'm a worse than the worst although again southern Italian so I I'm not really a wasp so that might actually change among Anglo but either way at the end of the day Alyssa Milano ... that you just dynamite\nIn many Wyoming really Newsmax times is bang you know did you get these got to be worked for that one at\nNo she did not\nKnow matter what happens wrong as you say OK daddy I run it just it was great it was just love between Schwarzenegger into Arab and Melissa mulatto but up at the bottom line\nFor me is she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about why on earth do we need an equal rights amendment\nThe constitution is for all Americans the constitution covers everybody\nIt because it gives you ... is not for men\nAnd women just have to do with their husbands say and for anybody in this day and age and the first world nation like the United states of America to suggest that we are the country\nThat needs to be taken to task because we somehow treat women unfairly or or on the equally that somebody who is just not very smart albeit a great actress when she was nine I'm\nLooking Saudi Arabia\nDoes look look at Egypt look at how people are treated in Yemen look at even Afghanistan look at those countries and you tell me that women are treated equally you know when a woman is really deemed to be fifty percent of a man\nWhen a woman if she doesn't cover to her ankles there are ... police in Saudi Arabia to come and tell her you better cover your ankles\nYou told me about you know inequality for women in the most equal country on planet earth\nIn fact our laws guaranteeing equality for women and if you aren't being treated equally there are laws that will be your records you can bring redress or the government why she acting so stupid I don't understand does she think people will believe that there is some ER a coalition\nNow if you want to talk about what women in the movies aren't making anywhere near as much as ... well that's about getting equal pay for equal work you talk to the movie makers about that I Will start a new movie if you don't pay me as much as you pay the guy and then they go on to a different woman or they they rise up to your your demands that's a different thing completely that's\nNot a constitutional that's not about rights that's not about equal treatment\nUnder the law I mean what exactly does she think an eerie amendment would have an equal rights amendment would do\nI Love the Ford would have been just as incredulous and just as uncorroborated as she was last week\nAnd you are a and the constitution as a unnecessary would be doing that and be it would not have changed a damn thing that happened in the
