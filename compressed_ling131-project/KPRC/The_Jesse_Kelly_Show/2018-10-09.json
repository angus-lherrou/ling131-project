{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Busy time election and that certainly the U.S Senate race is dominating the airwaves right now a governor Atta starting getting his share of TV ads his helicopter out I think is just fantastic if you haven't seen it I probably haven't turned the TV on lately um but I\nKnow Texas is a huge media markets state and it's a serious crackers and she'll run to run ads when you have the Dallas media market at the Houston market and then of course an attorney or any of itself is larger than some in many states so you'll have it's very expensive to buy media here\nOn and so so trying to flip Texas is a very expensive proposition and George Soros\nLiberal allies progressive allies have been trying to do that now\nI'm for several cycles of course most famously probably with Wendy Davis\nA which failed significantly um and you know it looks\nTo be again the governor of it will be a riding high to re election this time around um center Kearns also has started to really put the contrast on\nWith I'm Better off work and you know Beto could only go down from where he was because once people start to ... starting to find out exactly who he is how liberal he as\nHis socialist agenda highly support socialist policies I such a joke that he's saying doesn't want President Obama's adores meant like that's going to matter to anybody and full anyone that have some sort of a centrist when he's out there talking about um you know federal workers out there talking about wanting to abolish ice wanting to\nCriminalize border crossings um killed horrific um support for Planned Parenthood ah he just he and he voted against Harvey relief self he voted against Harvey relief on this guy can't get any more liberal\nUm he voted with only for Democrats it was such a bad move for him to vote against Harvey relief that the former Houston Press\nCalled it completely ridiculous\nSo as voters are finding out who federal work as there certainly liking them less and less\nCan you can you [laughter] you know you're you're mentioning poli due to just go is there any way to get an accurate polling data anymore I you know the last presidential election to proven to us the the pools are really meaningless at this point are thing or you can maybe system as a trend\nWell people famously tell you that poll is a snapshot in time on and so that's why it's important to look at these numbers on a trend line and put them together you know with um either surveys that are being done by that same poster\nOr um you know taking them in the context of other other surveys that are being done um so are pulled accurate there a snapshot in time the only survey and the only pulled it actually matters is what happens on election day [laughter]\nSo sort of Rouge is you take a look at 'em you know how these campaigns are conducting themselves we we will sit on news this morning about um how how there's so much money involved with the Texas election\nThat literally almost every television station you can do the political commercials are back to back to back to back and you'll hear one for the Republican one Democrat one for the next Republican one for the next demographic back and forth back and forth is that affected was such a way to advertise\n[noise] well the ah the buyer doesn't really have a say in ... when they're out runs during particular program they by the time during a program and hope for the best so it is always interesting to see how the how it comes up and uh you know when it's actually played on the air\nAnd you start to see these ads running backs back I you know I take it out there to the voters to ask that and I always I always enjoy sing a you know two candidates and the same race back to back a because usually the messages are remarkably different and you really get a pretty clear contrast\nAnd who they are so ah but yeah you know I\nTalked it on television is is still one of the top ways that people received their information about these elections at about these campaigns ah and that's why you continue to see t._v. ... just a a monster when it comes to a modern day campaigns I get around it\nOr the laugh a little bit over the weekend every now and again you know because I Do this we're living in the same way because you got to do this for a living I I I get to the point where we're just going to need to escape for a little while they'll go go to my happy place for a couple of hours or something something mindless you know like HDTV fixer upper\nOkay if you can't say for the books are up are you taking about Texas so what was going on when he was ... which are up or\nYou know I see all kinds of political ads coming through\nDarn I did run away from them there's nowhere to run or the high desert\nNo yeah thrown off every single device every single electronic device and that just sit still [laughter] well insurance then it'll marketing ad on a radio at less than a television you know you can't get away from it right\nNow I actually this I Will say this this is a shameless plug for the medium that I Am in at least we seem to have a continuity department you'll not backed about political ads on this radio station ... noted doing we we separate them so [laughter] just like we wouldn't we wouldn't have to car dealers back to back we don't have to public political ads for the same office going back to bed\n[laughter] that's a that's a little more local thank you [laughter] that's a good fun to talk to you thank you so much for your time today\nThank you so much look forward to it again you all have good afternoon\nTo just go cologne Republican strategist joining us You're on TV or see nine fifty a yeah that was fun um I I think that that segment proves to be that but you can have an enjoyable conversation about politics sometimes [laughter]\nJust like it if you like the tweet the only person who's got access to Sarah Palin or on Twitter which is at surfing usa would be her or her family in or those who surround her and they're managing you know social media so they're not liking it they're not so I'm telling you even carry him I'm like yeah this is in her\nI didn't believe that there's no way this is our elderly come on somebody making up so that I gave sand the phone number I said called in and say tell people what you said to me um I said that it was her no tell me what you said before you called\n\nYou forget I forgot what I what what did I say I'm not calling her and said well you said I'm embarrassed because it ... it could have been anybody\nIn Alaska but if it really was\nSarah Palin I mean that hides Sam calling I just thought this era pilot so are you did eventually call we took twenty second for you to say no and he said yes and you called and now you're not talking to me at all and the radio in the hour talking to me for a little chat thing that we do and not getting anything from you or something like is it her and your audience for was yes\nSo scary that point you're still thinking it's not her on hold now even rent land behind that off it's not her yeah and I'm ... and then a same says I'm Kelly I'm pretty sure\nThat she's a some guy named Todd ... her husband [laughter] so so so I said well just hang up with them and we hit a breaker we're in an interview that I taped earlier or something and I actually called the number\nAnd taught it as going back to hold him accountable if we do it why what is happening right now so I'm ... hold on a second he's the phone\nTo um to a a a\n... to Sarah persons things or how I judge Sarah said no no it's not this is not Sarah bailing now saying that I design I'm saying it's not Sarah ... percent or not\nAnd um and I said is that an iPhone she said the yeah they're all iPhones and said can I face time you right now and they face time there and it was in fact Sarah Palin and and I showed it to you out of those and I don't know that I told her that I was going to post I didn't post a picture\nAnd I'm In and we got to talking and it was great actually says I couldn't get through the phone lines that were too busy to Michael it's a busy show on the phone line so yeah I mean that I'm with you um\nSo yeah that that's that's how it all went down I was like well I only have like two minutes left in the show do you want to come on you know not only to come and you want to tell you that you've been a great point or the Ninth Circuit court of appeals entered anybody else say that and and it's exactly what would happen to Murkowski's this that and the others we were talking with him over the weekend and long story short we have Sarah ... but on the show today\nAnd uh well that'll be bottom of our number two at least seven thirty eastern time and we're to talk of easy Kerry is she going to run against Murkowski you oh\nI don't know are we going to find a way to find out oh okay\nOkay and also I wanted to compare and contrast to her family was treated in two thousand eight with how cabinet and his family had been treated in um ... in this\nRidiculous last month we just had\nAnd how is it that Murkowski says she's a Republican once you've got real issues the first amendment in Second Amendment and now her excuse for why Kevin I wasn't the guy was just because he's not the right guy\nAt the right time which doesn't make any sense and by the way does Lisa Murkowski get to walk away from the vote on Saturday for those of you had your heads in the sand yes he is now a Supreme Court justice and Lisa Murkowski voted no\nBut then she resented the vote did you see all that go down ... my dad yeah I think about that I mean I'm like what the ... so I'm\nVery interesting very interesting we talked about all of that and then some and are those of you who see it on television it'll be on Newsmax TV as well\nShe's like standing next to a beautiful lake in in Alaska oh how nice and what is going on here in ... you know what I mean that claim easing shot yeah so I Will have her on its or any they nine four one Seventy four seven eight nine four one path eggs\nAnd it's not really about Sarah Palin already done the interview and bring a ticket about an hour and a half but this really is about what happened this weekend you do have a um a justice Kavanaugh\nWas it fifty one forty seven is that what it ended up being or is it fifty forty seven\nAnd believe that simply forty eight\nHundred and forty acres dangerous out and yeah fifty forty eight 'cause Danes and Murkowski we're both Danes was actually at his daughter's wedding and Murkowski ended up rescinding her vote so she just vote for president although the first time around she did vote no and that's important that people of Alaska need to realize she did say no to justice cabin on she never give a good reason why\nThen the idiots tried to protest and then who were scratching at the Supreme Court door which made no sense I mean the whole thing it's just been dumb um\nWell the Democrats now take a breath and back off or are they going to um to continue this ridiculous outrage for no reason at eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com stay

going on today lots of do want to get to just to let you know I don't know what I was talking about last half hour because it was different in different stations in different markets so pretend you didn't hear the last half hour and then we just start a new hand the big news today would you agree that the big news of the day has to be Nikki Haley is\nDefinitely a lot of people found that as a shocker this morning\nThe un secretary or the UN ambassador Nikki Haley is a is stepping down was an immediate she's going to stay through the end of the the end of the year and um I don't see this is any sort of all\nThere's the people I don't I don't see it as that often times after an election whether it be mid term or general you'll see a switch over on some pieces of the administration having said that\nI like Dicky Haley ah and I like the job that she's done at the un I think we should represented us very very well\nI was and I wonder if you're a viewer spies were British surprised weather's too I was surprised that the president chose her because early on she appeared to\nBe a never Trump or I now I Do remember that\nSo to me that's a little bit odd but um but God Bless her\n... well known for that in this administration oh I think without a doubt and really well now yeah\nI think without a doubt another three or four names that are being bandied about um I I don't I don't know that much about any of them but as as the word comes out will certainly ... will stay on top of that you have the entire story what she's doing that I pretty much explain it all\nI Do have a story here if you'd like ant\nWhile you're on the news person could you do something to that you would sit around for half an hour rounded\nOkay yeah I haven't seen the ads Nikki Haley you ... the United nations is leaving her post at the end of the year President Trump announced in the oval office Tuesday Morning Haley's replacements unclear on the Trump said he will likely to like the new ambassador in the next two or three weeks\nAnd we pillar bought her she will not run for office in two thousand twenty and instead of campaign for the president\nAnd an attempt to clash speculation she might charge her own political course challenging hand\nI Will will say that's for all of either going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for two thousand twenty master told reporters I can promise you what I Will be doing is campaigning for this one that I look forward and supporting the president and the next election Mr Trump meeting with Hayley in the oval office informed reporters Tuesday Haley until ... six months ago she wanted a break\nAnd presidents inhaling isn't very special to him they hate the loser and the people will be in constant touch Mr Trump to help ... you can come back to the strange it in the future adding you can have your pack\nAll right so there you go ... which odd to me is that there would be any speculation about her running against him who's the journalists that asked that question\nI don't know I don't know\nSo you've worked for this guy and he he named you one of the highest level positions in the administration in the cabinet now that you're leaving hey you run into twenty twenty what\nI think so yes 'cause he's an incredibly popular president\n\nWhat do you get paid for Clinton you've you've figured it was a done deal mhm he did not help her there's some would say well he did help her she did a lot better than she would have otherwise done um so you can't really say\nThat um\nThat it wasn't helpful I I guess that's true you can't quantify maybe more people did vote for her because of Obama and she's still lost useful lost by more I guess you could make that case\nBut what's interesting to me is that what do you when he goes in campaign for somebody for Congress they don't do very well\nSo you see the Robert Francis doesn't want him to endorse him I did see that the sound on mood matter of fact so all man have you heard that story I Am a good thing to do even hold onto it and that I Do a little ... but but but\nI I Want to hear that I I find that to be kind of amazing a means I'm only talking about super\nBeats you know super beach helped out with your nitric oxide nitric oxide as a miracle molecule that we produce ourselves that gives us that extra energy how does it do that it helps our circulation helps her blood flow helps her cardiovascular system I'm super beach\nTakes the idea of nitric oxide\nAnd helps your body boost the production of an of nitric oxide the reason why when we get older we start

also free shipping with your purchase\nEight hundred five one six eighty three eighty nine or go on line Joe loves beats dot com right now\nOr Kerry pleased to help us with Robert Francis ... calls himself into a plea he does he's not looking for an endorsement from former President Obama I was stunned by this\nThis is from the blaze former president bronco bonnet recently released along less than two hundred and sixty democratic candidate he's endorsing across the U.S\nJust before the November midterm elections that talks and from that candidate beta or work was noticeably missing US Congressman from El Paso told to bordering at a recent campaign and then he did not want Obama's endorsement because it didn't help candidates in previous elections I don't think we're interested in endorsement or work during the recent town hall meeting the Texas Tribune report and\nI'm so grateful to him for his service he's going down as one of the greatest president from ... elections unpacked is\nAbout is not dilemma in Texas Democrats according to the Tribune work is hoping I'm the income that Republican Senator Ted Cruz on November ... works and he defeated for my debts\nFrank representatives disaster raising the two thousand twelve Democratic primary despite the fact ray interesting endorsements from Obama and former President Bill Clinton according to the Tribune Bill Clinton's build up the county ... screaming I'll pass the times front page headlines of president urges I'll pass through to stick with Iran they work that\nAnd we won and what that drove home for me is that someone else's popularity has not transferable to a given candidate\nAnd the political reporting it's called the race a toss up at recent polls show cruise headed toward Emerson College Tom Cruise I had my five point that it certainly among likely voters and CBS News poll shows cruise leading a war by six points among registered voters\nSo here's the question is it ... it really is it a nature in that in that story but I Wonder if you've heard anything\nDid he not want it or did he just not get it\nOn the story and says he didn't want it I don't think we're end well\nNo it isn't I mean well okay but when he's not going to say that you think he's really going to say well in the ... Obama did not want to get the one that we're going to go out there and saying we weren't interested anyway\nWell let's say that Obama puts on a list and you're running for election to use your name was ... of course you're each was going to be I didn't want it ... mind as you're not going to start to believe it did Moore's being ... you're not going to say that but I I Want to know the real scoop I Want to know the true story\nDid he just not get it or the duty as President Obama to not endorse him inquiring minds wander no don't we\nI Do but I don't think we're ever going to get that answer can you call back though can you call them I Know your town ... campaign not really that uh the\nNine ... kind of neat to beat there'll be ... into now I'm the what's interesting is I I've been seeing a lot of TV ads for him and uh and and also and here's radio ads it's a lot of of just be geo there's not a whole lot of work being being talked about ... as soon not I'm not a whole lot\nNATO and and the video shows you know paid for by ... percent of the ... they're just not even saying his last movie more he's the Hispanic John F. Kennedy Robert Kennedy although he's got his medical or no you're going to put it up there\nSo so that's what's happening that's very good to me that's very interesting but he's not getting on Obama's endorsement and you know he says that though says he's not interested in an endorsement from Obama I'm betting if you would have gotten the endorsement from a bomb and he would have been interested in it\nProbably sounds\nBecause if you're Obama who do you want to back you what about people who really have a chance right of\nCourse people who they are going to win and win big\nYeah he doesn't want he already he he's getting the albatross because ... because they're real records and I don't think he wants to be part of his race to be honest with you let me go to the phone lines are quickly and I have a whole lot of time but I Want to say hello to John in one one John what's going on I\nHow're you doing tonight or what I was after a bachelor or a editor\nResignation to a tree in the ...\nWhile a by a president or your server and while\nThere were ... today that are caught a lesser rice was coming through the White House tomorrow and I was wondering if that or not ... probably the best choice for a new ambassador to the U.S\n... should be a great choice now I don't know that that has anything to do with it to be honest with you it's one of the ... the ...

I'm going to give a little bit of a of a payoff see if they could take ... ... on your condition but then I usually will soon was high stuff now if it's funny\nAnd I'm trying to sing it and it sounds like crap all still play it I don't care if I Do people make fun of me\nThat's fine it's all part of let's do it for the for the listeners ... with this was just so bad I could not bring myself to play and I wish I wish you wouldn't let us be the judge a him look I'm actually looking and and\nIt's not even on my lane is going to be more it has been deleted and file and the trash can has been emptied oh let me make sure we make sure that hold on hold on to say I mean I'm sure\nThat will ... hold on come on\nOh yeah ... you can buy buy emptying the trash no I'm not going to be fun is that I'm not going to do that song ... not just staying alive just can't do it in ... he's not even entertaining it's stupid or if it were entertaining like like I did refugee\nAnd I'm not as funny funny yeah ... ... if it's funny I still play it this wasn't funny this was actually people would have actually felt bad for me to who\nWe normally that impacts he used to have don't have an ... does not have it anymore he's done\nAnd so on Nikki Haley on the way out leaving at the end of the year she's not going to run for president in twenty twenty I didn't think she was going to carry polo Sam they didn't think she was going to for some reason the far left fake fake news media thought that was the appropriate question why are you leaving to run against him\nAnd the answer of course there's no that's actually stupid I'm ... and we don't know what the next step is for her\nGuy John ... from Michigan he he thinks that he saw ... go to the White House or something maybe she is going to be the person who knows whoever it is will be somebody um that will make sense in my opinion because this president if nothing else was appointed to really top notch people accept we're I'm going to say except for him Rosen\nNet yeah that probably there's a great mistake I wasn't going to say I heard one report that it could be a non got Trump and he said this afternoon she went it make a great and that that are into an incredible job but then you know in the rain by you know come up and ... them\nOr something she's not working with them now why why would that be any work either way I think she's been a great representative I don't care if you hate Trump you have to admit that Ivanka Trump has done a great job than everywhere she goes I mean she brings a very positive message love the United states of America I mean that's I mean seriously\nI don't know I I I don't know who would she'd be ... but but I Want to circle back to to bad though because he is saying he's not interested in the endorsement of former President Obama no I Hope it the next debate and ... is is this going to be in San Antonio I Believe so yes\nBy the way to know who the moderator is going to be going to say it\nBut and then I I just I Know is it going any yeah\nWell let me ask you something you think you think Robert for instance would ever allow me to be the moderator and ... you know well better question and the more Robert Francis would you be kind of scared if I was a motor moderator scary yeah so it's not going to go to be an ongoing thing but I'm hands but I Wonder\nAnd I hope the moderator asked this question did you ask former President Obama to not endorse you or did you not get the endorsement and then you said you're not interested in afterwards I think that's important question I think that's important um\nI don't think is going to win either way but who is winning over by shutting the top dog and the Democratic party without a doubt Obama's still the top guy the Democrat Party Hillary Clinton than she is she's not he is\nSo rejecting that just shows me really bad judgment as well not that I think it would've helped him win but I think it's certainly it just it does not making the start of the party that people like Ellen want want us to think that he is an add to that\nI guess Ellen and Taylor Swift have had this great back and forth on Twitter now about right she was to back the Democrat in Tennessee and Marsha Blackburn is no good or something ... I don't know that I've ever seen to people who are more devoid of intelligence and knowledge on actual policy than they used to\nLike they don't know why she voted against this violence against women act\nAnd um I don't I'm not sure I understand ... why don't you have a brain\nJust go and read why she rejected the left with a bunch of garbage in there that had nothing to do with women nor violence against women it was about trends this and and gave that and it was stuff it was special special interest garbage that had no place in the violence against women act and by the way it still exists\nThere was this lie in his room where the Trump somehow ended it on September thirtieth he didn't\nAnd in fact has been extended to December and this is action that Congress has to take the president has nothing to do with it so there's a lot of confusion a lot of confusion on the left right now and I got to be honest with you I think it's pretty okay\nI'm okay with there being confusion on the political left you decided they treated Kevin ... you're saying that this guy who's like the the the the heir apparent this O'Rourke\nHurt or help because\nMike Lebanon and the reason why I say this because people are now retweeted meet someone but he but he said I'm and I guess he's attacking Donald Trump junior now or something but with every tweet he makes an appearance I see him on\nHis show on likable the likeability factor for this guy is so low but\nHe keeps being asked to back because I guess he's interesting TV to the left at least but it keeps them showing back up on television and I think with every appearance his nurses system shores and it really does he does start to believe his own BS security of an opinion as he helped to hurt\nWell I think if you talk with a lot of the Democrats are saying he's definitely heard their cars and that's Democrats saying that\nI agree and by the way he was the savior for a while but lately um right now right because of the bee allegations he brought from sweating it\nThat we're so ridiculous in so extremely hard to believe um I think that that he went from studies done\nOn the left side of the aisle let me go to the phone lines are people that are about ... do they want to talk about a lot of again we're just from a lot of stuff out there today because I Do want to move on past us I Want to have some fun on the radio and TV against somebody we haven't really been able to do for a while we might not be able to\nUntil after the new number six but as soon as early on I think it's a sex look ... until we get past that

talk show and or guys walked in there all in your middle twenties and two of 'em are stand if that ... character things we think is panic\nIs not and that's how I got to talk a little bit and they rarely know where the left is that they're used for guys were in their mid twenties two of them are full four Marines vote and they said the Democratic party has lost his life\nAnd to welcome to talk to me I'm a veteran and I said you know about forty five years ago I took a oh defend their country in the constitution against all aren't into mask and right now that matched the enemy is a democratic ...\n... it's an interesting take ... and by the way I did have my my big fat head on billboards boy as can be done loading twelve years ago now I'm ... and You're welcome let me just say that You're welcome ...\nUm\nYou always forget the domestic part when we talk about defending the constitution gives all enemies foreign and domestic I think there are domestic enemies to the constitution\nI think they're on the far fringe left I think they are ... are ... I think they are radical el GB teach you X Y Z organizations I think they're Planned Parenthood\nOr that enjoys terminating unborn children\nUm I Do believe that there is an attack on an assault on the constitution for too long people who believe in and love the constitution have shut idly by and now we're sort of play catch up to say wait a second none of that was okay to the point he makes is a very good one eight eight nine four one packs Joe packs dot com\nWe could back Dr Gita loud and stay right here\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTo us there's also something called the ... festival going to do as well but as a whole because I've got a lot of people listening across the ... the ... right now how are farmers doing what we were concerned about that when the talk of terrorists started coming about\nWell farmers are under duress low prices have led to anxiety and a real economic strain up\nTheir farmers that have been in business for a while had good equity they're doing OK but some of the younger farmers it just might have started ... years ago\nOr their release stress but everyone from the commodity prices is trash and that's why I trade is so important to ah to us and that's why we're trying to restore our markets around the world\nWhen we talk about trade especially with our friends in Canada where am I had no idea about this and I spent a long time in Michigan where as you know agriculture is number two behind all making their\nI'm a I had no idea that we had such an unfair trade situation with Canada two hundred Seventy percent tariff on her dairy products alone did you know that going in and when you found out about it did you hit the ground running trying to fix that\nWell that's what President Trump did actually he's the one that cold and blew the whistle on that and give\nBlew through the flag or\nBecause uh when we understood that the uh the unfairness of not giving access our markets and then creating another system up there and their supply management system Joe where they allow their farmers over produce and export that decreasing worldwide prices affected our people\nIt was just absolutely wrong so that's why the president has so many people didn't understand\nA strategy going in I think it's been very well ... validated from his negotiating style and er agreement these guys better than that we had both on from Mexico and Canada so I'm very proud of that for a while as anxious or initially it's ah it's good to have in the\nDepartment of agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue on the line with those um\nAny any opinion on how we got there how exactly would we ever make a deal like sunny viewers telling me something and I was telling you something or are we both had available\nOr any you told me it wasn't Joe I'll buy your stuff over to tax the two hundred Seventy percent I'd go elsewhere I Would never have taken that deal and Canada's a good friend of ours do you have any opinion as to how we got to hear what happened\nThis is what President Trump has been talking about for years they just not says he got to the president about unfair\nTrade deals actually United States has been kind of an international Patsy people have just used are consumer market did send over whatever they wanted China being the best offender but even our friends to the north and south Mexico and Canada\nHave use these free trade agreements to uh to really take advantage of our consumers where we don't have access their markets there's things exactly what President Trump has been warning us about and talking about he's at the same question\nHow could we have made these deals in the past why did we make these deals he's\nNot a Johnny come lately when it comes to understanding unfairly United States has been treated international trade\nHave you been talking about it for decades if Sonny Perdue he's the secretary of agriculture for our great land I'm All right so there's a famous picture that I've seen floating around you're wearing a hat make the our fs great again [laughter] or as bad as it used to read them all the renewable fuel standard a sunny what is that\nThis is a a program that was developed a few years ago when we were talking about\nEnergy independence for America where\nWe were just spending billions of dollars if you remember the time when we were sending billions of dollars to the Mid East for oil because we didn't have enough and really were drunk on a higher demand for oil and we weren't producing it based on the uh uh if you remember the drill baby drill\nA mantra there we've gotten out here and I understood that America is a land the great natural resources and we've got great petroleum natural gas resources we also have another\nUh good clean environmentally friendly a source and that's made
