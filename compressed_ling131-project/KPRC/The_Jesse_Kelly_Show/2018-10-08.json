{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "A than it has been before hey here's event I Want to or mentioned to you or that we're doing here on Cape your seat sort of recalling at the meeting of the minds of and it's going to be on November ... seconds is kind of like our\nOur little version of a town hall all of our local Texas talk shows all the altogether in a special room a kind of talking about a whole variety of different issues all with each other and we've all been told we can invite five listeners to come in for them to bring a guest\nIn his up to each and every one of us to decide how it is we want to give this way now I'm not sure exactly what this I Want I don't want you to have to work too hard for it\nYou know the fact that you are listening especially if you're listening at a day like today when you know we have to compete against the Astros baseball I mean you get a special war just for just for checking us out today um stop to think about this I'm a work on that this week next week we're going to need to give us away so we have ample time to notify the people who are going to be coming and um\nYou know I guess\nIf you're interested one of the things you could do would be to drop an email in my email address is Jimmy beret and I heard media dot com\nThey give me that I heard media dot com or you can also write me chubby virtual Gmail dot com either one and tell me why you'd like to come\nIt's going to be about a three hour program and again over local hosts will be on the same time including me and a kind of like a little version of a tunnel then so it'll be a very limited crowd very limited edition ground as far as how many people were going to be able to allow into this\nAll right um oh I Do need to do another reminder for the folks that view in the I. E. W. E. N. dot com or the un can build your website if you're a business person\nAnd you need a Web Web site these folks can really help you out and and they do pretty doggone good work they they built by website I Know I don't know the first thing about building a website\nCouldn't even begin to come up with any ideas for building at an effective website and that's what we're talking about here building ineffective website the Web site that's going to gather views website That's going to tell your businesses story in such a way that um\nYou know your your companies could be well represented everybody would know what your mission is they'll know exactly what it is that just that you do and how you go about doing it so let an expert put this together for you now as you probably know\nThese things can cost thousands of dollars\nBut the un and Orlando over their view it is committed to helping\nKeep your listeners especially business people come up with an effective website so he's offering you a service here where he will they will create the website for you they will help maintain the website they'll hosted on their platform and they'll do that for forty nine Ninety five a month\nThis is only for the arts the listeners so when you talk to him\nAnd he gave his name is Orlando I'll be sure to tell them you heard about it on cable or see his numbers to eight one\nTwo zero three seven five three seven that's doing one to zero three seven five three seven one more time in the number again ... to eight one two zero three seven five three seven eight explained the all the things that they do\nIt now for forty nine Ninety five a month you can maybe give you a little leg up on your competition especially if you're competition isn't smart enough to build a great website most of us aren't\nTakes a little help but not everybody can afford high priced out here's a way to get a very professional website without having to spend a ton of money in order to be able to make it happen\n[noise] All right I'm trying to think of where I Want to go with this whole thing is there anything I've I've forgotten or left out\nI'm as it relates to\nThe whole ... thing of the me too movement all the things that go along with it and the election itself I guess the one thing\nThat both sides it in ... it's kind of a as a sad state of affairs of where we're at in this country as far as what I called the great divide between Democrats and Republicans and I still think there are a lot more people stuck in the middle out there who are not very politically motivated\nIf you're listening to this program and this radio station you probably are\nMuch more than the average person would be especially in a day like today when we can all skip and a little less rose baseball\nMost people are not that motivated they're not that tuned in they don't like the fact that it's become such a divisive thing they prefer at least a few things to be done in a bipartisan way\nBut if there's one thing right now that both parties are counting on\nAnd both parties are trying to\nChannel into it would be anger\nDemocrats are trying to appeal to voters to channel their capital anger into the midterm elections and Republicans are trying to do the same thing that the difference of course is what everybody's angry about\nDemocrats are angry that he got confirms and tried to convince their supporters that this guy was the devil incarnate\nRepublicans are trying to channel into the anger that\nJust like it if you like to tweet the only person who's got access to Sarah Palin or on Twitter which is at surfing usa would be her or her family in or those who surround her and they're managing you know social media so they're not liking it but not so I'm telling you even carry him I'm like Edison her\nYeah I didn't believe that there's no way to ... am on somebody making up so that I gave sand the phone number I called in and say tell people what you said to me [noise] um I said that it was her no tell me what you said before you called\n\nYou forget I forgot what I what what did I say I'm not calling her civil like you said I'm embarrassed because it ... it could have been anybody in Alaska\nBut if it really was Sarah Palin I mean that hides Sam calling\nLike to talk to Sarah Palin so are you did eventually call we took twenty second for you to say no and he said yes and you called and now you're not talking to me at all and the radio on and talking to me for a little chat thing that we do and not getting anything from you or something like is it her and you're an audience for was yes\nSo scary that point you're still thinking it's not her on hold now even rent really Campbell\nIn that office not her yeah and I'm ... and then a same says I'm Kelly I'm pretty sure\nShe's on some guy named Todd ... her husband [laughter] so so so I said well just hang up with them and we hit a breaker we're in an interview that I taped earlier or something and I actually called the number\nAnd taught it as going back to hold him like he's doing well what is happening right now so I'm ... hold on a second he's the phone\nTo um to uh uh uh\nTo to Sarah ... Sarah said no no it's not this is not Sarah pale and now they're saying now I design I'm saying it's not ... percent or not\nAnd um and I said is that an iPhone she said the yeah they're all iPhones said can I face time you right now and they face time there and it was in fact Sarah Palin and and I showed it to you how I got into it I don't know that I told her that I was going to do so I didn't pose the picture\nAnd I'm ... and we got to talking and it was great and she says I couldn't get through the phone lines there were too busy [laughter] I'm like well it's a busy show on the phone line so yeah I mean not that I'm with you um\nSo yeah that that's that's how it all went down I was like well I only have like two minutes left in the show do you want to come on you know not only to come and you want to tell you that you've been a great point of the Ninth Circuit court of appeals hadn't or anybody else say that and and it's exactly what would happen to Murkowski's this that and the others we were talking with him over the weekend and long story short we have Sarah appeal but on the show today\nAnd a ... that'll be bottom of our number two at least seven thirty eastern time and we're to talk to each ... ... is she going to run against Murkowski you know\nI don't know are we going to find a way back to find out oh okay okay and also I wanted to compare and contrast how her family was treated in two thousand eight with how cabinets and his family had been treated in um\n... in this ridiculous last month we just had\nAnd how is it that Murkowski says she's a Republican once you've got real issues the first amendment in Second Amendment and now her excuse for why cabinet wasn't the guy was just because he's not the right guy\nAt the right time which doesn't make any sense and by the way does Lisa Murkowski get to walk away from the vote on Saturday for those of you had your heads in the sand yes he is now a Supreme Court justice at Lisa Murkowski voted no\nBut then she resented the vote did you see all that go down ... bad yeah I heard about that I mean I'm like what the ... so I'm\nVery interesting very interesting we talked about all of that and then some and are those of you who see it on television it'll be on Newsmax TV as well\nShe's like standing next to a beautiful lake in in Alaska this how ... what is going on here in hearing your claiming easing shot yeah so uh we'll have her on it's a ... nine four one Seventy four seven eight nine four one bags\nAnd it's not really about Sarah pale in the very dumb the interview and bring it to get about an hour and a half but this really is about what happened this weekend you do have a um a justice Kavanaugh\nWas it fifty one forty seven is that what it ended up being or is it fifty forty seven\nAnd believe that simply forty eight\nHundred and forty acres dangers out and yeah fifty forty eight 'cause Danes and Murkowski we're both Danes was actually at his daughter's wedding and Murkowski ended up rescinding her vote so she just votes present although the first time around she did vote no and that's important that people have all asking me to realize she did say no\nTo justice cabin on she never give a good reason why then the idiots tried to protest and then who were scratching at the Supreme Court door which made no sense I mean the whole thing has just been dumb I'm\nThat will the Democrats now take a breath and back off or are they going to um to continue this ridiculous outrage for no reason it eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com stay right

for taking my ... family well your ... um I'm calling regarding the potential Kavanaugh peach an issue you know\nI thought that one could only be impeached ... committed while actually and how can the Democrats even attempt to impeach Kavanaugh for something here ... good\nI'm not even yet serving on the court\nThe only thing that they have to anger hats on his age he's already\nBeen on the court has been in the federal federal court so it was already a government employee they might be able to say well he was already a federal judge when he testified and they're claiming that he committed perjury they're claiming that he lied under oath about his activities in high school or something of course they have nothing to corroborate that but I\nThink those are the grounds they would try to ... they would try to bring I think they would try to say\nThat he lied under oath well testifying in front of the panel\nThey're very than ground\nOh there is no grounds at all I don't think that it would go anywhere with the fact that they're even suggesting it tells me that the voters would be voters are smart enough to notice the voters should probably say yeah no that's not going to happen Carlos that ought to keep you holding I only have about thirty seconds and make it up and\nI'm at I'm just saying ah he went into a moderate to begin with but after\nThis I think it's going to sway 'em I Know that he's a judge and he usually goes by the lot while they do go to the weather there was a law that there's going to sway whatever including his feelings out certain subjects them to just straight right because he knows what they're capable of\nWhy they're going right I think that they probably did Bush or more and we we love and Carlos calls in from El Paso I'm I I think he's I think he's a hundred percent right I think that this judge now will say look worse I was going to be even more open minded hitting this court 'cause he's not as far right as Gorsuch or Scalia\nThis might tell him wow look at what left politics in this country really do let me focus exactly word for word on the lake but some of the constitution\nI got to do a quick break your we come back is gonna be

so on\nStudies have been done by anthropologists over the years but actually show that these so called indigenous people\nHave a lot of their heritage based in Europe oh that's right I mean at some point millennia ago they traveled across the Bering Strait big trouble all the way through Alaska down through Canada and ended up coming years so now that I guess populating Mexico and so on\nWe can't truly talk about history we have to pretend we know something about history and if we get rid of Columbus Day because Christopher Columbus was not\nWas not a a Spaniard he was a Taliban and Italians or the evil white man especially if you're a northerner telling and I'm not sure where Christopher Columbus came from but he's a tell you although you was commissioned by um the queen of Spain\nTherefore you can call the bad guy if you were from Spain I'm guessing you couldn't call a bad guy because that he would be Hispanic or Latino or that you have to get my past because that's other than white that's really what we're doing we're so Columbus ohio many would say is named after I don't know who carry\nChristopher Columbus I understand you've below some something on Columbus ohio when you're doing it\nIs an editor of fat from Fox to Columbus ohio the mid western American city named after Christopher Columbus is not celebrating the famed explores a federally recognized holiday and one stat honored military veterans in his place\nAnd said he observed Columbus St probably for as long as it had been in existence a spokesman for mayor angel ... said the share of the capital cities opposites will remain open ended stay close on veterans' day which on on November twelfth\nThe mayor's office of the decision was made because many of US cities are placing their observance of Columbus Day in the room indigenous people's day rather because the city doesn't have the budget to get an eighty five hundred employees off on both that and Veterans Day\nAnd the number of veterans who worked for the city and there are so many here in Columbus Day that said I thought it was important to honor them with that thing off and the celebration of Columbus Day held on the second Monday of every October has become growing link contested in recent years\nBut more U.S cities choosing to honor the nation's indigenous people with their own day which has been recognized by the United nations since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd explore history has been divisive missing historians claim Columbus committed atrocities against the Native Americans he encountered if he came to America\nParents met the director of the Native American Indian center in central Ohio and the city's moved cannot celebrate Columbus Day is a victory for everyone the past is the past it may not be pretty at times but we cannot hold what happened back then again today's society regardless of their bloodline said\nAnd in fact the city in Columbus is taking action as a victory for everyone but just to continue now an organizer of the city's thirty nine you're Columbus Italian festival which is typically held on come on this day weekend\nBlamed the move on what he said is a politically correct culture it's very en vogue politically right now to do that and it's not PC for me to say anything against indigenous peoples he said you can kick Christians you can kick Catholics and that's the message that sense to us and that's what it feels like we're Europeans and we love Indians heads off which is just not true\nYeah you know and and he's right about that\nAnd what are they going to be you'd have to think the next step is changing the name ... be hurt your herd dumb moves or drives or push is in the state of Texas to change the name of Austin the capital\nOf how you can't go to Austin because the guy I was there was no good or bad SOB oh you haven't used the you gotta change that one to me what are you going in Texas for chaos is having trouble do I mean it's a Spanish word can we can use Spanish words in the\nSan Antonio is named after seeing anybody so in other words you can't name something up for a saint which we just call it Antonio shall we just go insane to we just call it ...\nI mean I I don't I don't I don't know what we're supposed to do any more but the next logical step would be instead of Columbus ohio we would named indigenous peoples Ohio when we\nAre going to go you know get that big conference coming up an indigenous peoples Ohio now so we're going to do is that is that where we're headed or maybe can we use some common sense and say without Columbus in that journey and\nYou don't know and I don't know and nobody living today has any clue whether he was a horrible guy or whether he was a great guy that was attacked by the so called indigenous peoples events fought back we don't know anything\nWe do know though in fourteen Ninety to the world was being conquered by the stronger of the of the the combatants\nThat's the way it worked in that day and age that's the way things went down it wasn't the modern day where you could tell somebody off on Twitter so Columbus coming here just stand back from it overall a good thing\nOr a bad thing I'm going to go with I'm gonna do a good thing I'm going to my vote a good thing\nBecause if you look around at the great world we have and how civilized the first world is we're pushing the third world to catch up\nAnd and how how much we've achieved as a race the human race\nWe I think I Would have to think discovering or rediscovering or landing on the new land um was a good thing and by\nThe way there are American Indians that still exist today and why don't we go on and on and on about how horrible the aspects were the minds were in Mexico what why don't we do that\nWhat are we talking about how horrible Spain was for conquering Mexico that's why they speak Spanish there why is it always let's find the nearest white guy and blame him for the horrible atrocities in our history everybody else has ever done anything that there was a little bit darker than Casper they're okay\nWith the white guy is in big trouble because he's well I\nIt just dumb it doesn't make any sense to me so I'll take calls on that certainly I've got a guy boat John is on line one John stay there all get to you after the break who is going to tell me how the media doesn't and I don't understand the beach Mitt\nWere all wrong about it but John those the interest of will take him in a in a moment it's I'm editing nine for one pack eight eight nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe packs dot coms that writer\n[noise] barely off\n[noise] [noise]\nYou shouldn't sounds good everywhere Alexa placate PR see on ... radio\n\nThe Brett Kavanaugh matter I think this case proves the media is out of control it used to be a man was innocent until proven guilty but if you watch MSNBC and CNN they see it the other way\nIf you're a conservative like Brett Kavanaugh is well you're guilty there is an answer better media honest media there is a channel I've been watching and that I'm On Monday through friday it's called Newsmax TV and its America's real conservative news channel I like it\nYou should check out Newsmax TV as well you get great desk people like Bill O'Reilly Mike Reagan Pat Buchanan so many others you can find Newsmax TV right now on direct TV channel three forty nine dish to sixteen Uber's twelve twenty and file six Fifteen\nThat's direct TV channel three forty nine dish to sixteen Uber's twelve twenty and files six Fifteen I Love being on Newsmax TV every day and I love watching it when I'm not on and remember to go to your smartphone store downloaded free Newsmax TV ads\nAnd watch them anytime anywhere in the world Newsmax TV is real news for real people like you and me\nIf you like my family you've got a ton of videotapes I mean VHS she might have film even photos laying around you haven't looked at them in years\nCorrect ... um the charges are trees bribery or other I ...\nWhich is kind of weird to to describe a high crime and misdemeanor I think that I'd be the house of represented the Democrats think they've got Trump on the structure of justice because of what he allegedly said the call me which again there's nothing there and on on Kavanaugh I have no idea what they think they have other than potentially perjury\nUm in his testimony which can't be proven because I don't know how you go back to Nineteen eighty one to find out who's telling the truth or not\nOkay to really get a pass on this is what I Do I I I don't know don't don't do so you know it's it's ... it's actually understandable\nWhy you would assume that everybody in the media is doing the same thing because the vast majority of Americans John ... and it's what you called in basic when you say impeached means removed\nAnd it doesn't mean that at all it's just it's just started the process in the house that ends up in the Senate and it's very very hard to teach somebody and if the Republicans still have a majority in the Senate and they probably will after November it's going to go nowhere\nBut I'm not really sure why the Democrats think running on metal let me ask you this could you sound like a smart dude and I think you probably have a good answer to this do you think the Democrats are running on impeachment because most people think it means remove\nWell yes I Do I think the I think the Democrats do because I don't think they're smart enough to read history books or Google or the beach\nBut probably true ah I just simple to Google to get it and they just haven't done it\nRight but uh and and this gives or\nForce for the the the the Republicans to go out there and really fire up the vote\nSo we make sure that we have the majority of the house of representatives and we have a majority ...\nSo you know this this hopefully will light a fire under Paul Ryan's Mitch McConnell and the few other butts out there to go out there it's dark you pay for the the the Republicans that are running for office\nJohn I hear you and I appreciate your brother that I Do appreciate you wanted to educate but but you know I'm a little sensitive like that I tried to make sure that I'm right but more remote anything that's going to say I'm wrong make sure that usually only writer\nBacking up mhm\nExactly ... days it's been a bit hard art or John we appreciate your age eight eight eight nine ... editing nine for one Seventy two four seven oh they still they still do the dog and pony show in Washington\nI really do not know I have a TV right now so I\nMet face these students don't have a TV all the Roma ... logo was on the TV allow yeah I'm like wait a minute we're at which is exactly how would you be wouldn't be getting rid of that I get to them all those things for you and these were both all we know\nThat I'm just kidding it's often rude Rubio\nEdited nine for one pack Joe ... dot com let's go to um jak in Boston jak what's on your mind high\nEthics that's taking my call I appreciate it you know I Want to say is that good it could be an American I was very ... said I only a judge Kavanaugh yet a strong but also want any and democracy it alive and well I Would also make it for ... yeah\nIt's all the candidates will maintain a majority in the Senate and they will maintain a majority now says well\nI think the house is going to be harder or jak but I mean I just got to lose three or four weeks of cabinet ... I think that a lot of Republicans are going to be motivated to go and vote\nI Hope they don't forget I have a very short memory\nOr whether you're no Jack Jack I've read that you think you were living on the Boston which is interesting\nIs I think he's right it's almost unfortunate that this all went down\nA month before the election you know what I mean if it goes down two days before the election everybody's going to go and go through this am I going to be able to get left right middle wherever the hell you are going to go vote because it just wasn't right which is went down\nIt just wasn't right but now that it's a month out and and again\nLook I'm not going to give the Democrat talking points I might look they want to do what they're doing because really do but I mean they have a month now to fix all of what they just harm and they just did a lot of harm to this country to our system we they ... they would generally said\nThey literally said it doesn't matter at this point if he's innocent or guilty\nAbout that\nSpartacus actually said due process does it matter period and the story of a nice day\nEight nine four one bags Joe ... we go back\nIt's going to be um former governor of the great state of Alaska former vice presidential nominee for the United states of America she was on the ticket was John McCain Sarah Palin listens to this program ah every day as you drop the kids off at school or picking them up\nAnd and we really are we enjoyed climbing up and she likes the show on friday and I enjoyed even more having a conversation with a not very long ago you're going to see it on television you're gonna hear it on radio and uh yes I Do ask her very directly are you planning on taking a Lisa Murkowski\nIt twenty twenty two for the Senate seat that she now holds\nHer answers are very interesting I mean the ... and again she's awesome and the scenery behind her I gotta get up to target to get to Alaska\n... bringing it back after this [noise]\n\nVideo by me\nWhile I tried to verify the few ways when I got the email back from Sarah blooming dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I said do you have an iPhone ... face time you unless you settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got it together thank you so much for reaching out by the way\nThat and that's about it and then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd Stone [laughter] by that time out of the vehicle and we're all press the button to try to figure out how to say that\nAnd it worked out 'cause you brush the but you took my face time in ... her Latino say that's her that's\n... ... and now you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became the senator\nAs a write in really so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican I Can't support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right\nGuy at the right time did the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNow and go back even further\nWriting campaign ad after he lost the primary up here we never once heard Senator Frank Murkowski after having served twenty two years in the U.S and he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on time and then I ran against him into a heated you haven't read that at least got and that's how we had stayed in essentially 'cause man once you're in and you have these special interests from around the country right a funding you you know you shouldn't have to it\nIt's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough\nTime to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that that vote against cabinet because as you point out she said he good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know about cause like of course it is and whether either good manners yes\nI'm no no it didn't make sense in in her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because as you suggested as an outright set on friday\nSaid she's pretty in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska yeah [laughter] this country I mean it comes down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you bet you that you liked was about the Ninth Circuit court of appeals that I'll I'll repeat that in the second ... syrup hail and of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all run person I Am sure you know this\nI wasn't a vote for John McCain has been right in my mother's name until you got on the ticket\nAnd then I voted for you show and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court for the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um the more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast\nIn other words if the Supreme Court is eight members that it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment check amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment tenth amendment for Alaska where does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that they're they're um what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the night circuits had she had her her way and that's the night circuits out of\nSan Francisco right he talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jesse Kelly Show", "city":
