I don't you know open seasonal time you know July tends to be that bad but July this year right was actually very very good yeah um but we do have historically could be September and October\nSome of the worst months for volatility or in markets okay we'll usually have above average volatility\nIn October or it's just something that you know again I don't know the full answer as to why but that is just something that happened um you know and so\nBy around November December those should be more better month so it's going to be very important to see what ... says in his statement for December it's going to be very very important for companies that are reporting and we're going to be about\nErnie seasoned very soon the companies that are the leaders of the economy the ones that are cyclical the ones that\nYou packaging and paint and ... and industrial equipment it's\nGoing to be very important to hear what they are saying\nAbout what we called forward guides are they giving us saying hey we're doing doing okay a lot of the leaders of the market in that space has been telling us that their prices are going up\nTheir guidance is getting softer these are all this is a combination that to the rising interest rates with just really I ate trigger\nBut there's been more behind the more than just the rise in interest rate combination of factors including why brought up housing and also the fact that some of the leaders in the cyclical space the ones that you really want to see out there doing well are not giving the most impressive hey things are getting better\nIt's just an owner what getting pressured by rising labor costs oh no we're getting pressured by pricing cook own knowledge faster than we thought these are the things that the markets now taking into consideration\nAnd we're not getting much guidance from the fed as to\nWhat they're thinking as opposed to are they looking to be more accommodating ... or they just going to steam or on the head and the markets perception is Powell is not their friend and he's going to steam or ... head\nWhat is increasing rates and I think you've got an inkling of that from President Trump pride in his own\nYou know you got real happy with them right now\nRight so I'm Wondering how that tends to escalate as this continues right now it's just they pulled back and correction and I would say it's helped me the market has been an excessive if there's been some excess\nIn the market just rains it out if you're a buyer for the long term you've got twenty got Thirty years and you're slowly putting money into the market you're buying lower not only that and they think about how many people have a hundred percent of their portfolio money in stocks and bonds you have cash\nAnd even though bonds are not doing great they are holding up okay so you want to be sort of balance in your coach you don't want to be aggressive here\nRight and of course depending on how close you are to retirement that's going to determine what you need to do with things like\nStabbed so lately now\nI realize I'm I'm I'm asking a generic question and I know you don't want to give me a specific financial advice and I'm not I don't want to ask you to give these specific financial advice but category was\nUm you see when you see this kind of stuff going on when he when he looks like we're returning to volatility if you will the very least it looks like I mean we've got so used to things being so studies so calm for so long that when you see any kind of wild swings up or down even what the heck's going on\nWhere for for those who are safety concern but they still want to stay in the stock market what areas do you tell them to look at is is receiver into the stock market to be all kinds of\nWell it's all fair and I didn't interview about this not too long ago when I thought rates are going to go higher in what areas might be what would be considered even though all stocks get hurt in a down fly there are some stuff that might fall off a cliff and there's some stocks that just ... hill or the more defensive\nStocks think of um food and beverage you're always going to eat right in the average utilities are taught telecommunications anything at non what we call non cyclical business which means that hey you eat this stuff no matter what\nYou need just stuck to survive every day\nSo why in just like in ... should I invested Popeye's fried chicken [laughter] yeah I might\nGo like in McDonalds Wal Mart folks\nAre high and a lot of our lives but they don't like they were\nTo stocks Jimmy that through the financial crisis and do this twenty eight years to stock that actually close positive through the financial crisis you know there were no or the McDonalds and Wal Mart\nWell that makes sense [laughter] but at the ... the ... that makes sense\nI mean are they used to say what was it also used to say about General Motors as General Motors goes so goes the nation that's kind of Walmart is kind of the barometer now isn't it\nAbsolutely is and again even Walmart is coming out and they've done some wonderful things as far as getting online and try to do their best to compete with out of our but they are being pressured by higher unit labor costs so this is the real conundrum and confusion of markets wait a minute\nAre going to be making more money they're getting paid more but the market hate chick wealthy coffee creates inflation if it right if interest rates to go higher and it costs to had to move to kick that break so it's really strange sometimes what's good for main streets not good for Wall Street and let me ask you a question I\nThink about it this way if the ten year treasury\nGoes to normal then maybe normal around four and a half to five percent and you're able to get the money or buy a bond for for like ... what what do you think's going to happen\nWith older investor getting close to retirement the lady they'll pull somebody out of stock and you know to save money\nThat would make sense that we might be that the stock market without\nThat's right and and then in the face of the ... just because that was the only place to really be making

A. and when we were ... with ... he got he teamed up with Bob but it but I Want to stop you for a second because this is important did you when Kanye West George Bush doesn't like black\nPeople in response to Katrina and the country in response to where you vocal do you call my show and say I disagree with Kanye or did you did you stay quiet and just accept it\nI won't say has stayed quiet I don't think that it came to my mind just because I think you might have confidence subject and I might not have all the radio stay really but I mean yeah I think it was one of those things but if I heard you speak on it I would've Pocono trial\nHow about when he went up and he took the microphone at a Taylor Swift hand and he was obviously ... did you call in and complain about that\nNo I didn't ... that was more political that was more at the\nHome yeah my mom today Tracy you couldn't you couldn't wait to get through and say the Kanye West is doing something wrong why why today one on one other times\nWhat I Know that part of it the real thing I was calling for it because I felt kind of what is really making\nA mess that set themselves how ... just like you did on Saturday Night live and I think he he's I think it really does have an issue with mental health\nA Middle East says he does having anything he says that he was diagnosed as bipolar but then he's not so sure ah the bottom line is there may be a mental issue there having said that what specifically did he said today with what you disagree\n[noise] I think this way if he did say it I mean I yeah he did speak about what ... yeah and he played ... they don't feel that Trump is bringing jobs back years and\nThat's debatable but I'm not going to go\nI didn't no no no it's really it's really not debatable that's a fact but but good let's just states that concussion yet because you called in and told my daughter who screened the goals that that he's an embarrassment to African Americans so what exactly the same day that embarrassed you\nWell first and foremost I was taught in schools is very professional\nRank you notice is she doing a great job today about progress\nI'm like I ... I just you know his he was ... it was incoherent\nUm you know he's proud that we didn't make America great again that's all fine I I really have to say it was all on its own that what you said yes the what he was saying is true I'm not going to say it is or not\nAnd what he was saying too I Would want the same things but the inner cities in Chicago I think it's getting out of ... right I Do think that that needs how so I'm not going to argue so much the conscience how he said it hurts\nSo how did you how did you how did you need him say without how did you need to know is that guy district in your\nEars are confused about for eleven years now you and I've been radio friends and for eleven years I've been trying to say because I think that you're a smart dude I Know that you're a small business owner and you've got the greatest here I've ever seen on a guy having said all of that the bottom line is this\nI just want to get through a little bit and find out what the issue is 'cause I think the unique jerk react to today because you don't like the Kanye West is supporting a president that you don't like if you take away everything that was surrounding him and you listen to him say\nI Want jobs and not prison cells I Want fathers to be in homes because they're good guys for their sons I Want Americans to make the goods and not have the made in China yes that he said he puts on the American men make America great again hat he feels like Superman you can disagree with that if you want but about getting jobs in the inner city and making Chicago\nBut he can be committed that it should be that's all good you should agree with him\nI Do but my issue is I cook is the host spectacle and when I once I heard him say he studies and profoundly I once I saw the circus added to one side or the president of the plane that went by now ... and in this room in the state that is\nSo he should not have had ... floors in disarray\nNo no no it's not that I don't\nIt's just it's just the whole scene relate to me and me and my small limit itself but made the white\nHouse ... years long limited at all but but I Do find that interesting that you think it's okay for athletes to make a spectacle out of themselves by kneeling on the sidelines during the national anthem but you have a problem with ... in one room the oval office making a speech that's weird to me\nWell no I think that's where we're from on ...\nHow do we differ without the are they not that you are they not make us back to ...\nOut of themselves and the needle for the national of course they are doing it for the cameras and doing all the fans are doing it for the notoriety\nLet me let me put\nIt because they can go and hotels down at city hall if they want they could protest at the White House they're not they're protesting a football field\nSame ... ...\n... no Joe because to me as an African American loan I watch witness over the years how after this happened getting shot by cops and these are people who are in a position to catch him and they're finally\nNearly and the problem is that really gets me is that how we're redefining\nThanks for instance I don't know where we're not redefining undergoes Kanye West wants fewer people to die at the hands of a gun in Chicago there black people killing black people there every day and you know that one so that he wants that\nBut he's speaking out against that he's a spectacle you got football players that are taking two or three cases that they can think of off the top of their heads and they're saying all cops want\nTo kill black people that's my problem that is a spectacle and they're coming from a lack of knowledge ... Tanya is coming from a place of knowledge Chicago is in dire is in dire straits Chicago needs help and this president says is going to bring jobs back to my city I'm Down I'm with them\nYeah but this is where it's going to have the issue of do you want to\nCry that of course the respect and that you're that well one of a football game of tactical\nRight let me ask you this is not the spectacle block president to have on American soil Russia's come over here to attack in America whether you like they've got\nAll right I I I've no idea what you're like well now now you're talking about Russians attacking American or a trace it you want to jump the shark ... love your like crazy look love you is if we were were brothers from another mother but how you got to Russia and Britain how the president wants people to come here to do something that's completely off the ship\nOff the reservation and your jumped the shark I made a direct comparison spectacle the spectacle or you want to bring in Russia collusion which has been proven to not exist but a little bit like a brother will talk again quick break here we come back to find out the differences in Medicare and Medicaid end in Obamacare regular Joe patch upstairs\n\nThe best probably yeah\n\n\n\n\nSounds good everywhere okay Google played it could be or see on a hard radio\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like use so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone\nElse you'll asleep built this lead quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the answers to match your body type and sleep references to

orders get up to a hundred and twenty five dollars off at Hewlett sleep dot com slash pegs\nThan a better question is usually really doing\nAll the president's been very very clear from the beginning that he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions while he's been clear about that the secretary of health Alex ... and clear and I'm clear about that as well we will do everything that we can to make sure that people with preexisting conditions have the protections that they need and deserve\nOkay again for those who can't you're the president is doing all the ... and the people working on those are they're doing all they can to keep reducing or conditions covered the president said it again very directly yesterday I'm not trying to get rid of preexisting conditions those were saying that I Am or making that up and I guess they're pointing to something about\n... ... well I guess they're not putting anything it's just it's just Felicia's as it is is is rooted in foods at all has the president ever said hey we should probably look again I'm going to pre existing snow yet\nNow I think he's always been consistent that he supports protections for people with preexisting conditions I think the reality is our critics it and making all kinds of productions they've been saying that the actions that the president's been taking is going to make things worse that it's going to increase\nThe cost of health insurance and we're seeing from today's results of that is simply not true that we're actually seeing decreases one of the great things that the president did was he got rid of the individual mandate you and you know that was the penalty\nFor people that couldn't afford health insurance in fact most of the people that were getting penalize or paying penalties eighty percent of those people were earning less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nAnd the president got rid of that and so you know that show that he's very concerned about people that you know have they're facing challenges with all this on affordable coverage that demonstrates his commitment to providing choice and lower cost individual\nThat's absolutely but ignored that that find that penalty that touch and John Roberts or none of them so the fundamental due to touch so it's a load of that tax was was\nAn orderly affecting people who are in the middle class and those people basically got their tax break through the tax cuts that their their bonuses from their jobs their increases in pay and they stopped being taxed unduly for something they didn't want to purchase the image never talked about in the media is\nThat's right I mean in fact what we are hearing is that there were these dire predictions if the president got rid of the individual mandate if the president changed the regulations\nOn you know the president allow short term limited duration plans to get more affordable coverage to people that if we did those things\nPremiums would increase and I think the evidence shows today that that has not happened and in fact the reverse it happened you're actually saying lower premiums you know in the state of Tennessee premiums are going to go down twenty six percent\nThat we haven't seen that since Obamacare started\nYeah that's amazing a it is against the move or widowed follow her it's as easy a lesson to be or I may to use the uh the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid services um one last thing that I've only got a a quick second here there's no way we could ever afford Medicare parole could we the three ... dog will be socialist you're talking about\nNow Medicare for all basically Medicare for non this would hurt seniors and it would sort of redirect the focus on the program elsewhere thirty two trillion dollars we can't afford it and it would hurt seniors\nOr she was saying should believe recall it into the great information and great job and that was supposed to get into All right thank you\nWe appreciate achievable machines the administrator for Medicare and Medicaid services\nWith the Trump Administration some incredible information so the prices are starting to come down a little bit because we're expanding competition you remember then President Obama said that the average family which saved twenty five hundred a year they actually showed increased above five thousand a year in their premiums and a lot of people were taxed or find a because they couldn't afford it or health care so\nThis is another positive step by the Trump Administration your thoughts on that\nCould be the one calling you we come back eighty nine four one passage supervisor\nSaid you\nTo\n\n\nGo and and ... actually ... ...\nOkay cool um yeah there's there's a lot going on and and I wonder I was so to start this went hope this is okay but I Wonder\nAs you're on campus and as you're walking around seeing this cabinet stuff go on in Washington DC just give me an overview is just about everybody except you some liberal indicated nut job and they're all like freaking out but he's going to take away rights and diversity and end abortion and everything\nI mean it can be quite honest than a definitely all their

a lot a right wing group act in a long time then\nEven then I'm actually shown to work out in\n... which amazing to me is that those who weren't supporting those who are protesting when you talk to them about what the problem was they didn't really know are you finding that a lot of your contemporaries don't know why they're protesting were complaining but they know that it feels like the right thing to do because so many more people like that we're doing it\nUm I I um I think a lot of people well in media\nOn that river by and especially at you know I mean ... ... is dying on college
