{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Because Twitter has to hate speech policy and they enforce it against conservatives all the time\nHere is what Twitter says about hate speech disorder\nRules out what amounts to what the company calls\nAbusive behavior direct or indirect violent threats a I think threatening to stab somebody in the throat or the face or to kill somebody would be considered a\nViolent threat it is pretty direct there's no indirect there or threats to promote violence or terrorism\nWell there's a threat there for violence targeted abuse or harassment of others yeah I think we know that targets the person in the United states directed right in him\nHateful conduct such as attacking or threatening seven on the basis of race wells 'cause he's white ethnic diversity\nIs he's Anglo national origin because he's proud to be an American sexual orientation 'cause he's a heterosexual gender used to do gender identity used to do religious affiliation\n... sometimes I think it's if you have a religion in any way shape or form that your target age he's old disability little crazy sometimes or disease I'm not going to go there\nSo\nYou're not supposed to do that through the OJ trial it's a violation of soldiers on hate speech policy so what are the consequences of posting content that amounts to abusive behavior not following the rules set by Twitter can lead\nOr it doesn't say will lead I'll grant them that says can lead depending upon the severity of the violation well maybe that's the problem maybe they'll consider threatening the life of the price of the United states to be you know all that serious violation\nBut if they weren't they consider that the results would\nBe a temporary locking of your account until the abusive content is removed or a permanent suspension of the users account which is usually enforced where user has been reporting for multiple instances of abusing the rules\nSo I guess I should assume that these people are all guilty of the first time a fence okay I'll I'll leave it I'll even grant them that that that's a stretch but I'll grant them that if that's the case then why is that stuff's still up there\nWas their accounts supposed to be suspended until the abusive caused him just remove\nWouldn't you think that many F words would trigger off one of the algorithms that Twitter for somebody to take a look at it okay let's see what this person saying and by the way I don't know I'm not a big censorship got a guy I'm just a let's enforce the rules look all the same for everybody\nKind of guy which means if you make a threat against somebody you should be treated the same way as that somebody who's making a threat against Donald Trump so if there is no punishment for threatening Donald Trump the\nPrice of the United states because he's Donald Trump then why should you be punished for your abusive behavior either but chances are you will be\nIf you're a conservative\nAnd that's why the rules don't mean anything and that's why people not only are not following the rules of abusive behavior they are engaging in it\nThey're engaging in it because they're frustrated and they're angry and what we're finding out are starting to find out and will continue to find out is that people on the writer ... going to end up being just as angry as people on the left\nNow if you missed the opening monologue that are programs that I talked a little bit about some of the uh the Hollywood actors\nJames Cromwell the guy was in ... that the big movie\nHe was the warden in the green mile I think it's been a warden in couple of things\nWasn't even warden in that uh Adam Sandler remake of a with this what's the yeah the longest yard yeah he was and that one too that we got a typecast this guy is a is a warden turns out he's a crazy liberal who's\nSaying that if Democrats don't regained control there's going to be a bloody revolution calling for violence\nIs um it's a crazy crazy crazy\nTime that we live in the difference the difference is Christmas where Meyer says which side as the guns in a while I Know most of us will be able to defend yourself if it comes to that\nUm but I I I've said this before forgive me for saying this again I I really do believe that too we live in the most volatile time since the American civil war the difference between now and then is the technology that exists back then all you had\nWere single fire rifles for the most part\nCannon you fought on horseback and the\nThe swift this form of transportation was the train\nThis is an entirely different world that we live in now you can't fight that kind of war anymore you certainly can't fight the United states military as it relates to something along those lines assuming the United states military spending aside and all this\nBut the divide is is never been greater in my opinion and growing more and more day by day so\n[noise] if if we're gonna rashes this thing down we all have to ratchet down the president tried\nHe gave the media and opening but\nThe media's just doubled tripled and quadrupled down on it so the threats of violence continued from the left the attacks continue from the left\nWe are setting all kinds of records especially here in Texas for early voting I'm I Am beyond curious to see how this whole election thing turns out already already got my vote in on Sunday early voting on Sunday\nWhat a concept able to go over the weekend to vote did you see how many people voted in Harris County on Saturday it was just shy of eating the house and that's amazing\nI think it is a record I I Know that we've already set or we are well past normal presidential election years as far as early voting we'll\nSee what the turnout a is a morning show in theory\nThey were making predictions that some Seventy six percent of Texas say they cannot wait to vote doesn't mean that they're all going to vote in fact I doubt I'm Seventy six percent would but wouldn't that be amazing if they did\nThat would be maybe the one bright spot to come out of all this stuff is the fact that people are getting re engage [noise] I'd have yourself a great day tomorrow morning burden early five amateur fire on ... you just want to use it back here tomorrow three SAP RC [laughter]\nOr seen from the gallery furniture made in America studios this is Katie are seeing signs that said\n[noise]\nOn Iran's event can signed ... Fox News President Trump and the first lady in Pittsburgh and pay respects did that was lost in the mass shooting and it's been a guy toxic ... Scott has more line\nLisa the president's first stop was the tree of life synagogue where a lab and people were shot dead Saturday tributes included a candle lighting and placing stones from the White House and\nThe or the Democrat ... wants to raise taxes and all sorts of dastardly stuffed in Michigan so Michigan make sure you stick around we'll have a a bill shooting on this very program we've also got um a representative from the department of homeland security kitty Waldman she's going to talk about what the DA chess is doing\nWhat it comes to the caravan I'm going to talk about um what exactly these troops these National Guard and other troops would do on the border and who is it that in this caravan who is it that we have down there we talked to her about that she's from the administrators of course\nIs that for you which is nice and then we also have to do is jam packed Ted Cruz calling in bottled the second hour oh call in live like Ted Cruz a job or not playing around\nYou is what I'm Sorry today then yeah you guys had\nNews calling in and we try to get my hair cut and it's easier to go in and get it done and then I also got him John graves you know John graves is\nI don't think that I got a tip\nUm flyers that were being handed out at places of worship informational flyers about what the candidates believe on issues that are important to those who who believe in fate and on this wire you had to call on this one was Ted Cruz when was that the O'Rourke\nAnd it went down the list about abortion about taxes about the border and so on and he told the truth well somebody got a hold of these wires right mhm\nRead did them exactly the same way including was vision America dot org which is the organization that may be original wires they read did them completely and they just made a crap about about crews and about ... suggesting that Iraq was the right choice and Cruz was not if you're somebody who believes in faith\nI mean banning left the same website on there and everything you imagine a joke packs dot com flyer and somebody just changes everything on it but still director to my website ... that would be nuts and they actually copied it\nExactly I mean the wire looks like the original flyer which I Believe has to be some sort of fraud I mean they're suing and everything else but I Want to make sure that people listening in watching understand that\nThey might be getting false information when they get these these ah informational things so we'll talk to him I'm coming up at the bottom of our number three I Believe I'm trying to figure out we're going to play around you know what I'll do it now bringing him I'll bring him at the top of next hour\nOf cruised the bottom next hour\nWill do kitty walled in this hour\nBeatrice and bill shooting will be our number three heavily do\nWell okay sure down good me ask you something what are you going to do [noise] I Am I doing a lot of stuff over here and um I Do I ... a lot of ... a lot of new stuff the stuff I Am the anger at when I Do and that's when I'll be\nDoing when you plant in Helmand in the morning getting that done now and again and money I've held up and I think I can add up all love that by the way that I absolutely love that\nAnd it's the craziest thing go we've got a lot going on lots to get to him to last me want to talk about so let's start out with um [noise]\nLet's go caravan because that's going to work very well into my interview with the bottom but it's also going to work very well and to get into the into this issue of the fourteenth amendment I Want to explain the fourteenth amendment give you my take on the fourteenth amendment\nAnd whether I think the president is righteous you talking about possibly doing an executive order to change the birthright clause in the fourteenth amendment so if you can give us the latest on what's happening with the care of him\nAnd this is the most recent thing I found it to the independent around four thousand migrants from Central America or walking in hitchhiking northward through Mexico and Donald Trump and dispatched five thousand troops southward to help secure the U.S border and then when his term and emergency in addition to the original grew more than a thousand migrants in a second Karen and enforce it the way across the river from Guatemala\nAnd begin to writing in southern Mexico City of ...\nAnd that's the latest strained status quo and the side of the migrant care of them which channel ten thousand strong manure is two weeks ago on the way the caravans been joined by people from El Salvador Guatemala speaking to enter the U.S at the same time thousands of dropped out because of the heat and exhaustion ending offer transport home mind the Mexican government\nThat you're comes made clear he will do everything in its power to stop them dispatching extra troops studying to shut the border down entirely and telling them on social media\nTo go home\nAll right so that's the leaders of the caravan and now we get what was it actually uses what who we sat down and out of your interview with actually ... them All right so the president says down with this ... outlet\nAnd in that interview he talks about how he's considering\nThrough executive order and making a change to the fourteenth amendment or you know bypassing the clause and the fourteenth amendment I'm that gives you citizenship if you're born here have you got something on that\nI certainly do get on there okay and now this is from ... our\nPresident Donald Trump says he will seek to end the right of citizenship to children born in the United states to non citizens and illegal immigrants in his latest bed to dramatically reshape immigration policies as he thinks to shore up Republicans had him next week congressional elections trumpet target the citizenship right through an executive order until ...\nIn an interview published on Tuesday and that would prompt a legal fight the right of US citizenship is granted to U.S born children under the fourteenth amendment of the constitution which cannot be changed by the president\nAnd it was unclear what specific action has order would pursue and from gave no details representatives of the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment\nAnd blatantly unconstitutional Omar John ... head of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project told Reuters the president obviously economic return the constitution by executive order the notion that he would even try as absurd changing in a minute and the constitution would require and it's important to two thirds of the U.S house of representatives and the Senate\nAnd the backing of three fourths to the U.S state legislatures any constitutional convention\nAnd the Trump said he has talked to legal counsel with his eyes he could enact the change on his own\nAsked about the dispute over such presidential powers Trump said he stood by his comments it's in the prompt that it'll happen he acts the U.S in the interview which will air and full on the HBO pay cable channel on Sunday\nSome conservatives have long pushed for an end to guarantee a birthright citizenship that view Trump echoed it's ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to end until next year\nAnd Trump is hard line immigration stance helped him win the White House has seized on the issue in recent weeks in the run up to November sixth vote\nThat has American sharply divided in grappling with the race and national identity\nAlright so Ken the president changed the fourteenth amendment\nIt's a it's a pretty complicated get very easy question the answer is I Would think no no if the president believes that there is some inherent danger to the American people can do an executive order to at least temporarily stop it\nI Would still think probably not but I'm not really sure\nSo when we come back home and take your phone calls and I wonder if you would be for a changing of the fourteenth amendment Rubik absolute normal process where the states to ratify and so on um to get rid of that birthright will get into why the birthright assume there I'll get into exactly what the fourteenth amendment says there are some of your confused about the\nUh subject to the jurisdiction narrow whereas you think that already says that the baby was born here or not citizens because the parents aren't I disagree with you and we'll talk about that too it nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy four seven Joe ... dot coms that writer\n[noise] show fall\n\n\nThere is nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone\nElse you'll asleep built asleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete and they use the interests of match your body type and sleep references to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleeper like a plush or from bed which he looks there's no more guessing or confusion just go to sleep dot com slash bags\nIf the person is born that person who's been subject to the jurisdiction there of why wouldn't the person be you are subject to the laws and regulations and rules and and and so on where you're born\nSo the argument that well the parents aren't subject to the jurisdiction there over there for the kid is in in what world I don't know where you guys got that now I Am I Am for changing the fourteenth amendment\nTo say somebody coming across the border illegally for the sole purpose of having the child to make the child a U.S citizen or somebody to cross the border illegally amateur how long have you been here if they have a child the child is not a citizen I'm okay with all that\nBut you have to make a legal change to the constitution you don't just say it because you feel like it next that it has to actually be changed and ratified by the states that's the right way to do it that's what the founding fathers put it this way\nWell hell yeah you could change or laws hell yes you can change the laws you could\nChange the constitution you could amended there's an amendment process you can't just snap your fingers and make it happen no and yes I've got people sending me emails no the federalist papers say listen to me\nI understand the federalist papers give context to the intent I understand that\nLet me be clear as I can the fourteenth amendment is written in English I read English I read it very well understand it I comprehend\nAs I read that it doesn't say anything about the parents have to be you know I'm subject of the jurisdiction there are eight says all persons born the person who's being born is the child so yes change it\nThe thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments were about slavery and abolishing it and getting rid of it it was to make sure this amendment ended up itself was to make sure that former slaves were not treated like\nLike less than citizens by the Democrats they've tried to do that the Democrats tried to make sure slaves would never have the rights of citizens and the writer citizenship they tried to grandfather them out of every voting\nAnd the good guys the Republicans said screw you were going to update this constitution and make sure that those people who were born here\nOf slavery now have citizenship should should the people who amend the constitution and the Eighteen sixties should they have made sure they wrote in their ...\nFormer slaves would be citizens or our citizens yes they probably should have because this is this is way too much up for grabs so yeah I think it should be amended\nI think it should be changed I don't think the president can do it none of his own let me grab a quick phone call before we do the interview at the bottom of the hours go to Lisa in Houston least about a minute go ahead\nHi out they were like the way to nominate but I think that are down here we are talking about they said we cannot\nTake care of everything we just can't like I said right now 'cause I'm going to court and the people I Know we're sitting there at all that is a clarinet or I think they should let me tell\nYou you and I agree but but I disagree that the president can do is be some sort of executive see that's what we complained about what bronco balmy he kept on going around Congress should be done the right way I think that the fourteenth amendment and it sounds like you agree should be changed but on the go any president can just with a swipe of a pet and make that happen\nNow I don't I don't know I haven't started that I'm like oh no question about that if they are they in general I think it like out first out in our country here that just and they don't care 'cause\nYou know and it's great that the or the kind of near that at that point you're just south of where you got a cafe now and for that first\nYou and I agree I re should at least out of Houston over the line now editing nine four one ... Joe ... dot com a representative from the VHS we come back to stay here [noise] books\n\nGutters dot com hey their names in the website [laughter]\nThe website Houston pattern cutters dot com do you think other people do that at this point yes I think that's a given\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates days locked buddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win ...\n[noise]\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Instagram email all that and more right there also Newsmax\nTV it's the Joe ... show really led to have you here and really glad to have kitty Waldman she is a homeland security spokesperson on the caravan and everything else is going on down there Katie how are ya\nHey how are you thinking for having me on the I'm living the dream really glad to have you on I mean obviously your eyes are trained to what's happening\nSouth of the border and uh it's it's all very interesting how this was going to come to fruition they probably will get here\nBy election day but but one could assume that was the playing by whatever entity decided to make this happen at the age you have to you guys have to at all consider how something like this even got started because I don't see a Twitter or Instagram post going out in Honduras saying hey joined the caravan\nMeans something had to put this together do you guys get into the idiosyncrasies of how this\nThat have been started to begin with or are you you're just looking at what's happening to the border\nNo certainly secretary Nelson as engaged constantly with our partners in the northern trying Gulf hot Honduras Guatemala El Salvador Mexico\nSpeaking with their leadership about you know how these did form and how we can prevent future caravans\nSo so the thing starts and it's a thousand two thousand people I've seen some numbers as high as fourteen thousand you've got political parties pulley one way or the other way\nAnd do you just really cute play the politics would use the the the policy B. S. O. P. if you will for when you see what could be considered invading force heading north or border which the policy that's employees which the standard operating procedure\nThere right now we're tracking a large group of approximately thirty five hundred through southern Mexico and trapping a second group around three thousand between Guatemala and Mexico the large group to prevent any safety threat to our nation is securities American people run Methodist simple we will not allow a large group of unauthorized migrants to enter the U.S in an unsafe unlawful manner\nAs you mentioned we're seeing these groups for so they break immigration laws and Mexican Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics against both Mexico and Guatemala immigration security teams and that's why the president has\nCalled up the armed forces and we're working together to make sure not only we secure our border that we secure our personnel in our front line men and women who are charged with defending our nation's borders\nSpokesperson ... security is Katie ... have you seen the videos I'm Talking about I I\nI'm I'm seeing people that are Eighteen to thirty five they're generally speaking mail there tattered from head to toe they're wearing bend down is over their faces so we can't identify them it almost seems like if you fall is moving north how big a concern is that it's not just you know mothers in little children which is what the left wants us to believe you got people who are like a fighting age hitting our way\nAbsolutely I mean but that's what we're seeing every day crossed our southern border last year Seventeen thousand criminal aliens were apprehended by CBP including three thousand special interest aliens you know from countries that we deemed terrorist concerns yeah it's it's I mean that's not unique to these caravans but it's certainly alarming when they have an intention of breaking our\nOur nation's laws\nAnd be part of the care of and does not give you special rights to enter our country\nYeah ... and that's a great point um when it comes to the laws of Guatemala they broke them they broke the laws of Mexico Mexico actually offered refugee status to thousands of people yesterday who turned it down that makes it obvious to you and to the director of that their goal is to get here their goal isn't just to find a quote unquote better life\nNo I mean we you read the same stories I'm reading which is that these people have been primarily removed by ice right or that they're here seeking a better job and again that's not asylum if you're a truly fleeing persecution from your home country\nAnd you don't feel safe there anymore stopping Mexico you've made it to a safe place a safe country to claim asylum and Mexico is providing a lot of good benefits that they've announced in the last few days to these these migrants stop their claim asylum in Mexico\nAnd get a better life and and I believe Mexico said we'll give you some money would give me some food we've got jobs available but it's really not about that ... what do you think it's about\nYou know the number one and number two reason you know these migrants that out an incredibly dangerous journey north is one for family reunification for illegal aliens are you living in the United states and the second is recognized like opportunity\nAgain that's not a silent you know I mentioned that dangerous journey thirty one percent of women are assaulted during the journey and Seventeen percent of men\nJust discuss you know\nI don't know what to say I didn't stop in Mexico you have made it to a safe place claim asylum there\n... it's interesting it's pretty wild and homeland security spokesperson on this caravan and so much more but you're absolutely right I'm fifty two growing up in South Florida I saw refugees who really do need asylum they needed to get away from Castro they're gonna kill 'em\nUm if they did say like the like the government or people coming from the Soviet Union we have to get away from you they will kill us put us in the Google in the gulag if we don't agree with everything they say that's true political asylum where you're going to die if you dare say a one freedom and liberty people coming from China\nAt the time of the other one square tank would run you over if you dared say I want freedom these people aren't running from from political or religious persecution or prosecution or are they I mean I I haven't seen one interview with one one of these refugees are these\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated

of uh tweets a bunch of ... years by the way I Love your engage in the program I appreciate that\nBut all the auto\nYou've got to look at the attempt was read the federalist papers I Know the intent was the intent was that the babies would not be citizens unfortunately the way was written was horrible the fourteenth amendment was written horribly therefore it says what it says I understand what the Supreme Court said no that's what it says\nThis doesn't apply to the children of those who are in this country\nIf they're born here their their citizens here\nSo what do you do I don't think the president can do it executive order to change it I'm reasonably sure of that by the way I'll ask a guy who's much more of the constitution than I Am a next there'll be Ted Cruz will ask you about this\nBut when it comes to the intent I get it the problem is the words they use and how they wrote it it needs to be updated it needs to be changed ... ... to be dumped him in rewritten whatever you have to do do it that way now is the president really under the impression\nCarry wondering where you think about this do you think the president is really under the impression you could change it through executive order\nAh [noise]\nI don't know you just started around ... started the argument and maybe he's just during the conversation but it did kind of sound like we can actually a guy and that yeah we're working on it were in the process and and I can do it because they told me I can do it\nWhat's interesting about that is when I went to the other will be hurt I went to the White House in my interview the president\nAh yeah her to know what I Want to remind me how about ... ... yeah I Know when I Can't remember did you go on a trip or not [noise] I did not I was way too busy\nYou don't want you to ... and here's this isn't real they didn't want me to go because I didn't think the u._s. should order the president who you are when we're around\nHim for nine letters to the president I've told you about Ramos ... yes absolutely\nI had to force you to say hello to to Governor Perry Ryan's I Want you to listen to the times why we\nHad I not told you to do what would you have not been told me to do lead that oh no I force you to do it and I was being demand controls they live neighbor lady you're going to see a lot of a governor you hire right now\nAnd I did which may governor his hand yes\nYeah what's interesting with junk and you know this was in Studio ... to him\n[laughter] yeah well I write down a chicken and told me that I Wonder where\nDo you remember there was\nLittle let me just say he went running as of now he is not whether a little bit that drunk or the lowdown won't necessarily loaded I don't know at night you're going to apologize to apologize to you know can you owners and what you do [laughter] I did not say that you're there was this big name grownup Gino Gino did not know that because\nHe said he said that his uh his neighborhood in San Antonio they call them you know because we felt that his eyes look Chinese\nRemember ... how'd you listen to the interview well ... bad he said I had a really lonely boy\nIt's not a packets were not endorsing any one we're just giving good education good information good knowledge about the true fact the uh ten or Fifteen different issues on the candidate\nWell we know every single position so we're not trying to say we're door singer opposing what we're trying to say that you care about life or or marriage or religious liberty or the Supreme Court\nKavanaugh was a big issue this year no need to know where the center stand on there so we make these available at Thirteen key Senate races we can talk about that in a second\nBut it you're exactly right Joe it is fraud it is a copyright violation is actually a violation of criminal violation of the election coach now if it's tied to we don't know yet we're in the process of investigating this but if it's tied to the ... campaign it's an FCC violation as well well\nIt is or John graves his group is vision America dot org division America dot org I'm going to go have named the stage it's Texas Florida Montana Indiana I'm Missouri West Virginia Arizona Michigan Wisconsin Nevada Tennessee and North Dakota has happened in every one of those states region in Texas\nYou know we don't know we know for sure it's happened in several different cities in Texas but today I got another a contact I just got out of a a a group that I'm In another airport I talked to pastors all over the country\nOr that will get engaged in there so we don't know how widespread it is we've got a over a million that these are going out in Florida for example that are in paper that are going to church is all over the place so\nA and a and a lot every one of those states you just mentioned Thirteen fourteen states or within the margin of error or within just a matter of either of the the the races up or down just by single digits\nNo they're very very close and that's why they did it here but let me that's not how lazy why did they just come out with their own counter lines you know I mean why why actually put the name of your organization on it because when people if they click on if they go to a vision America dot org they're going to find the real positions aren't they\nWell they are and that's what we tell people that do go to vision America dot org and you can enter into a if you're on Facebook you enter into the button they'll face but messier click your state and you'll ... you'll get a free voter got lots of it is going on\nBut what you touch on is the reason they didn't do their own voter guy is they're trying to deceive people they didn't just do it they carried it inside the church is they literally took the packets and co mingled them with a real voter got inside churches whatever handing them out\nAnd then left and the way we found out about it is a husband and wife went out of one of the churches in different door she went to get the kids he went to get the car that get out to the car and they got different voter guys they looked at it might wait a minute that came back and talk to a pastor he called us we started learning different places and we found these people were very\nI don't I don't want to say too much on air right now 'cause we own investigation or not but they literally would go from city to city and change clothes sane people change clothes when they went from one location to another location to another location\nBut yeah and it's so morally wrong I mean it's wrong when in any way and I think that you have reached the ending unfortunately the lectures one week you know a way that All right I'm going to be really good the oldest known to the courts by then probably not we know how the court system works but I suppose in some way that we're doing it\nBut I mean just to reiterate they went into churches ... should bring to bear God they're lured and there was a Butte

whereas a lot of people there's a lot of a voter apathy\nSeventy six percent of the people in the mid term do not normally vote and one of my big passion is the reason we have some of the problems we

like I said I got another call today\nAre so we may not know until well after the election but it just goes to show the links which they'll go to deceive and distort the truth and\nAnd really all we're trying to they were not make an endorsement or a post on were given information and most of the people who believe in these biblical issues you know if they get educated they tend to get involved and I can tell you how many pastors I've talked to\nEven in in this race that we're talking about in Texas once they find out oh wait a minute I kind of like something I heard about Iraq or

management issues rather you gotta come you around um tell me they were having a conversation you keep on as soon as you can probably I gotta tell ya I keep on asserting things and you're afraid to answer my questions regarding the earning things which are ...\nVery stupid I mean honestly word I'm trying to have a really cool conversation with you you've gotten four minutes so far which is two minutes more then I give most people most people get a man and a half two minutes I'm willing to have the argument with you then you go to international law then you go to France and when I tried to re bought anything you say you're get mad\nDo calmed down your I've only got about another minute and a half ago I have to go to break William make your point as to how I Am wrong without inciting international law and bag and France tell me what I missing when it says persons born here\nAnd and or subject to the jurisdiction there up because as soon as the person was born here there are subject to the jurisdiction there up if they're born in my studio they're born in Texas they're born in the United states of America they are subject to the laws here\nI'm missing it but if you think I Am don't totally or you're wrong about your interpretation you're wrong about what you're thinking and your thought processes this I don't care what your opinion is telling me factually why I'm wrong and I'll here you go ahead\nSubject to the jurisdiction there is some personal is an unnecessary language if you simply say born there has to be meaning attached to that phrase if you're born hair boom that's it that's why I have that language\nI'll answer your question do you do don't ask me a rhetorical question to answer you this actually was going for foreign dignitaries this was for if somebody is a Saudi ambassador and they're in the in the ... there in this country there are subject to their own jurisdiction they're not necessarily ...\nAcross the board don't me weren't says that show me where it says that let's say you don't want to look at it don't mean word says that that's where that's where\nIt will tell you this I Believe that you think I'm wrong and I can I can appreciate that I Know that what I said is right and your way of delivering it was nasty and angry and I'm not really sure why let me like a brother we get off my phone I don't understand why and how to get like that I mean I'm more than willing to listen to you\nKnow when it comes to a foreign dignitaries that person comes in and says okay I'm going to represent my nation and Mike capital and Mike king or my whatever my president\nAnd I'm not I'm not subject to the same jurisdiction as you are I get that\nAnd that actually does diplomatic immunity that makes a lot of sense this however is not a degree Terry this is the person who know exist because he or she was born here we must change the fourteenth\nIt's that simple gotta go Ted Cruz when we come back humid here Joe farm [noise] so\nThat's not going to happen we like to mix it up here we like to keep it above board he got angry you got rude I had to put him on hold for a second if you don't like the way I handled in that school you don't have to you absolutely don't have to but I'm always going to stand up for my opinion a by the way we've got a great call right now in the life of a new Senator Ted Cruz senator how're ya\nBaghdad doing terrific right the way\nIt's always a pleasure to have your own maybe there was a lot going on in this fourteenth amendment stuff I've gotten kinda got started here because this thing completely as people riled up they're excited on one side they're scared on the other side the fourteenth amendment seems to say what it says another gets poorly written\nAnd probably should be rewritten but let me start here because you're foreign away more of an expert on this kind of stuff that I'll ever be a does the president have the right via executives or via\nSome sort of an executive order to make a change or halted amendment\nI\nDon't know and then that's a complicated legal question yeah what I can but I can tell you is the following number one\nI agree with the president that the right policy it's an birthright says I heard it longer than ... physicians that that that birthright citizenship as a policy that doesn't make any sense that the debt it rewards illegal immigration most of the countries on earth\nDon't credit for citizenship on people who are there any legally right ... and one of the things birthright citizenship\nCauses is is is a phenomenon now known as birth tourism where women who are eight nine months pregnant get on a plane come to America just had a child here to have that child uh granted us\nCitizenship that doesn't make any sense we should have a legal system that ... that that follows the law and we should be bringing people to this country who are going to generate jobs and generate economic productivity and and so I think is a policy matter ending birthright citizenship is it is common sense it's the right thing to do that again you at your go ahead\nWhat you asked is it is the legal question the legal question of how to do it there is a significant dispute among legal scholars there are some legal scholars who argue the only way to end birthright citizenship is through a constitutional amendment you\nOther legal scholars have argued that that Congress could do so through stats that whether the president can do so through an executive order\nI I had not seen the legal analysis and the argument that his lawyers are putting forward I Want to wait and review those legal argument set of steps that on the merits I had not seen an argument put forth previously that can be done on the executive order but might be whatever means is is it will surely they challenge and the courts and ultimately\nThe dispute about whether it has to be a constitutional amendment are not will be litigated may well make it all the way to the U.S Supreme Court regardless of the main the right policy is an birthright citizenship\nHis website is Ted Cruz dot org Ted Cruz dot org to get there and help them in the home stretch you've got to be election a week from today just one last thing on this you and I both read the federalist papers we understand that you tend to the law was to ensure that former slaves were not denied their citizenship which is what the Democrats wanted to do the Republicans had to step\nUp and make sure that these folks were fully I'm a franchise in franchise citizens of the United states of America was never supposed to be for those coming across the border in fact they talked about ... dignitaries and their children\nNot getting birthright citizenship because they were subject to the jurisdiction of a different country a different nation state these children as they are being born in the second they're born they are subject to our jurisdiction our laws or regulations we must change\nHow badly written this was I think there was an assumption by the forefathers and I wonder if you agree that we would all of course we wouldn't just give citizenship to anybody who was born here but the way it's written in plain English suggest that they are\nWell as as I said it is an open legal question whether Congress has the authority Congress generally has what's called planetary authority over immigration matters which means blanket authority\nIt's an open question whether Congress could provide that the children of those born here illegally are not granted citizenship I support that approach I support a statue that does that now we passed a statute to do that it was\nAbsolutely and certainly be challenged in court that possible a court would strike it down that that is a good faith legal dispute that I expect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jesse Kelly Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "30"}
