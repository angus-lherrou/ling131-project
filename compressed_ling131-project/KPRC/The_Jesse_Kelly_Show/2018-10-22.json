{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Idaho who came up with that idea but that's pretty crazy eh we're having a drag queen fights here in Houston\nOver the drag queen story Our done at the Houston library\nA group\nIs suing the drag queens story Our because it's funded by the city of Houston it's drawn criticism from some members of the local\nCommunity who don't appreciate their tax dollars being used this way the suit against the president of the library as well as mayor Sylvester Turner it was filed on Friday after the free Montrose neighborhood branch again hosting the drag queen knows where it is free Montrose Montrose hello Montrose\nThey got hosting the drag queen abandoned an effort to provide children with positive in clear role models\n\nThe library director and Turner accused of violating religious freedom by using taxpayer dollars to fund the events the story telling sessions which began in December or advertisers appropriate for all patrons of all ages\nReally you think so all ages\nKnow you just see what you want about drag queens and I you know I I I've already said I have very libertarian attitudes when it comes to these types of things but one of the one of the issues that I Do have with our children is how\nOn one hand we seem to want to expose them to things that younger and younger ages\nYou know and the other hand we seem to want to be over protective in so many other ways I'm just wondering how those to work with each other I mean would you take your five year old for example to drag queens story Our at the library so your five year old could be exposed to\n\nThe L G BTU community so they can be exposed to guys who like to dress up like women and pretend they are women\nAgain as an adult I have no issue I'm Talking about a five year old is this something we want to explain to a five year old\nThen again I'm sure some of the parents and ... have no issue with that whatsoever so do we want to tell parents Montrose what they're what they can and cannot do with their own children\nDo we want to involve them that way\nThe um here's some quotes about this a drag queen story telling our according to the ... this is from the library's website right there in the library website these vibrant queens will help to instill a sense of love and acceptance and our children while encouraging them to be\nTrue to themselves meanwhile protesters have turned out was signs that read this library ... children and drags need prayers that public platforms\nThe soup describes the point this is people who describe themselves as Christ followers whose taxes up on the library and therefore they have rights too well\nI don't believe in exposing five year olds to drag queens so I don't care what kind of stories they telling but by the same token\nI Can't honestly say that I have a library doesn't have a right to do this well we all have a right to do is to make our own decisions for ourselves and our families of what we're going to expose our children too I think it's inappropriate to expose your children dry queen at the age of five or six or seven\nI think it's appropriate inappropriate to talk about sex with somebody who's five or six or seven I think it's inappropriate to have any form of sex education for five six or seven year old they are not kind of weird this way but I think five six seven year old should be five six seven year olds\nUnder what circumstances do we need to promote anything sexual orientation or otherwise do five or six year old why\nDo we feel the need to do this will make them more accepting more accepting of what is that young age they shouldn't even know about those things you know we\nWe start sex education in schools that are younger and younger age\n\nAt what age do need to do this certainly if you're if we're going to teach sex education we want to do before they reach puberty\n\nBut there's no reason under what circumstances can you make a case for dealing with sexual sexual orientation or anything else having to do with sex with a five year old\n\nNow if you take a five year old they have a story read by drag queen you might need to make an explanation because after all they're going to see somebody\nWho looks a little different although some of them quite honestly or a little scary some of them are quite beautiful if you get right down to at least that's my wife feeling well\nMy wife big strike queens or unfair because they're prettier than she is [laughter] or or at least some of them are my wife were pretty by the way\nShe does it a whole lot more for me the dry queens would thank goodness for fifty six now here in ... alright heres I Wonder if we're going to hear about this site Trump rallies tonight again don't go anywhere near Toyota Center if you are not a part of that rally or not a good place to be a curiosity seekers there are\nNot just the people who are going to be inside the better probably twenty thousand people but they're probably be that many more outside\nThere to put up speakers outside of the the Toyota Center so people can hear what's going on but if it's going to be as do down there and traffic is going to be a mess\nAnd that's it if you don't want to deal with that that's not the place to be a tomorrow morning I keep your age we will be playing a lot of audio love highlights from what the president had to say here in Houston obviously you'll have some nice things to say about Ted Cruz's formed you Ted Cruz and a couple of weeks in the election you might also\nHave something to say about the immigrant caravan I'm pretty sure he will I'm guessing he might also have something to say about another major tax cuts for middle income people coming he says in about a week and a half\nThere you go in his own version of a pre election surprise it's right which is pretty smart in his bark\nIf you're planning another tax cut and there was meant for a while but he is planning another tax cut yeah now's the time tell us about this right before the November election\nHow big a tax cut\nI don't really even have to tell people how big the tax because it's going to be people have already seen what happened with the life stacks got how it stimulated the economy how those crumbs is Nancy Pelosi calls them are making a difference in family budget each and every month yeah I Hope\nHe gives us some details but even if he just tells us yup the tax cut his coming details in just a few weeks I think that'll go a long way towards making people even happier\nWith what's going on with our economy and with our president have yourself a great\nDay see tomorrow morning bright nearly five day was your prior on key to your age your my back here tomorrow afternoon at three on gay the R. C. [noise]\n\nGallery furniture mated America studios\nFederal guards radio station [noise] your\nSleeve here\n\nHaving a dime they sell like ... is President Trump again saying you've already said the central\nAmerican countries like El Salvador and Honduras over a group of thousands of migrants headed for the U.S border\nTo believe and he wants his we've started a new and because of that now there have been plenty aside stories that he's dating some woman who is a radical lefty\nOr maybe maybe a a Muslim she can be a Muslim or not not the radical but allegedly she was a Muslim and gotten his ear\nHere's a guy that was raised in the suburbs by a white family he was adopted ah here's a guy that was always on the ... about his Christianity doesn't talk about that much anymore he takes pictures with people like Linda source or so Colin Kaepernick is either ignorant or he's just not somebody who likes the country it's one of the other\nBut he also started doing this when he was benched he he wasn't doing this when he was a starting quarterback for the for the San Francisco forty niners walked away from a contract worth ten uh ten million ... million dollars a year and then he turned down another contract with another uh another team the Denver Broncos he's pretending like he's being blacklisted a black hole to the NFL\nBut let's wipe all that away let's say that he was really you really get his heart and soul decided he was gonna meal\nBecause he thought that there was something unjust happening in the community between the black community black neighborhoods and the police let's take him at his word that that's what his problem was\nIn public correct me if I'm wrong or you know more about the NFL than I Am I paying attention to it but the NFL as far as I understand\nHas dedicated and promised a hundred million dollars\nTo make things better between the police and communities and for so called social justice that is the number right it's a hundred million dollar Emily some yeah so the NFL steps up and says All right we hear you\nWe would like for you to stand up and show respect for the flag for those who have died defending the flag and what it symbolizes and for the national and we'd like you to stand up we will give you a hundred million dollars toward what you your protests have worked\nWe'll give you a hundred million here's a hundred million dollars and and let's start working on this problem let's get back to playing football and stop the whole deal and stuff so that one guy read tells the other guy Jenkins who stopped kneeling I guess he's standing now\nAnd readers still kneeling because he's an idiot ... immigrant idiot\nWieners matter Jenkins for saying All right the hundred million dollars sounds good luck to make that happen let's fix the problem we've been saying there there is read\nIs matter Jenkins for saying thank you for stepping up here in our protest and doing the right thing read just wants to continue kneeling we do I have it right Paul he's calling to sell out because he actually said well thank you for stepping up here in our protest and doing what we believe to be the right thing\nRight\nThat is what happened right he's calling you a sellout because he's actually not dealing anymore because the NFL stepped up and said we'll do something or protest about if it wasn't about about fixing whatever they felt the problem was that what they're trying to do\nOr you\nKnow as you say yeah I mean pretty much he accusing him and I guess basically taking the money from the NFL and then and that right and I guess basically shutting up now\nI guess here say because I'm a simple and you told me this every day I I'm a civil and what exactly is it that you're dealing about them if it's not about solving a problem whether\nA figment of your imagination or a ... a real problem if it's not about solving that\nThen what is it about just to get the camera trained on you while you Neal is it so that you can wear a Fidel Castro shirt to a press conference after the game like capital did holding up on high a murderous dictator in Cuba's Fidel Castro ... what is this actually about is it about just\nBetting attention is it about tweets is it about re tweets what's it about it it's not about solving the problem now if you want to solve the problem\nAnd you want to Neal or protest or do what you think will help to bring the solution\n\nAlthough I disagree with you when you claim this is the problem\nYou at least should have it in game you at least should say\nThis is what will stop me from meal and now you're going to Neal forever because you think\nThat the country was founded by bad guys and it can never be a good country and unless we hand every black person in America a million dollars or something we can never ever make up for slavery if you're that guy then you're never gonna stop kneeling that there's nothing that can happen to fix whatever your issue is\nBut if you truly wanted some sort of an end game if you truly wanted some way to say my kneeling my protesting my my raising my voice by being silent or whatever has achieved something what does that look like\nI I I guess the better question a better way to ask the question is what do you want\nBecause what you're doing is disrespectful it's anti America it's the entire freedom and liberty it's anti military St type beliefs so what is it you want to stop being that guy\nAnd if you can never stop being that guy that I never coming back to the NFL and when I say I I mean the millions of men and women and children who've decided not to watch your game because you're a bunch of jerks that\nDon't even have any clue while you're doing it if you're arguing with the guy who is satisfied with a hundred million dollars toward solving the problem then you don't know what you don't have a solution in your mind to whatever it is that your problem happens to be today\nIt eight nine for one pack Senate

eight nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe ... you calling in about ... stuff is they need to let them go where we're we're we're done with that there you go boom have a nice one or just going to go there you go good\nAre you see semi I did that if you were calling and it wasn't saying don't blame her okay\nUm I Want to talk about taxation because this seems to be some sort of a crazy stumping point for um\nFor the left to each weird to me so let's talk about a taxation\nYou work and you make a dollar depending on your tax bracket on that dollar and he says after\nYou get to the tax level in the brackets which they make a complicated on purpose um let's say you're the top tax bracket under Obama you are giving almost forty cents of that dollar to the government just because it will you say well why why are you taking forty cents of my dollar\nAnd the answer will be because that's what it costs to do business if you want to do business in work in this country and you dared make that kinda money that successful you have to give us\nYou have to pay us off to allow you to keep on working think about that that's where the taxes yeah with the taxes taken it it's ... it's used for good things packs you're not really saying that right that's really not true I disagree that the government shouldn't be so involved in as much as it is\nFree housing free food free healthcare me free lunch for the kids at school\nUm we we never ever were supposed to have a a government that was more like a charity that was never supposed to be involved in charity that should've been faith based organizations\nWorking with communities you know the skill soup kitchens and homeless shelters and and food banks we did that as a community were good people we've always done that for some reason the government sneaked in and started doing it and they said well would you want to continue doing that unless you don't like the less you hate the children [noise]\nAnd if you're a poor people in the homeless what about our veterans [noise]\nIf you are it lush you hate all those people you'll give us more money in taxes\nWell I don't buy that game I don't play it that way\nSo when I seen Andrew Gillum like I saw last night go on and on about how to see it is supported President Trump giving a bunch of corporations billions of dollars in tax breaks I went oh All right if I Lived in Florida My vote would report it saved us because that's a good thing\n... out of good things are of all the rich are getting richer the poor getting poorer you're taking the poor and giving you the rich hey taxation is not taking the poor and giving it to the rich me giving somebody a tax break isn't giving them money is actually telling them we're not gonna take as much\nBack and see when corporations get tax breaks from I don't know let's be crazy and say from thirty five down at Twenty one which just happened in the last year or so\nWhat did they do they took that money that was now there's ... didn't get stolen by the government didn't get confiscated inflict didn't get put into some government do what it did was each state and the corporations hands and instead of putting it under the mattress or giving to the shareholders they gave it to the employees\nThree and four million people\nGot big bonuses huge bonuses because these companies got got more of their money\nA lot of companies said we're moving back dude man you just lowered taxes to the point to where we can do business in the United states of America Again we're going to start manufacturing there again\nWe're going to we're going to expand where do you get more people more jobs\nBut you got a guy like Gillum or somebody like Obama or somebody like Clinton or somebody like\nPolo see or somebody like read or somebody like Sanders even further in Aurora cause you a protest they're going to say we need to raise taxes it's unfair when it kind of tax breaks these rich horrible people got it's disgusting handed them all this money unit hitting them anything\nThey just got to keep more with the air and and they got\nTo spend it in their local community ... whether it be their business their actual neighborhood there said either state doing good looking all the good things that have happened\nMillions and millions of Americans have gone back to work millions and millions of Americans have gotten raises millions and millions of Americans got bonuses they otherwise wouldn't get\nThat only happened because the government stop stealing so much of their money\nOn the left actually he's doing its level best to convince especially the young generation of Americans the taxation is somehow good\nTaxation is bad taxation is making government bigger regulation higher end it's legitimately it's literally stealing money out of your out of your harder and harder to work\nYou have a dollar that you earned and the government says if you're evil enough to make too much money we're taking thirty five cents or forty cents\nNow there are some people that nobody gets taken from them\nAnd some people actually have no taxes taken out and then they get a check at the end of the year that they didn't earn that doesn't make any sense either 'cause that's coming from people who actually earned it is being stolen from these people and given to those people and still people like Andrew Gillum horrible for Florida is complaining or are complaining\nThat corporations aren't paying their fair share\nThat's ridiculous if you actually look at it\nThe corporation was the top one percent the top ten percent are paying so much more the top ten percent in this country pay Seventy percent of the taxes thinking about that Seventy percent Ninety percent pays the under thirty\n\nYou think that's fair you up more of that you are the government to take more of their money and this is Santa buys them from ever hiring more people are researching and developing more widgets or expanding their their footprint\nYou want them to move away like they did before it's that manufacturing right here\nWhen I see somebody on on on a debate during the
