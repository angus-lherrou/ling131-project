full scholarship as ... as a drama\nI knew it I mean [laughter] you know how many attorneys\nThey also have miners in in dramatic arts because you'd need to be a great actor in order to be great attorney\n[laughter] any though he's a brilliant attorney and all five kids I mean to my parents now I don't want to you know I mean we all are scholars and I don't know if it came down to that you know have enough ... where\nThey're not but at that time that was you know for the Internet which my kids have no clue what does that even me see that's the that's the line at the mark ... for this new generation before the Internet they're like well how does the world exists [laughter]\nYou know and by the way when I was when I was focusing the the free range child comment um ... it's kind of been for the other extreme that we have an ... again this goes back to the law and more parents with a helicopter parents with all those are two distinctly different things but the helicopter parents of course they they they want to keep tabs on their child\nEvery step of the way and and when they see a kid\nWho's out on the sidewalk ... eight nine year old kid by themselves they panic\nThey freak out even though you know for previous generations and and there's been statistically proven is a safer world now\nThan it was for my generation I'm we used to routinely be I'll be on the road was you know\n... before the streetlights come on or other times the streetlights come up that was the general rule [laughter] so my mom didn't know where I was most of the dating or does she see movie worry that much about where it was now maybe that's not the right way to go either but we've gone to the other extreme avidly\nI absolutely it has absolutely swung the other way and that's what often happens\nDoes it ... happened to see that sometimes from generation to generation I remember that exact same thing I mean we leave the house the morning you know and just go play\nYou know and they leave the around and then there was like either a dinner bell or whatsoever you knew a certain time to be home and it's not like today where the kids have cell phones and I'll tell my son I'm like you put your location on put it on I Want to know exactly where you are at all to you know\nYou know because they were number one because we can\nI was talking to another parent and the other day saying I Can't imagine if like what like we did when we were younger just going out let's say for the night and then your parents having no clue\nIn this day and age I Can't imagine that world of not having that ability yeah well the idea\nThat goes to that goes to this whole topic I mean a lot of it is to\nPeople are so many people not all people some people are doing better there's more discretionary income\nSo they can provide more for their kids so they think they should\nThat's not always the case especially when you're sacrificing your you know safety and security in the future so not only are you sacrificing that but you're you're actually harming your children\nWell I think the problem part of the problem here is um there's always this is\nFrom every generation to the next there there's a couple of things I Believe in any way um ... see what you think about this that are always at work here in but you have\nA parents are always competing with other parents as far as providing their kids with the things that the other kids have\nUm they compete on things like birthday parties they compete on a whole variety of different levels um that's that's part of it is but they're also competing\nUm the kids are competing with each other as well for things like grades and the best colleges and the best in the schools so it sets up this very competitive environments where we're I think parents feel like they really\nHave to be in control of what's going on if their child is going to be successful\nHere you're absolutely right I mean statistics show that and in this day and age and if you don't have your kid in a violin and knowing Mandel and Mandarin\nAnd um you know six other languages and having tutoring that at a time as the age of five then you're already\nBehind and that's the thing ... ... extreme there but there is something to that if you don't have your kids in select sports or in tutoring really early on then by the time they get to high school oftentimes to get into some colleges\nThey're behind\nAnd so and then by the way when you talked about that competitiveness social media plays into that\nOh yeah I Know dust socially or late\nInto that and they will tell you I mean even get one of my son is a it's a Fifteen and about a year ago a lot of his buddies all started talking about so I kind of cars jak going to get like they were all discussing\nWhat where they're all getting picked out like they're starting to pick out their cars and my husband and I just kind of looked at each other like I'm sure the schedules are going on in your household that's not how it's working here yeah you know\nYou're just I'm sure your kids have been disappointed numerous times [laughter] would would your would what would your version of reality which doesn't doesn't be to their friends versus a reality that's for sure\nAnd they tell me that I didn't mean that it\nGives you ... that the kids ... you're supposed to be mean Murray it's okay if you're mean\nYes I get my child tell me the other day what am I go to to this other friends out because you know she's a coup along you know even daddy have rules literally laughing [laughter] yes because\nMy job is not to be your friend my job is to be your heritage\nRight exactly right and my dad told me that probably every day of my teenage life but you know it's it's funny because people worry all the time about their kids getting into trouble\nAnd um my father was so strict in my fear and I'll use the ... it was a healthy for you but it was fear nonetheless my fear of a disappointing him\nOr be\nSome form of punishment which could possibly be in reality nearly as bad as I thought it would be\nThat that all hell would bring down on me so when I was old enough to stay by myself with my parents went on vacation because I'd football practice I I just thought that was gonna have a party one night\nAnd the party [laughter] you know the party no no the party lasted ten minutes to ten minutes for me to become so anxious that these guys go do something to the house and my parents would find out about that I cancelled apart\nSo my my father's print you found out no no I didn't I think I probably should invest it as an adult and my dad's literally [laughter] I'm sure you just left he said good I ... I did buy job Maria gotta run we're out of time but thank you so much for joining me James Bond\nGreat up to ... really good too that's Maria luge the empowered bomb check her out on YouTube have yourself a great day I'll be back tomorrow morning bright and early ... was pure prior on uses one of the news Katie region right back here tomorrow afternoon from three to five and keep your seat [noise]\nPBR see Houston and I are ... the federal\nGovernment made in America studios Welcome to get your sea nine fifty\n\nDowngraded by still dangerous sign Lisa ...
