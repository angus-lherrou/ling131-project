by agra and here's what happened to him he\nIn by the way he drank it in liquid form I Know it comes to bills I guess I didn't realize that comes in liquid form\nHe drank drank way more than the recommended fifty milligram dose I have no idea how much he drank\nBut he began to see a red tents and flashes of light now they have done studies in the past that found that you do too much of that stuff can go side effects like blurred vision and increase light sensitive devotee the flashes the light flashes went away the next day but\nNow his vision is red eyed and I don't mean his eyes are red I mean he sees everything and Brett\nYou imagine that um\nHard to say if it's a permanent situation but it it could very well be you know don't don't take more you see everything in red\nStill sees everything in red weeks later so I don't know if the red vision is ever going to go way so that that that's a side effect that may be a permanent side effect for him\nHere's another one I'm getting all the stories I haven't had a chance to get through this week the ten things that um these people said to help them live to be one hundred now the first question I have is why would you want to live to be one hundred\nI mean it gets so you get to one hundred percent discount on your birthday [laughter] that doesn't seem\nWorth it because I'm sure you're spending way more than ... medical costs see here's the thing people always the doctor's always said to me things like well what would you like to live longer and try to get you to make dietary changes\nYou get your cholesterol down um did you get more healthy way all that kind of stuff and I always tell them at the same thing well if you could give me the extra years like right in the middle like right like if I could stretched thirty to forty it'd be more like\nTwenty years than the ten years that it is that'd be great whether you're going to give me ten years in the end when everything hurts and I can't see and I can't get around anymore and then I'm probably going to end up in the hospital do I really don't\nNeed an extra ten years but just in case you do\nNumber one piece of advice you ready for this one these are all from people these are all people that lived or still alive after the age of one hundred the number one answer twenty nine percent ignore traditional dietary advice\nNow by that I assume what your doctor says about low calorie diet and all that goes to ignore it\nTwenty five percent say eat a healthy diet so there's the other part of the group that says no no no no you got to eat a healthy diet stay active came and number three keep a positive attitude came in number four\nNumber five drink alcohol regularly there you go sixteen percent said that followed by abstain from alcohol or smoking maintain meaningful relationships get a good night's sleep be nice to others\nAnd number ten and quite honestly am will set didn't end up a little bit higher but have said\nThey was also a factor and all this you know the end of the day what the bottom line factor is the roll the dice of your DNA whose genetics did you get you know did you did you get you to get a the the\nHeart if somebody in your family that lived to be a hundred years older lived it will enter the nineties I guess I have a fifty fifty shot\nIn my case my my brother turned Ninety this summer so she's nine years old a blog is living person in her family by far my father died\nWhen he was Seventy four years old so by today's standards as relatively young so I don't know who's who's gene pool and my drawing from\nYou know what I'd rather go Seventy four eighty I think I I'd be really happy if I could get to like eighty eighty four eighty five I think I'll be good with that\nAfter that I was things suspicion will fall apart like nobody's business by warranty will be over there'll be no more parts left for me\nIf I Can't get the parts are than that there's just no reason uh to do to keep that going there's no reason whatsoever\nAlright uh we've talked a little bit about parenting this week we had done to merge over teeny last hour by the way all the good time to remind you that the entire program as always available on podcast or Jimmy bird show dot com is it the last show as always up there for you to to check out so if you want to see if you can do that any time if you don't have time to in the afternoon where we are doing it live between three and five and you know just\nGo on Jimmy ... click on the broadcast enjoyed anytime you want to but we have talked about parenting we did last hour and we were talking about a helicopter parents in law and more parents and and all the things that were doing for our kids that really are not they're not kids best interest and how you know we have somebody really really young kids right now\nThat are used to talking to people on the one on one basis they um\nThey don't know how to relate to people they they only know how to relate to you know the image on their on their cell phones they they'd rather text and have a conversation that very uncomfortable conversations\nPart of it I think has to do to with this study this is a parents never get any alone time and what you're talking about earlier this week about this gaping your dad's escaping to the bathroom so they can get along time most parents have just thirty two minutes to themselves everyday\nThirty two minutes out of a twenty four hours a day is the only time they have to themselves so they freely admit that yes they do hide from their children at least long enough to get a breath of sanity study into the everyday lives of two thousand moms and dads\nRather typical parent is just over thirty minutes of themselves everyday once worked in their parenting duties are tempted to and there's probably that thirty minutes right before you fall asleep and with free time hard to come by the average parent polls that they take the hiding from their children four times\nA week the route space that's because thirty two percent of parents don't actually stop working until at least\nEight PM when you figure in the parenting part of it having dinner or getting dinner you know\nHelping kids with their homework whatever it is you might be doing with your youngster or maybe whatever extra curricular activity they might be doing and that that's that's a big part of it doing all the parents are helping themselves very much because went obviously they've got their kids doing so many different things\nEnrolled in so many different things so many different programs sports and all the other things that go along with it that uh you know\nThat that that's a lot of free time that goes away their to their survey was conducted by a meal delivery service\nOr found free time is very elusive although there are benefiting from it right nobody has time to cook so they're delivering the males\nTwenty four percent of parents have been more than thirty hours every week directly taking care of their kids in addition to the other responsibilities in addition six ... taking kids to school and other various activities while parents wrapped up by troops to the grocery hang a bike trips to the grocery store every week\nWhy don't you make a list and have to deal with their kids acting out in misbehaving an average of five times per week I don't\nI don't see anything to do with this survey as far as part of the deal then you just like they have kids it's just part of the deal alright enjoy being with us today hope you enjoy being on the program\nWe'll get back on Monday taken tomorrow we'll get back on Monday five to eight we share of fryer Katie our age Houston's morning news that might back here three to five Monday afternoon ... have a great

I don't care yeah\nHe's like I don't care about your little story that you told me on the radio I'm Fred you'll do it I Can't drive thought it'd be a Ken Terry give us the update out of the Senate Judiciary committee end from the full of before I ever lose FBI thing was submitted ...\nFrom CBS the general consensus that far from Republican to view the FBI report about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's background is that yields no new information or additional cooperating information Democrats however blasting the report as severely incomplete\nSenators on Thursday or taking turns have you in the report falling demands for a more thorough investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct leveled against President Trump's nominee the White House just seem to report overnight and transmit it to the Senate Judiciary committee before each member of the Senate had the chance to have you made single copy in person on Capitol Hill\nRepublicans do plan to begin voting on cabin on the Senate floor friday with final those on Saturday and that you're just you're a committee Chuck Grassley claim to report revealed nothing that can then he did not already know unveiled no contemporaneous evidence to support the allegations Senator Dianne Feinstein the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee said quote\nThe most notable part of this report is what's not in it\nAnd one senator was only have one copy on the report to review in a secure room in the basement of the U.S Capitol the White House as senators have ample time to review the seventh background inquiry into Kavanaugh's record\nAnd senators on both sides are expected to do with a report in one hour increments an effort to limit the possibility of potential leaks and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion Wednesday for cloture vote on Kavanaugh for friday\nThat was close to the situation that anticipate confirmation vote to come sometime Saturday and precise scheduling will come from McConnell\nOh there you go to\nThe bottom line is I don't see other Democrats who stuff is even if they wanted to and trust me they want to I don't see how it's going to happen now now let me ask the general question are those who are listening and watching it eight nine four one pegs idiot eight nine four one Seventy four seven\nAre you ready for this to be over now and maybe even better maybe even better um\nHas this energized you whether you left or right Democrat or Republican conservative or independent or liberal has this energized you the polling seems to say that the left is a little embarrassed by what's going on here and maybe not as energized and the right is like awakened\nSo I wandered idiot eight nine four one packs Joe ... dot com has this entire debacle\nAnd to\nThe bottom line but the left just never really gave this guy a chance and we're only resisting because she was a Trump appointee has just pulled over their faces heavy overplay their hand have ... at the end of the day prove themselves to be ... children\nAnd\nYou know you see McCaskill's probably gonna lose\n\nSee that ... who who is it in I'm In North Dakota get bigger name she'd done by twelve boys now she's gonna lose she's out the Senate probably will pick up a few a few extra Republicans instead of seeing fewer Republicans and more Democrats as these were were promising and expecting\nThey're going to see fewer Democrats or Republicans\nBecause people are awakening to the fact that they don't play fair they're trying to be fair they're not trying to find the right person for the court they're trying to find somebody that well they're trying to stop or you don't realize that they they would be happy to have eight\nSupreme Court justices for the next two years until twenty twenty they think they're gonna winning twenty twenty the presidency there would be happy to make it an eight member court and have a lot of ties and when a tire happens at the Supreme Court Terry what happens\n[noise] uh I don't know what happens if you if\nYou introduce right the last time they send it back to the previous ... right so the Supreme Court will be powerless if the left gets its way I Know\nOf course were to blame it on Trump but it's on Trump's voltage their fault they overplay their hand I think the Republicans are energized and I think that things are starting to turn Renault you're going to a place to go and vote those sitting your hands and not vote emitter\nYou got to go and vote and let them know how to do with this whole thing was\nWe come back we'll be Gary burned former Secret Service officer right here on the Joe ...

[laughter] I'm telling you wouldn't be able to build a fence high enough ... and I asked them you know I have some piece of we're neighbors in general and the reason I tell you on the ... I Will tell you that\nIn anything that she's ever done and you don't it's not as stressed to say that she's a complete failure and everything she's advertised I mean she couldn't even be a good personally I mean what is it really can be a first lady has to do is show up on time and re Munch\nAnd do some support things um I mean if you want to be behind the scenes the first lady but she didn't want to be first lady she wants to be president or co president and that's what she wanted or Bill Clinton administration I'm telling you right now she was but definitely between the President Bill Clinton\nAnd his vice president Al Gore I mean ... and she caused more habits because everything she talks during the ...\nWell the saying was that I don't remember you told me that somebody else it probably would you um eight years for Bill eight years for hill that was the saying right yeah and actually\nThey were saying that when they first were coming in Arkansas now when you know normal suburbia got hold of that like\nOh no that's not the way our constitutional oh that was just a joke you know\nIt wasn't it scary burned get his book is called secrets of the secret service so as you watch this unfold and as you you were part of that White House and you were a secret service officer um er during during the Clinton years while you were you with other presidents there were just them\nI was I started with a pop up bliss okay we're ... eight years of the Clintons and then two years with\nUm George W. Bush yeah George W\nCool um so I mean you definitely a difference in temperament between the bushes and the Clintons but when you see what's unfolding in Washington now the just the sheer attacks on Kavanaugh what made me think about you was\nI was ...
