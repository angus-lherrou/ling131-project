{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Thing that Donald Trump has done is to convince lots of celebrities and very wealthy people that they too might be president so Mark Cuban who's the owner of the Dallas Mavericks are up here was saying that he might run\nFor the Democratic nomination and challenge shot Donald Trump I don't care much about that anymore but Thomas tire out in California is a very wealthy a person has talked about running Oprah has been mentioned\nA number of times uh [noise] uh and there will be lots of others Michael Bloomberg is spending a hundred million dollars in this election cycle to boost democratic candidate\nIn the hope of a creating some gratitude toward him he's thinking of running he's about that same age mid Nineteen seven or\nA mid seventies but uh\nThe person on top of that CNN poll is a former vice president Joe Biden who is a generally well like particularly by white working class voters in the mid west where Trump did show well to take democratic states\nAre away but they're going to be twenty twenty five Democrats who are vying to face off against Trump and lots of names we can't even imagine yet are going to or at least take a flier at it\nWell in addition to age though Joe Biden I mean he's got the reputation of being crazy Joe is he just kind of liberal version of Donald Trump when it comes to some of the things he says and does\nWell he he does have a reputation of being a gaffe machine but if the if he as ban in national politics since the middle of the Nineteen seventies she was elected to the United States Senate when he was twenty nine years old and you can't legally serve in the Senate until you're thirty\nSo he had when he became thirty and for the next\nThirty some years was in the United States Senate lots of foreign policy experience and then eight years as vice president and so we might have some instability of Joe Biden were president but it would be a very different kind than uh than what we share with Donald Trump\nOr and it depends upon how the next couple of years of the first from term goal whether people are eager for more of it or looking for change\nAnd that's the way it always is Baltics you don't get your first report card if you first term and if things are going well economically we have a tendency to give you a passing grade in movie onto the next four years because it really is all about the economy\nUm I well yeah it is yeah I Will say this about President Trump you say what you want to like him or not he has a he has\nDelivered or attempted to deliver 'em virtually all of his promises in the first two years in office and that's almost unheard of\n[noise] yeah most\nAnd let's have a checklist of promises that they've made it that\nThey uh they try to address even if they don't get exactly what they want to President Trump has done that because a number of things that he promised the border for example he's still working on the border wall he's got a little bit of money or but but not the thirty ... billion that would take\nA to build a thing but some\nIssues like that are as good politically as they are if you actually accomplish them so whether I'll ever get that wall built or not I don't know and some of the other things that he did a like promising to revise snap day he has got done\nBut the the new intellectual property requirements in NAFTA came right out of the TPP which she withdrew America from\nSo there was a little bit of wobble in a in some of his policies and sound is attempts to make good on campaign promises\nWere trying to ... from a as amused a political scientist or I'm sure you talk to students there all the time Cal what what are you telling them as far as um\nThe future of politics how political campaigns have been changed by social media for example his Facebook and Twitter and all that completely changed the way the political campaigns run all across the country\n[noise] well they have uh the main the main difference is that campaigns used to be prosecuted national ... presidential campaign\nOr with what you have a cold air wars campaign commercials going back and forth and today with a social media in general and Google and Twitter and Facebook are the ads that people can be targeted\nA down to specific interest that people have so it might be a couple of hundred people to get the same message rather than a couple hundred million and so it's much more targeted and you can play on people's emotions and play on their\nTheir particular issue concerns in the way you simply couldn't thirty or forty years ago so campaigning is very different but but what I tell students and while Charles your listeners is that\nMany people uh don't watch politics very closely don't follow issues are candidates very closely and so they can be driven by by false claims a whereas if you read a newspaper a daily you'll be in the top ten percent\nOf most informed citizens so reader newspaper read time magazine read the economists watch the news hour rather than any either Fox News or MSNBC\nAnd you'll be in a position to understand what that politicians are talk about what they're offering a and whether they're making any sense at all\nWow you still read the newspaper ... absolutely [laughter] and I want you to me as well and I know I still I still do I still do um\nYou know we just have a tendency unfortunately to digest over information and in soundbites that um yeah if\nYou're getting your news off your phone you're not really gotten much news\nRight well and if you get your news out of certain newspapers you're getting a slant to so it's just you know just to go to so many different sources as possible because they're you know see what you want about Fox News and it doesn't sound like you're a fan there are stories that they are recovering um that the other side won't cover because it's you know it's it's positive towards the president\nSo the truth almost always live somewhere in the middle of most of these things that you have to go to a variety of places is if you say you want to be well rounded if that's the goal would be well rounded then you've got to go to more than one or two sources in order to be able to make that happen\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right but but some sources\nAre are are are better than better than other people can shell reasonably watch uh the national news and\nUh and the news hour on PBS is is very good time magazine Business Week air con and less are all\nVery good but as I said Fox News and MSNBC if you're looking at both of those you're likely to get stories that the other isn't going to cover but in either case are you going to get a sort of both shot down\nPeople come up and I'm ... and and what they said was um we love your songs and man she's got a chocolate voice\nSevere Jerry Lee Lewis on underlying like word for word verbatim [laughter] let's go and um when I had the microphone in my hand people are actually asking me to sing\nNow or do you or do you not think I said I'm going to say you did\nI did and of course they all came [laughter] like I ... I don't I mean NATO yesterday [laughter] how are you that\nThere are that they get up there in butter downing Laurie already\nRight there in front of a hundred people where I Would just say hey before we got to have something like having a ... no I did not have it on for the audience I guess it was great it was really cool um did we hung out with Ted Cruz\nWe hung out with a with chip Roy showed the district Twenty one Republican running for Lamar Smith seat we hung a\nSubstandard guy comes up he looks really familiar\nLike who's this guy and he goes Hi how you doing Joe I I've been on your show ...\nWho is she able to get a ... that was that he walked up to be a first\nYes I did so you do I did\nThat that's the young memories because of my my my memories you know shot at this point it my advanced age not as old as carry but when I enter now and it was it was the will of ... he's the hero uptown oh wow\nYeah I heard he was\nThere last night to none of my\nSteve how are you that his wife was there and gets wherever it is very very nice and it was a really nice gathering you know what was different about this topic and I don't do a lot you know me I I live in ... where do I learn it well ... ... exactly right it zero zero zero zero zero we'd be alone and I'm\nJust going there you know and and I'd already had a debt you know that I had a day we had to do and we did yeah and you have no idea what the date was before the day we had on the air mhm so um yeah I was like our go down here and I got there just knocked me out of it was really nice\nAnd it was nice to be at a gathering where I knew I wasn't going to be attacked because they feared believe in traditional American values or I was going to be attacked because I support Ted Cruz I was going to be a ... you know what I mean you almost walk around with eyes behind your head knowing that people here what we say on the radio and see him you know we do and\nAnd if you dare where a make America great again hat or something you might have been a soda through in your face and have a stolen or something um it was nice to walk around and not have that thought you know what I mean ...\nThat's nice that's good so ... years later and go\nI didn't know you were going and I wasn't invited\nHow 'bout that did I not talk about it yesterday that I was going to go no\nI probably did but like I had all of the night before you guys do listen to what I say uh well I ... down a couple of times [laughter]\nYou may have been his math okay I I said I was going to go to the good night\n... she was ... he said something was going on but obviously you can do is you know in the show but then as soon as it was only going to go to like the after saying\nI couldn't do the debate because the debate was actually happening in the hour after the show and and hermit ville it's a good thirty thirty five minutes away from where the after thing was happening but I got there it was great we hung out with Ted I met Heidi and the girls had not met them before so that was nice I'm ... and again people were just being\nWere they were filled with passion about what was going to happen so what I I'm pretty sure of the nation saw at least bits and pieces of the ... Cruz debate did you watch it you need the art watch or did you watch it live\nI had a duty art and I did not like him I\nSaid do you watch it afterwards or no yeah so did you walk away thinking that you're you're the journalist right down the middle you're unbiased that you walk away thinking somebody won or lost\n[noise] um I Will tell you it was different than the first only because I mean go Rourke is behind and he's really trying to win this things down he went a little different angle that jazz and can cruise last night than usual and\nI'll help you in words you're looking for ... you went negative ... yeah yeah well you did on E. and addicts I mean yeah I mean he actually brought outlawing technique here's the weird part today and I think this is why he did it the left media is reporting that\nBeto O'Rourke savages Ted Cruz by bringing up what Trump called on the campaign trail\nUm ... and he did he called them lying in bed and he actually said this is the way this night is going to go he's going to lie to you he's on truthful he's a lawyer he actually said these things\nAnd when he was responding to was Ted Cruz saying that Robert Francis O'Rourke actually was pushing for a ten dollar per barrel surcharge or tax on every barrel of oil produced here in the state of Texas\nThe Kerry did did a work do that or did you not do that in ...\nHe did do that and yeah I'm ... and after Ted said this is what he voted for this is what he wanted he wanted to add ten dollars per barrel to every barrel produced in Texas\nAnd when it was a ... turn he said that's a lie he's a liar he's long about the positions I've taken these lion Ted\nTrump called ... and so forth and with the left media is ignoring today I mean the down the middle and and the right media are reporting it correctly today would they would they refused to report was cat\nHenry bottle and would Cruz said afterward was okay we'll put the actual legislation and your actual vote on my website Ted Cruz dot org so people can go there and see that's I think that's exactly what your status is that's exactly what your position is\nAnd that's exactly what you voted for\nHe was also awoke was also given a chance to to say he regretted voting against tax breaks for businesses horribly affected by Harvey he voted against that he was one of only four Democrats in the state of Texas in the house who voted against it\nI mean that's nuts that was a bipartisan move and of course it passed because the Republicans have the dominate the dominant position in the house and Senate ... voted against relief for small businesses after Hurricane Harvey and I and I think the most agree just moment\nFor Robert Francis O'Rourke who were really exposed last night and it's a simple he was expose I look I don't have to be on the writer Ted Cruz supporter to know the the exposing he took on this one issue\nHe was talking about border security and he was asked the question about what will you do to secure the border and his answer was this I Am from El Paso what he said I'm not he is I'm from El Paso El Paso we had what was it three or four murders last year\nAcross the border in war as they had three thousand\nAnd then he talked about communities in I Believe in the police there in about ... he started giving these weird reasons and then of course one of those cruises turn ... workers basically throwing in a big fat watermelon softball\nBecause crews that are out of the park as my nine year old daughter could have\nThe simple answer is there's a wall there there's a fence there as a work was saying we don't need a wall or a fence he was giving an example of how a wall on the fence works it works very well Terry where in Texas is there a wall or a fence yeah the border in El Paso the Internet\nAnd there's a big bridge you could go there and come back when they can come here and go back via a port of entry abridge otherwise the community of El Paso is protected by a barrier\nHow is he possibly going to use that example of how a wall or a bridge would ... wouldn't work it was nothing to me\nAnd then you walk away and I think those who are being honest said wow I mean that wasn't even close and those who are dishonest are reporting that he somehow savaged\nTed Cruz which makes no sense because he brought up lion Ted\nYou know the guy who called them lying in bed and and Ted had buried the hatch it so much that he's coming next Monday and he's going to be campaigning for Ted Cruz\nSo I'm not really sure what the whole modus operandi was yesterday except to say he's a big fat lie and lie or how do I know because Donald Trump says so owned by the way I'm the candidate O'Rourke who wants to impeach Donald Trump the guy whose words for twenty sixteen I'm using it gets my competitor now it doesn't make sense the guy's floundering\nAnd there's a story out there that he's raised ... million dollars that's the true number ... ... s them\nMore than any senatorial candidate ever in us history thirty eight million\nWhen the Democrats asked him to spread the wealth around a little bit will he be sharing that money with some other Democrats the answer reportedly I didn't hear him say this reportedly is no the here's a guy who's running for Senate as a a modern neo socialist\nWho just said no to the ability to be a socialist with his earnings or his campaign dollars\nCome home and what are we talking about here and it's actually getting a little bit nutty so last night was a slam dunk for Ted Cruz he took it seriously he did amazingly and and that the award actually looked like a an amateur I think that he probably walked away thinking that\nUm eight eight eight nine for one pack editing nine four one Seventy four seven did you see the debate heavy seas and reporting on the debate today do you think you're getting an accurate fair assessment of what happened last night in San Antonio\nAgain eight eight nine for one pack we will talk about the counters that how that showed did or didn't do in the ratings would have thought about a lot more including Jason Lewis the district to Republican for the great state of Minnesota\nIs is being challenged by the same woman he beat two years ago and it's a very interesting I'm I'm comparison between the two one is talking about issues once you're saying she's mad it it's all very odd Joe ... show come right back after the writer\nJoe ... with a live video feed is just J. O. E. P. A. I. G. S.\nDot C. O. N. click on the play button it'll start playing that is if you don't have it on the radio if you have it on the radio I certainly would prefer to get the ratings there but stop by if you're in the house you if you're at work if you can't listen to it on on the radio by all means we put that video feet up just for you because we love\nIt Gary how you doing ...\nGood decision I think we should wait till ten or Fifteen minutes into the show every day to see your ... pop up on the video games the anticipation my listeners interviewers fame will be a pattern you know what I mean ... ... yeah\nThey were there you go All right so um yeah talking about the debate from last night we will talk about the counters that you said you were going to be ... did you watch the ... I did watch it dead guy ... I mean everybody knows what happens on it but was it well done gonna make you sick to your stomach did you think it was stupid what did you sign\nWhen not impressed and I was a big fan of the show when Reagan was on and I probably not\nGoing to watch the raf it's not a theme it's just ... different shows not told me\nA somber show where people die it's just not what it's about it's about you know talking about current issues and making you laugh about who we are as the people I mean is it to me it doesn't make any sense I did not watch it it didn't DVR I Know what happens on it the ... did you see her tweet\nI did yeah come on that ...\nWas not the best part of the night I was ... yeah\nSo we'll talk about that in earnest as as we go forward but I definitely want to talk about the enlisted I don't mind mixing it up with you if you think that somehow Ted Cruz's hypocritical for taking the door Smith of the president of the United states a guy that he battled a you know very vehemently they went out at man\nThey won added ... and and I gotta tell ya I didn't mean both walked away with as many as they were about eat what each said\nI think they walked away with a newfound respect or what is cutting back down\nAnd they work together on a lot of really important legislation that has been very good for the American people it protects us our lives and I'll take those calls to don't be afraid about what to do it it eight nine for one pack eight eight nine four one Seventy two four seven we go to the phone lines because I I really am interested in hearing what ... and especially those outside of Texas even\nI Wonder exactly um what people are thinking about the the Lone Star state because I think that people have a certain image of who we are as as Texans and I think a lot of people are surprised that a guy like old war two was so far left in so far socialist is even in the ... okay did you hear that but he has been telling people that his mother was a lifelong Republican\nYeah I heard something about that earlier today\nYeah Beto O'Rourke\nHas said his mother was a lifelong Republican who for the first time in her life will vote for a Democrat because he's running\nMhm yeah I mean that's a hard to research is it\nNow\nThis was my voted for ... just to come out they got some ... I Wonder have you know ma'am and then there are like the ...\nUh no this is a works mother a lifelong Republican\nAmong other reasons she noted for him\nNo I mean\nFor for president in two thousand eight either she voted for and\nProbably Obama no wait a second bad though\nSays that she's only voted Democrat or I was only voted Republican her whole life and will now switch to vote Democrat just cause her son's running mhm so clearly to vaccinate who she voted for\nWell then I guess you have to know Republicans ashamed of McCain a newer right the first Muslim rock\nObama be forget I mean seriously do we really we do we really have to fact check his what he says about his own mother and I guess now I don't want to I Want to take him at his word but it turns out he's full of it so yeah I mean it's being reported by the blaze that in fact uh works mother voted for\nBarack Obama got ... we're not sure who she voted for twenty twelve but that's definitely who she voted for two thousand eight and\nShe's also correct to him by saying bad though I I'm not so that I'm a lifelong Republican I was an independent\nWho will never Democrat even got the Republican Party role if that was not trying to get ... votes in Texas by lying about who your mom voted boardwalk ... brother ... by do that though I could break here we come back your phone calls eighty eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com ... [noise]\n... [noise]\n\n\n... was all over the Late Show ...\n... email always there also we we designed to the website carry the people wanted me to read is on the website so we did to give you now have a section\nFor parodies you go and check out some parodies there I'm not a bloated anywhere near the amount of uh parodies I I I have that I mean it's hundreds is what it is it's hundreds of them so we'll see\n'em so we've got that for you also be interviews that I Do I did three yesterday Eric Trump is on there Sean Duffy is on there are Jeff I'm a deal who's running against Elizabeth Warren is on there to go check it out plus my other interviews done juniors on there for a couple of weeks ago\nAnd there's a section for um for monologues I probably won't be able to to populate that one is quickly Cary because\nI tend to just do the monologue and forget about 'em and then I'd have to go back and grab them off the video or whatever and put them up there but I Want to do that for the people as well but the feature that people wanted most\nIs this live video stream and they wanted to be easy so now when you're mobile it's the top thing for us to play button you're watching while you're eating ... topping press the play button you're watching and ... and again I urge you to listen on the radio but if you want to see you know carry chocolate voice over your there she is boom showed her right now\nRocket leaves that gold what does that today ... golden already girlie I could not I could not rock that color good as\nYou probably could not my brother we're that knows what that is illegal although I may go buy some but it looks like that I think we should match one day one day we should warn me let's do a week of where we coordinate [laughter] okay and that now that kind of lets coordinate okay\nAll right so uh we had the debate last night and again it's a national story because\nThat though I'm Robert Francis O'Rourke has has gotten so much in donations from from far left groups from J Street look that up or you don't know what that is he sees he says these are just what about your duty takes J Street money that's a big political action committee\nOr you've got money coming from Hollywood you've got you know these the darling of the left Eli loves them in the Late Show loves them and and this is what he does\nAnd but when he debates he he kind of make support themself I think he looks a little bit ... looks a little bit immature may maybe you'll get better as he gets older but I'm now it turns out he he was long about his vote about the ten dollar a barrel of oil shirt charging tech just because\nI'm lying about who is mother was politically all these years in who she voted for petroleum ... not the case um\nAnd and he's and he's calling the sitting senator the lawyer who's actually telling the truth about this guy's on record very strange to me oh\nAnd he used to having the praises of El Paso that has a ... I think that'd be the all clear recognizing that I had them listen to one I saw last night\nJust on curiosity where are you 'cause I heard a lot of the mainstream media today talking about that six second pies that a Senator Ted Cruz had last night and Huffington Post and going nuts over this after that question that you know send out in such a softball question and how can they take them on line to answer in\nWhat ... I'll be honest with you I don't know a question that was when did he ever since I was told him I had to jump in the car and I had a good ... where I might have missed\nThat one of the questions tell us something you've done in the last year that's nothing to do with politics that like give Texans ... who you are as ...\nWell actually that turned out to be a very funny moment the after party I'm Glad you brought that up mhm um I didn't know that he that he paused for six seconds I'm ... and his aides or I thought it was appropriate which is well got to be honest with you and I think that the the congressman all agree this is all we've done for the past year\nAnd and he talked about how he couldn't go to his daughter ... on the game or something yeah right so I mean I I don't know why are you worried about how long you pause it and it wasn't really six seconds\nAnd that's what the hunting and posted saying I've seen several times and they thought I I work when this one and I thought I didn't know what they were talking about Iran but I mean one thing\nThat wasn't the funniest part of the answer\nBecause 'cause cruise actually said this last night the after party and got a really big rousing laugh out of the crowd he was talking about the blind squirrel I'm\nMegan wide yeah back to his daughter was is there something back to health E.B White score yeah go ahead what a blind squirrel isn't that just isn't much of a joke you know he's ... not every once in awhile probably was behind that was coming thing\nNo last night that yes this really did happen and it's it's out there on the Internet somewhere I don't have it we don't have video of it but there is video that somebody took him to posted it the first thing I said was my name is Joe ... Joe pack the ruler but you can Kobe do and that that's it [laughter] the crowd was I had him in the bottom of\nMy ... and how to do it all morning in that and and and I won't elaborate much but Ted Cruz did make reference to a ... stone last night in your party uh-huh okay Salem ... item Lardy blood on the stove or somebody who's lived with his army definitely did you when they're\nFor now I now see I don't know God and I think that listen I think\nThat he was he was advised by whatever the hell it is that's a ... um call him a liar at some point bring apply in Ted that the president said oh by the way also I Wonder if those across the nation today really believe or work when he says I Can't wait to work with the president on this that and the other\nHere's a guy that has promised to impeach the president should he become elected to US Senate\nWhat he wants to work with the president and he's using the president's words against Ted Cruz\nVery odd to me all these very strange it eight nine four one package Joe packs dot com let's expanded a symbol take calls on this to let's expand it how would you make the debate system better I mean obviously we're better than to guy standing on the stump in a park okay that's so we've been improved their um\nWithout a doubt technology has given us the ability to support for more people to see and hear more than they ever could before but how would you make it better even further I think people are more interested in debates now probably started from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and maybe even from the Seventeen Eighteen\nPeople that were running for the Republican nomination people have been very engaged by debates again for the last two or three years\nSo how would you make them better how would you make them more streamlined what what would you like to see more of\nIn the debate like last night ... who's the local news anchor and a friend of mine um who was one of the moderators last night when a work was an intern or question did you notice that she said you have a congressman and she tried to say you know he was the actual question if you can give you the it's\nRight right I mean even in the rebuttal she went back to him and said what's your age or to actually doing something at the border and he he didn't answer I mean should the ability of the moderator be disabled on but it wasn't what I asked you at all and I think it should be even if a cruise I'm not saying for one side of the other if you ask a question about\nApples and the answer is nothing but oranges shouldn't the moderator jump in and say yeah but you didn't want yeah\nAnd we're not going to go any further and the question again pleasing writer at done\nVery interesting or editing nine for one pack Joe ... dot com your calls when we come back to the writer\n[noise]\nShow false [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIn many bedrooms bedtime is well complicated especially as the weather it begins to cool well one person's sleep soundly the other is either freezing or way too hot bullet branch makers of the world's most comfortable sheets loved by three us presidents\nIs offering luxury flannel betting for a limited time and bowling branch dot com they're unbelievably solved warm and breathe bubble so everyone stays the right temperature the flannel sheets coming forging studying patterns in colors\nYou're guaranteed to find a style you love plus you could try them for thirty nights risk free but whatever you do don't wait last year there flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks so go to bowling branch dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of ... plus free shipping with promo code\n... ... dollars off plus free shipping right now at bowling branch dot com used my code tags P.

don't pay attention when they're like doing that that well those things well I've never seen a lock on the side anyway of wind showing you know like a countdown\n... in the debate format I think you probably would need that you probably would need his\nSon Alexander and Murray answer right than when we need to think long yeah\nWouldn't going yeah I think it down just have a nice day is a baseball or is it the NBA one of them I think actually does have a like a clock I Can't remember which one it was available I I don't\nI think you're right there is a clock and it they can't decide they just let the the place than I think\nUh but they're also very limited challenges in baseball\nBut uh I I don't know I there's got to be a better way than just allowing somebody just to lie about his own record just to lie about how his mother voted just to lie about offense or a wall not working I'm a ... or whatever even Cruz lied about which he didn't so I mean to me that would make it much more exciting and I think even younger people would start watching\n... that's interesting to me let me go to the phone lines and I I Would like to know\nExactly how you would like to see debates improved because we've got a big interest now not\nJust in this debate but in debates around the country we've got a lot of interest in some the Seventeen or Eighteen Republicans are running for the Republican nomination back in two thousand six team people now are making it I mean it really is appointment TV that was going to carry\nI Would have said yeah a lot of people are a lot more engaged and they were a few years ago\nI mean people in my family who have never cared about the future like is that debate tonight mhm what's your guess back to this let me go to the phone lines to see what you think about this Joe Hi what's going on\n[noise] hello Hey Joe oh yeah I was calling their even though the cars that are you know that I like to challenge idea [noise] but I think a bonus around are the best that doesn't make up the debate\n[noise] I don't know what's going on a deal with your kids or something right with what's going on okay can you hear me now\nI can yeah your phone cut out so you said a bone of rent to sort of a bonus rounded would it be bonus round or bonus time like give it a cruise or something like maybe it gets an extra ten ... ten seconds for thirty seconds or what\nNo I'm saying are having fact checkers checked the information and then at the end of the debate after a everything has been wrapped up at the end you can have a bonus round with the fact checkers will come out and state you said you didn't vote for that tax increase uh ten dollars a barrel\nBut we reviewed it and your vote that showed that ... that are in fact vote for that policy could you please confirming a stance or whether or not you did or not it would give the candidates have to you know that you've been fact checked and and allow to respond to that\nUh I I I Wonder what his response would be I'd like to see just be uncomfortable moment it'd be like are well I ... well they say about ...\nExactly and that's what you look at character you know when somebody's ... somebody presented with the fact\nHow to respond and it's it's from a third party it's not from the opponent if only I can say everything kill the cows come home you know in a debate they're gonna they're not they're going to say whatever they got to say to get to make themselves look at\nAs far as a winning the debate I didn't think I I'm actually affect us or but I didn't think they are I don't think anybody really separated themselves\nUm he's not going to make the five nine points up with a with the debate ... presentation he gave I think in here and knock out\nI think he swung and missed like ... like the wrong opportunity\nWell I think he did too but but let me just let me just question you on that because you sound like a really smart dude I mean ... if you think that it was sort of an even debate and and and I walked in winning it enough rooted for you to think these can you can overcome the five to nine points I hear you I get you and I think what you said makes sense but let me ask you very directly when he said\nThat a wall or offense won't weren't going to use the El Paso as the example\nThat made him look like a lawyer when he said he didn't do the ten dollar per barrel oil thing and we know that he did that made him a liar and nobody called Ted Cruz a liar and when he actually said something that was factually correct that made him look kinda dumb\nUh so I mean what is it about him that that makes you think I'd like to support this guy to bad he's not going to win 'cause he really did horribly last night for you to be a big supporter and still think that it was an even debate that means that I'm probably right he lost but go ahead\nOkay so we all know that politicians while the debate do help ... you know politicking running a government in the country isn't just about winning debates agreed and it's about policy yeah so I think even though he's a poor debater doesn't mean I think you'll be or a policymaker\nI ... what policies the like I'm listening I really am I I really want to do with policies below I\nI'm a I'm a registered nurse and actually a nurse practitioners church and in fact is due to the fact that our population is so unhealthy by the time they're sixty five and getting for us to case manager right they have an adequate care\nThat it's actually more expensive to take care of these patients I'm a lot of people going in and out of the hospital using the ERs as their primary care physician right I think the fact that we have the most per capita uninsured members\nAnd the whole nation really hurts or taxes I think it will be cheaper if we were to actually get everybody covered so that way they can get preventative care to prevent these train wreck\n... it's actually it's probably not ... but it's probably not cheaper\nAnd you know that this whole Medicare for all thing why does what you're alluding to the Medicare for all thing even state wide or or nationally would cost trillions of dollars that we don't have that is true it's a real true fact check it would cost thirty one trillion dollars so that's not the result or look\nI I agree with you we should make sure that people get ... not only preventative care but they should be taught how to eat right and taught how to take care of themselves and they're not in the hospital all the time and the ER should never ever ever ever be used\nAs your local physician would be used and that's exactly what they're doing so there should be a solution there somewhere would all work is saying solving anything in fact when we have privatized health care and it's not any more it's more socialize now that it's ever been under Obamacare which has made it on affordable to most people\nWouldn't we had when we have more privatize health care which is where we're leading back where we could have real competition for health care insurance will will plummet but if I could start buying it in Oklahoma or if I could buy in Arkansas if Texas doesn't do the right thing for me or if I had a health insurance account from the time I'm born\nUntil now I'm fifty two I'll have plenty of money in there to go and take care of my simple needs that have to take care of that's the right way to go that's capitalism that's free enterprise end it looks it looks out for the needs that you have but to say that you're for what ... saying\nDoesn't make sense to me if you're a health care provider he said nothing to you that makes any sense knowing that we can pay for any way that makes any sense why is what I just said not the right way to go to privatize it make more competition make it affordable available for everybody\nBecause right now in Texas is privatized they did not a expanded Medicaid and it's actually failing our\nWhen do they know that doesn't matter and the fact that expand Medicaid knitting on the exchange it doesn't it doesn't mean Obamacare isn't available\nPeople in Texas are on Obamacare a lot of them and it costs way too much money Texas did the right thing by turning away that money that money would have said we're now incumbent upon what the\nThe Obama administration does or what the federal government says for our health care decisions or we'll paddle of twenty eight doctors would tell you you're too old for that procedure or you can't get the hip replacement that's true those are made up facts that's the fact\nTexas said we want to stay independent now if you want something done at the Texas Legislature I hear you Joe I really do but you're trying to say that a U.S senator can do something for Texas individually\nThat's really not true the U.S Senate if you can go there and do their bidding for Texas and I think Ted Cruz is doing that when it comes to health care with ideas like I just\n... like I just presented look socializing\nIf you're doesn't work checking blood checked Cuba that Michael ... Michael Moore thought was so great check Canada check overseas anywhere and find out where the monarchy goes when they need an operation where do they go\nThey come right here we've got the best healthcare system in the world Obama just took it over and screwed it up with his ... his buddy Gruber we have to go back to privatize\n... and ...\n\nThere you go so uh yeah ... is a I guess that she's known for seeing but no carry\nYou use I don't want to say it'd be more which is you just said she was screaming ... than it\nSo Jason Lewis says the guy there now he's in a remarkable job Yusuf people a bunch of money on taxes are much more and I see no reason why he wouldn't be reelected but I guess it's a close race\nCloser that should be we talked about that we come back in eighty nine for one pack Joe ... dot com getting ready to go home [noise]\nIssues\n'cause I think she's she's averse to saying anything about where she stands but I Do notice she's pissed [laughter] he's he's actually he got really the platform Jason is that what she's going was\nWell I think it is I think she's a bit of the poster child for the new left wing mobs out there that are just basically saying no you're not allowed to have your own opinion they're not allowed not to vote for us we're entitled to power and we're going to threaten and intimidating harassed anybody that disagrees and it's becoming alcohol and Minnesota\nWe had a candidate actually was sucker punched in our state and given a concussion and the other day\nIs it this my house a year ago at Nineteen twenty uh uh all of these left wing types of trespassing on my property scaring the neighbor's kid\nOf our town hall at that it'd be coordinated with capital of police on security protocols or getting threats into our office are opposite dripping crash it's just out of control and I think the American people and certainly folks in Minnesota to are starting to wonder just what sort of Orwellian world they're they're witnessing near\nRunning for reelection it's Congressman Jason Lewis district to Republican race due to Minnesota jeeze you work with people like Maxine Waters um do you think that she meant for it to be like this sort of was she just playing politics do you think she meant for people to really rise up and getting your face and yell and scream and punch you off of chairs at restaurants if that's what it took\n[noise] well I don't know the words are certainly giving aid and comfort to that that is that the great irresponsible aspect\nAll this Joe ... some people always get out of control and when you've got this sort of radical and chief of resistance pop out there you don't want to feed the plane and and put in a light a fire to all this stuff and yet that's exactly what they're doing is he's not being called occupy democratic leaders including my own and she's not being called strictly\nBy the media echo chamber to instead of doing their job and saying this is out of bounds seem to be Eighteen it on\nA if you take a look at cable television to look at some of the print or areas and and all the rest\nIt it really is something I haven't seen since the Nineteen sixties and we know how that turned out\nBut you and I have seen black lives matter shut down I thirty five several times you've seen now Portland is basically under siege by ...\nUm what is it that we should do because the constitution doesn't allow for this kind of discourse the constitution doesn't allow for this kind of redress Mrs shutting down people's lives this is inhibiting my freedom and liberty to enjoy my wife is as an American shouldn't please step in shouldn't be a forty hour that was going to be I'll say stop it\nOf course then you're right about this that have nothing to do with the speech when your stated goal is to intimidate and harassed others when they are exercising their free speech right they are weapon I think things like sexual harassment cases they are weapon I think anything they can find out what value Maxine Waters becomes chairwoman of the financial services committee\nShe's going to weaponize that particular a branch of government into going after banks that don't do the ...\nUh if you've got your own ... judiciary is going to have artist an investigation after ...\nNancy Pelosi as speaker and she's helping my opponent in the in the second district giving her tens of thousands of dollars right gene well impeach judge Kavanaugh they will go after the president impeach him in this country\nInto a constitutional crisis we haven't seen and we're certainly not willing to go there most people in my district don't want to go or they want the government get results not write this down\nUm and so this is a very crucial midterm I don't think people realize well actually I think they're starting to realize Jo thanks to people like you know what they care\nNow I'm with you it's Congressman Jason Lewis district to Republican to ... to Minnesota he's running for reelection aged ... was the challenger she challenged him two years ago last I'm used to think\nI looked and I can't really see where she's debated you on the issues\nAnd if we go through the history of what you've accomplished in just two years we're talking about an economy was booming like crazy lower taxes for every Minnesotan everybody who's listening who pays taxes corporate taxes lowered so we can build new jobs people getting bonuses and raises that they never expected because of your work and because of the work of president Donald Trump\nDo people understand exactly how good it is ... and here's the second part of it is there a fear you remind Jason that people get fat and happy and she lives and things are going great I'm not going to rock the boat and go vote", "year": "2018",
