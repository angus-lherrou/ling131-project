I. E. W. E. N. dot com alright are you a hypochondriac\nI'm a I'm not ... I don't think of myself that way [noise] see I have a\nDefinition of what sick is my wife Elizabeth thinks that you know a cold is being sick a cold is just a cold don't you think I mean if if you are well enough to go to work then you're not really sick so to me you gotta you gotta be sick enough to not be able to get up and go to work for it to qualify as being sick\nI mean after all sick days when you can't come to work right and for most folks it's not because they have a cold everybody gets a cold is if you got the flu you got a fever you got something it's contagious then you should stay home for the coldest just a cold but what's interesting to me is I'm a little study that was done\nUm that took a look at what states Google what health information and it's fascinating to take a look at this thing to see what the most Google medical symptoms are state by state by state\nSo if you take a look at Texas you have a guess what the most Googled medical symptom is here in Texas I don't know that it'll help much but\nThere are several other states three other states in fact that have the exact same number one is we do and that would be Florida Georgia and Michigan\nAll have the same number one is we do and that number one is nasal congestion\nThese are all states where they get a lot of colds and these are all states that have a lot of allergies so I think that's why that's the number one again Texas Georgia Florida and Michigan all have nasal congestion is number one\nSome of the other number one's a rather interesting\nIn maimed the number one is night sweats night sweats yeah\nI'm In Massachusetts is loss of sleep\nIn New York state stress at Virginia stress well think about that New York I think in New York is just a stressful place to be and then in the Virginia you know you're so close to Washington DC the old northern half of the state is basically D.C suburbs\nI Would say there probably will stress when you're working for the government\nAlso let's see here in North Carolina loss of sleep South Carolina really dark green stew or AS number one in South Carolina dark green stool acid reflux is the top one in Alabama\nMississippi it's [laughter] it's gas\n[laughter] [noise]\nUh I'm not sure if we're talking about burping farting or some combination they're of a in Louisiana's chills Arkansas thoughts fever Oklahoma\nFlu symptoms that's the top one that they Googled we sort of last year's flu symptoms in New Mexico phlegm [laughter]\nNumber one number one in California number one is sweaty Paul what causes what evolves snoring is number one in Alaska\nSnoring far and away number one in Alaska there are several states where ... including West Virginia where irritable is the number one thing that people Google\nBloating sniffles light colored poop is number one and Wisconsin\n\nOn circumcised problems is number one is in Illinois now hang on does he know that city at the map\nProud of myself right now by the way 'cause you're all children\nShowed on camera I I'm getting this off a list of states in the in the states are not marked as which states we are I just happened to know which states we're looking at the moment up\nSo I'm proud of myself with that um it's just amazing some of these things uh\nIrritable Minnesota where I Lived in Minnesota the irritable too too much winter insomnia morning sickness\nA stomach ache that was number one in Nevada a lot of a lot of a lot of states where stress is the number one item number one item I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think it was the last thing that I might have Googled other medical basis and I think it's when\nI um I I I had a problem with my left leg\nWhere I had been walking in something felt like it just popped and I had this is screw shooting pain and then a week or two after that it started the legs started to swell up so I started to um you know to look up the\nPossibility is good that he none of them seem to be to be very good deep vein from both ... might have been one of the reasons why the liquid swelling up but I didn't think that's what it was because I've never had blood clots or anything like that so I started Googling around and I I figured out by\nGoing out enough of medical sites and putting in my symptoms and this is\nI realize this is not a good thing to do this is a dangerous thing to do the worst thing you could be use your own doctor but I have to have to say I actually diagnose myself up by the time I went into the orthopedic guy I told me I think I have a partially torn or torn miniscule ...\nAnd um I forget\nWhat the what the name was for the flu that was building up behind my knees there was a weird name for bakers something or other\nAnd you don't I don't even know how I I actually ran across that but I ran across that and I thought this sounds like what I got so I went and I told him and then after about a whole litany of medical tests later\nAnd then telling me well you know partially dormant discussed is better than others so I wouldn't recommend that we operate on this so after going through all that stuff\nWhat do you think I had exactly what I thought at\nWhich I suppose isn't isn't good I Would have been better off if I was wrong because that would have taught me a lesson about trying to diagnose yourself and all of a lot of folks do a lot of folks we'll put symptoms in\nAnd they wait to get the results back and then they make a decision on whether or not they're going to get treatment based on self diagnosis which I realize\nIs a dangerous thing to do so I I've I've made a deal with myself that even though curiosity always calls me probably to go on line and tried to figure things out for myself I'm never going to allow that to keep me from seeing the doctor because that's that's where you need to go if you have some medical going up All right among the things I think we're going to work on tomorrow\nI'm Sorry to hear about quitting junk food that

state of Texas it's Emily Miller Emily how are ya and great to me I think you\nYou you know a blood runs what are the other day and I like to be up on stuff and I was really really busy this weekend I was like I I have to go check out that Robert Francis O'Rourke\nUm and and Senator Ted Cruz debate and I couldn't find anything and then I see you you and I follow each other on on Twitter and I see you're talking about\nHow the debate was canceled my immediately thought oh yeah it was a really crappy weak in the Senate and he's on the Judiciary Committee so the jet probably couldn't do it maybe they postponed it but then I see that after the the well we could do it because she wasn't letting this go\nShort of letter right sure did let them go and Cruz was able to debate and almost immediately the the\nIs it be Joe ... which I've just read Robert ... almost as our right congressman old and I should be fourth generation Irishman I Love Irish people nothing wrong with that um she could not do it what was the reason given why he couldn't do the debate that they were planning on doing the day before\nEither a tale very odd reasons why unless you had a very important that he couldn't reschedule guys and then the second one was I had I had and support team had already made our airline flight\nAnd travel and credit regulate\nThis Friday let me tell you they ... they last night Sunday night on friday night we all live in a way it always or find them all ... out last year\nHe can he can he can always find it bad Africa for having yeah that that that's hurting ethics yes right right so we thought we had some data that they are back in the big rally so that we get we all here waiting on Saturday Night last night ...\nO'clock Congress and he's got to the big thing that we gotta now we hear that his campaign like a big announcement that there were I think ...\nI have to take on or anything like that on sweater he's going to be announcing an exploratory rent for twenty twenty\n[laughter] which is which is what he's really doing and you know but I just got a good but before that you continue I I I have to use the word that they used he used campaign said that the Congress but he's already booked they use the word book there\nI'm In broadcasting when I'm booked I we bought this interview today there's a specific time you're doing a specific thing that's so important you can change the schedule I just to debate the guy whose job you want to take it from there\nSo then it's six o'clock last night we're oh I must say our campaign really wanted to know what the they announce it was a big debate that he couldn't speak for the event that he couldn't come to the debate and she has standard totally booked and return it and he's an empty\nKitchen right now is they're going to be a fire\nOr is he going to if you're gonna cooking with gray a cookie what they do I don't know if there's some big announcement coming to have a race hundred million dollars what's coming nothing it was nothing\nTo him over and just talk to him and ...\nAnd like I I Would have at least on my wife and kids in there or something\nThat reasoning that he had to be in the kitchen at six o'clock on Sunday night and said debating in front of millions for millions of Texas talking about I mean that's the real part of that if he had we had a debate with hand to Santa Cruz had a debate with better work\nLike the one we had in doubt on really step substantive issues that are excellent care about the election is getting closer you know coming out of them are sick\nPeople really need to get through these topics so this was that he had this big thing he had to do and apparently it with anything in an empty kitchen during a Facebook Live interview for three thousand people many of whom were telling them how much they love him in New York and they love him in Hollywood and they love him all over the east coast west\nCoast yeah and then it was hard for judge needs a Texan\nOn the issue that Texas care about\nAre you so you just let people know what's he by the way do we know where he was was you know Paso\nIt's very question I don't know who's kitchen it was you know George kitchen yeah let's find out if I'm Out there and we'll tell us where that didn't take on that kicks in ... when he was he was a state\nAs huge as you said earlier southwest is one all day every day from El Paso to Houston from San Antonio to use their from Dallas to use that for most of the Latin watching across the nation right now who don't know that specifically about Texas you can get there from here every single day so there was no reason why he couldn't changes planes again\nAnd go do you believe it\nOr something in that kitchen that was going up at six o'clock I was ready for something to blow at six I ... I was going exploded sexy had maybe at a twenty four hours to sway and they're managing brisket and he had to be there to open the ... I'm not sure but we're all in what's happening\nIs the bottom line is he was able to do anything at this was some campaign ad on Facebook was Emily Miller from the from the uh Ted Cruz skipping Ted Cruz that or Ted Cruz that or go there right now I'm a ... exactly I saw that uh the first debate\nAnd then you'll have it to save forever and to share with your family for good sounds amazing doesn't it it is and you get a great deal because you listen to my program legacy boxes off remind listeners forty percent off it legacy box dot com slash ...\nLegacy box dot com slash P.

four seven lifestyle we talked about\nA Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke ducking another um debate with Ted Cruz\nA Senator Cruz was stuck in Washington and his team said the debates off we have to keep the way you can't leave because of the cabinet stuff then they somehow either for McConnell are from Schumer somehow or got word that they could leave\nAnd Cruz's campaign got got a hold of a work again or his campaign again very quickly within several hours I think was the next day but it wasn't a whole day\nAnd uh they said he's booked he can't do it they were like well let's move to Sunday in Houston the people's Houston deserve this millions of Texans want to hear this debate between ... you know I'm the cult of personality guy and guy actually doing the job of senator and he and he said no he's\nBook he can't at the time they they suggested the debate happened in Houston humongous city were hurt on right now on on nine fifty a and keep your she we love you guys used and um she just didn't get the debate\nAnd what did they set a debate it was a Facebook Live from an empty kitchen somewhere a kid you not\nSo we took some calls on that last hour we'll get to those people who are hanging on but for those people around the country I Know that you're hearing about about Robert Francis or work they're not calling and calling them bet though as if he's Hispanic and he's not um\nI Know you've heard about him because the national media really really really wants to Texas to turn blue they really really really want this guy to be the one who wins they think that if you're reasonably good looking and can speak well\nUm and you seem somehow cool I guess it's cool if you use the word dressed in a punk rock band then you should be the next senator from the state of Texas will see Texas doesn't play that\nHe's only going to lose lose badly\nBut uh I Wonder what people outside of Texas think\nAbout ... all Rourke let me go to California it's where my tears Mike what do you think Hi\nHey how's it going I'm living the dream and talk to me\nOh well I live in California and uh we have an open primary here so for our Senate race it's a democratic it's okay so I don't really have much choice here\nUm so I kind of just decided to send my money to the Ted Cruz campaign [noise] um and I think it's a pretty big deal at how everybody outside of your state seems to want to have an influence on your an election so I kinda wanna to counteract that a little bit\nI actually loved bed no tell me a California works I didn't know that you guys don't have to have a
