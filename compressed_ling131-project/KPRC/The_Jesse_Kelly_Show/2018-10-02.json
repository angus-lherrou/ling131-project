ones that have the little puppy dogs on the truck\nHere's the number one eight to two oh five six one if you need your carpeting clean and you'll probably do do a one eight to two oh five six one or check out the website O O P s steam dot com that's loop steam dot com\nFor fifty now you're on Cape here see All right um we were talking about the privacy and surveillance and cameras and all that stuff and here's here's one of the reasons why I have mixed emotions about it\nI I I really hate knowing that there's virtually nowhere left to go where somebody is a watching you\nOr at least the feeling that somebody is is watching you would think of all the places we have surveillance cameras now where there is no longer any you do any more have any reasonable expectation of privacy when you're in the public\nI don't think you do do you assume when you go into a store that somebody's watching you on a camera in a back room or the lookout for shoplifters I Do you assume when you walk into the ... you actually walk into a banker walk up to an ATM\nYou assume there's a camera on your right so that if anybody ever hacked into the your account or whatever the in the end they did it an ATM than they can ... it at least know who they're looking for I assume that I assume if I Walk into admitted may\nPark there might be a camera on me I don't know that there is I don't know that I've ever noticed there is but I was sitting there very well could be anywhere where where crowds gather anywhere where retailers are and they may be concerned about that he'll be news stories they all have cameras we all know they have cameras\nWhat I've never understood is how some of them are so so bad or so grainy although they've got a lot better at least most of them see reporting and if you're going to have a a camera for the purpose of identifying thieves but at least you can do is spend enough money to have a camera there and it's not that expensive to do that's going to get you some\nGood looking video I don't really have an expectation of any sort of privacy in public I assume that somebody's watching virtually everything I Do I conduct myself that way\nYou know the police have cameras on their cars for the most part many of them now have cameras on the person is for their own protection in many ways it is validated many things that they have done in making arrest and making stops in questioning suspects\nIt is help to review some of the claims that some people have made against the police is also helping out the catch a few bad eggs along the way like this case for example of mount Juliet Tenn\nSee that's the man\nHas been arrested after home surveillance video shows him kicking in hitting your six year old son\nUm this is a ex husband's situation or the woman you know who has three children they were playing outside a\nButter son's father I guess we should say ex husband doesn't say ... ... says he's the accidents say the ex husband Joe said her ... her ... her son's father started spanking their son for his bad behavior in school\nWhich I don't have a problem with those bank will play spank but\nThat's not what this guy was doing I mean he's wailing on the kid in for way too long a period of time\nUm it's kind of like the more he did it the more he got into doing it and according to her anyway he was putting in so much effort that um I mean he was drooling\nWhile he's doing this and he just going and going and going see the camera or they have their house this happened on the front porch was trained on the front porch and is there in case somebody tries to break into the house for example so she's got it right there\nThere's no case of he said she said that this case it moves on camera and it's on video and all she had to do a show to the police\nNow that's the good side of the bad side I guess the good side of it is is it does catch criminals it does catch some people who are behaving in a criminal way we can argue about whether or not with his dad was doing was criminal I Would argue that what he did win will be on the civil spanking\nAnd therefore I wouldn't mind charges being brought in at least there's some evidence that doesn't involve the child having to testify or does even ball but he said she said situation the evidence is there to be viewed by judge and he could make the decision that's that's the upside\nIt does get bad people it does provide criminal evidence in some cases where you otherwise might not have it at least gets police in some cases on the starting point for missing persons especially if they were out shopping or they disappeared from a store or from a street where there happened to be a camera\nAnd in most places there's a camera nearby they can at least catch part of it give them some clue to a car or something else that will lead them to suspect that's the that's the positive part of it\nThe negative part of it is is whether or not we value anything being private in our lives anymore\nAnd if we get to the boy were enough of us don't value privacy that it gives the government or anybody else carte blanche to collect as much data about she was as humanly possible together and potentially use it for the various purposes\nNow maybe I'm being a little paranoid and all this I don't really feel like I'm being paranoid I feel like I'm being cautious perhaps\nI have never had a serious case of identity theft happened to me\nThe knock on wood\nSo it's not like I'm dealing from a from a case where somebody you know physically got my biometric information a made up a fake ID with\nWith my name and my Social Security number and stole money out of my bank account of the of the worst thing that's happened to be so far somebody tried to purchase an airline ticket in Thailand using my credit card number how they got it I don't know probably from me using it somewhere\nAnd they sold it off to somebody or gave it to a friend that they knew\nI'm guessing they sold it off because I certainly never been to Thailand and luckily that's what tipped off the bank they saw that oh wait a minute I'm pretty sure he's not in Thailand hope that purchase\nSo it's not like I've had anything really super bad happened to me that in that case I haven't had my tax refund stolen although could happen it could happen by\nMy bigger concern than things like facial recognition systems are or the other things and that is where the data is stored how we protected we have found that hackers are generally one step ahead of us virtually all the time\nYou know whatever whatever security we put in they seem to find a way to circumvent it or to work around it one step ahead I mean is there any way to really protect this stuff\nThings like our medical records and if there isn't then it shouldn't be put into place where people get access to it [noise] All right you have to leave it to the effort to they have a great evening hope to hear from

your high brow like Terry ... is on the news was a hybrid there's fraud civil left with their shroud I'm about how he's a ... of that um that didn't work but Jeff who's a flake\nAny yes yes I've got a pack thirty today and Jeff Flake and\nYeah yes right but Jeff Flake flakes out and the guy who was supposed to be eleven the vote to get him out of committee was the eleventh vote but there was a caviar that\nThere is an FBI investigation for no more than a week well already a few days and looks like this investigation my wrap up tomorrow or Thursday didn't even need a week because they're finding absolutely nothing so the left has gone from he's a serial rapist\nTo well it's not really talking about for much anymore because a lot of holes in it but I'm In that story and then let's not really talking with Deborah Ramirez because she herself didn't remember anything it was calling around to ask people but anything happened to me\nThis is like very recently NBC News has reported that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath\nLied under oath about not having knowledge that Deborah Ramirez was texting around asking people about their story well it's actually not true he under oath said he knew that she was calling around to former friends did you see this at NBC News actually had to update their story\nAnd then read it and it was it was hatched act fake news and so that's out the window\nThere's no proof whatsoever and she doesn't even recall she just recalls people telling her that she should recall it and then the third person this Julie sweat\nNick has changed her story completely\nFrom what she said happened to what she said on NBC News to the boys let me see there is to say that\nWell she lied would they said was there are some major differences in her story she told us before and what she's telling us now and now there are reports coming out that she is like somebody who is\nSue people for sexual harassment and sexual this and that over the years many times and then there was all sorts of soldiers relationships with boyfriends that she allegedly lied about whatever else so I mean that's I Am an ... just looks like an idiot in this whole thing because that's who he presented\nThen as you said yesterday there were some anonymous person that said oh yeah well he definitely raped me mhm which of course you know there's nothing there um there's a story about him being on a boat\nOn the coast of Rhode Island there's completely nothing there in fact the person who made that story up admitted on Twitter he made it up he said I made it up and now Chuck Grassley and the Senate Judiciary committee are investigating that guy for the lie and taking the time of the committee\nAnd I got it All right so far I don't know what are you hearing more as far as news stories from the left in this country today ... are you hearing more that he's a rapist or a sexual assault or or that he's an angry drunk\nAnd more so than even angry drunk now why do you think that as\nA pie and how they can collaborate any of the reason that they had to run that have come up with a here's a question I don't understand why NBC ran that interview and Julie flat neck they said they kind of ... any room they don't want anything that's too bad yet still around the story\nBecause carrying this day and age and you know because you're you're at a news anchor you went out there and then if you have to retract that later or correct it later that's fine but you have your story this truly happened and the reporters name was Kathy king who is still a friend of mine today she's not in the news business any more I think she was a real estate agent in Oklahoma\nHaving king is it was an awesome young reporter this was her first job at W. O. J. Lansing, Michigan and on veterans' day I sent her out to go interview a I'm\nA guy who said he he was a recipient of a medal of honor and it's a good story right hand and goes that covers the story gets it done makes it happen comes back she's she's thrilled managed as a great story\nMan this story kicks a joke you got to be able to a source of watching her and she's editing the story in in the booth\nAnd they said well we'll show me the money shot well let me see let me see the metal mhm oh well he doesn't have it why does any habit he said he lost it in a fire I so I'm sure that they would have issued um another one\nYeah well he didn't have it I said well\nLet's find out if he actually got the medal of honor\nAnd we did some research on line and back then and this is Twenty years ago probably a while I Know that you'd have as many resources but we could go to sort of a a directory of people who had been awarded the medal of honor over the years and this guy's name is on it\nSo I said you know what I call the Pentagon actually call the Pentagon and she did we were\nI'm not able to verify that she was a recipient of a medal of honor\nAnd later we're pretty sure we found out that it was sort of a stolen valor thing with the guy ... either had dimension thought he'd gotten it or just as making up his whole life and you're sort of sticking to his story\nSo she did this great piece of work to a group of five or six hours to go up there shoot the thing and there were women bans back then in them edit the thing about voice track it and to have be chicken ... and we did not run the story and the eleven o'clock news\nGood and it was great the way she but she was like well can we just run it and then afterwards say hey we couldn't verify that he actually was a recipient but it's a good story for Veterans Day and Easter was banned that sucks but no we can't\nWe just can't and she understood and she was a trooper about it but that's what NBC News should have done\nAnd what did you know how ... how beneficial would have been for their viewership in for their believability their credibility had they said listen we did a story this road who claimed she was sexually assaulted or in rape trains or something a\nAt a at these parties with Brett Kavanaugh and we were not able to verify or corroborate anything she said in fact your story changed so much that we use a news organization\nFounded necessary to drop the story that would have been better no\nYes absolutely I mean now anybody can come forward anybody I don't have any evidence I don't have any witnesses the here's my story I got the ... will say that Iraq and they run with it thinking that well and not be the truth that's at that and I'm Renee\nLater and later they'll just that we're going to go ahead and retract that\nYou know no I didn't really want to know that there's ... and she had the ... yeah\nAnd it is I'm a ... a day nine four one package editing nine for one Seventy four seven I guess the worst charge they have against Brett Kavanaugh is that he allegedly for a piece of ice it's somebody at a bar\nYeah well the guy that you have to add to that you'd be forty concert wasn't that were there when he was arrested his friend was a red light you wasn't right ... says how angry he as the ... very angry I rode the high you'd be forty yeah\nYeah God dude no editing nine four one package Joe ... dot com yes I Do a patch parity today I Want to go play or do you want to hear that he'd want to hear it out of all think about playing it its own Jeff Flake what\nAverage Joe talk show on Twitter at Joe talk show on Twitter go there right now go check it out a let me know if you look if you open up people say they don't want to hear it I won't play Jerry but if they if the people want it you know come through now they're going to say editing I for one pack Joe packs dot com coming right back stay here\n[noise] ...
