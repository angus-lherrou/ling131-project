{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Right I couldn't agree more I mean I I own a home with friends but I also lived in town um\nYou know I kept falling short I I actually didn't have a wall some friends will because my house so high ground I did have a loss in town [noise] um we had water intrusion through the balcony over penthouse um but I've spent most of my life working all the time to try to achieve you know I grew up with a single mom other than have a lot of money\nUm a made a good living what do you do for a living out there and Crosby sure well I was\nAn IT for a long time now trying to start a business on my own and everything but it's just one of those things where I mean yeah the government is is just what you would have gotten to a point where it's just really ridiculous the founding fathers\nThey saw or what what's going on today with all these programs and the way it it started out they would just be aghast that\nWell you look at California are you ... you say the ... we walked away from the time what was the highest law for paying law firm in the country to start my own practice back here in the Houston area and it's terrifying right it's terrifying to go from a\nGood check\nTo be an entrepreneur but that's in Texas where we don't have the hyper regulation that stifles entrepreneur realism that you have in California I don't know how anyone\nStarts a business in California today unless you are well money right unless it's some dot com thing and you're getting the vc money or\nYou know it's it's so regulated and employees have so many rights you know and and we obviously have a constitutional protections in statutory productions for for employees here but it's still at will employment state that just it's frightening\nYou know like I don't see and I think ... the California paradigm is how the left wants the entire country because they don't want us participating ultimately they just all want us giving a free check and being docile um how far along are you in starting your business or\nI've been working out for a little over a year and a half now and I don't foresee myself bringing any and on for about another year so I'm going to be on two and a half years without any yeah\nPut out a check from that\nNo no no I'll tell you like I recently of ... you know part of the first Bush started another business in may and it's always frightening it's always scary they need to there's always a ramp right where you have to be prepared and you have to work but\nWe have so many Americans just don't want to work anymore like how how many hours a week do you ah are you actually working on pushing the ball forward on your business or ... something else to pay you while you're doing that\nWell I Am working you know I get to work usually about six thirty every morning wire arrive at my office\nAnd then I'm usually there I've got a Cub Scout meeting a guy got you today I left a little bit early but yeah I'm putting in you know a good you know what I'm eating at my desk and everything I don't get up stakes smoke breaks or anything I'm usually I'm let's say that an hours a day\nAnd the office that in the evening and everything I'm you know work out stuff that house too so\nYeah they they can this I have a good life with a job that it's putting up with this\nWell no but I mean thank goodness for that and thank goodness that you you're you're still got an intact family you're participating in it but you know my my my son went all the way to the arrow of light and then just lost interest you know he was playing sports and stuff I think the Cub Scouts or the boy scouts are wonderful institution but\nI worked a lot to like I used to work all the time and my wife was actually the the the trooper the pack leader because I used to work all the time and just didn't have the time to do it but the new the goal of the left now is let's say you put the two and a half years and to make your money\nAnd you really start killing\nThey want to take all the money that you're making an redistributed to the rest of America or largely to the government bureaucracy to substitute and redistribute a portion of it to America and that's just insane I mean we should be paying our fair share of taxes to support our use of of a public services\nBut that's not America today America today is those of us to throw all throw caution to the winds start our own business and then when we start making real money\nWe've gotta give if you look at the ... over fifty percent if you include sales tax you include property tax if you include all the different ways the government gets tax money out of your pocket\nThose of us in what is considered the upper bracket or just getting killed and the reality is there's a huge difference between someone making several hundred thousand dollars a year and some of them making several million dollars a year but we're all treated the same the tax implications of success concern you at all or you just to driven to even worry about it\nSo we lost them well\nI I did enjoy your call Peter from Crosby I Am you\nKnow [noise]\nI think it's crazy I think it's crazy that in America today a brave American like that can be and go to and a half years without a check sink all of those times ten eleven hours a day into a new business\nAnd face the stark reality that once that business become successful the Democrats believe\nThat that success is owed to them and that success is owed to the non participate or some of the world and there really is if you're able bodied and you're an adult and you're starving\nThat's kinda on you know it sounds callous and cold but I don't\nHave a responsibility to support people but I don't want to support\nI don't want to live in America where we don't have food stamp assistance for children I don't want to live in America we're struggling mothers whose husbands have disgusting and we walked out on their family\nDon't have a vehicle over safety of a temporary safety net provided by the government\nBut I also don't want to live in America where the goal is to provide a permanent Dole for Americans to just don't care to get up every day and work and even if you are willing to get up every day and work with all you want to do is is\nFry French fries for McDonalds just what you shouldn't be able to buy a brand new suburban every three years you don't get to take your kids to Disney on that kinda money you\nWant to have things in America you should get them through hard work and dedication and figuring out a way to be a good employer or great entrepreneur\nThis is the land of opportunity it's not the land of the hand out this has been Charles Adams fill in Virginia we buried along with Chris little the greatest producer\nIn Houston talk radio talk I'm Talking directly to your mother Christmas better\nI'm bud loves emo music which really I mean and and now he's playing

I could have sworn you spoke to her before\nI let's say you know know that what you said last time when I had done junior on your watch it I really think that you had had done overseas oil you wouldn't Pablo sleep through every single show\nNot every single day every single one of your choice segment [laughter] whole of the other day two nights ago did a story on our earlier come on and so we ... you know\nAll although yesterday he remembered something that happened to the program and you didn't I Know there's something wrong with you know you like a neurosurgeon see what's going on today with a brand new book that we we have a Lara Trump on today Lara Trump she's the wife of Eric Trump\nShe's the daughter in law the president of the United states we have a great conversation about family the media\nHow did she react when the president said before he was the president I Will go for it and um\nOf course the midterms we've got to talk about that as well but have you seen her do interviews or like what what do you use in my position not being interviewed but she never ... I have not I didn't know she didn't actually good couldn't either I was like what the hell what's going on up and and I guess she used to work for a inside edition or something\nA ... named him or her father in law so that he was going to have no idea what she was in the media but she's really good I'm like so good I was like ... stop\nMe from ... from my review or so yeah it's a great conversation weapon for your bottom of our number two and we also have ... and she's from campus reforms which are really cool show but I Do want to get back to a story that we should have presented at the end of the show yesterday and I asked you if we could circle back to that we will talk about the caravan of people coming here\nThat's going to be a big deal heading to the mid term it it looks like it actually looks like they're timing it to get here in time for the midterms mhm which is a leftist thing to do there are questions now about who's financing it who's funding it who's pushing for it\nAnd I really think the left exist as somehow a winning deal for them if four thousand or more\nIllegal immigrants try to break through our our border\nIn terms of the midterm somehow there's going to help the left I have no idea how that would happen it would not help the left but I Do want to start with something off the beaten path that it's not breaking news and it's not news of the day but we'll get to the news of the day is a day goes on and again make sure you you can be for Lara Trump\nUm but I got to start with this story from yesterday there was a college somewhere university somewhere who um before you graduate is requiring you take a class in learning how to act when you have contact with police and I think this is a really really good idea Caribbean Ken let's go back to that from yesterday ...\nActually a high school during the blaze since high school students to ship Leno watching video about conducting themselves around police officers if they want to graduate from high school and your taxes on mandates and high school students at hue and video on to fusing tensions between civilians and law enforcement\nAnd the community than the Education Act was signed into law in two thousand Seventeen and requires it all high school students watched the video tape the corresponding class on proper conduct when dealing with officers in the laundering traffic stop texting senator rights of West authored legislation in an attempt to find the expectations of law enforcement and citizens during traffic stops\nAt school seniors will not being able to graduate if they did not fill this fulfilled this requirement according to the new law\nAnd the video titled flashing lights utilizes reenactment to law enforcement officials in citizens engaging one another\nAnd then he includes pointers such as don't move around to reach for anything other directives include officers don't always have the clear view into your vehicle to keep your hands visible and let the opposite you know if you're reaching into the console\nAnd their training video also offers tips to educate citizens on their rights because whether they must get out of the car or decline of an officer request to search the vehicle and it's also broken into four distinct parts which include the road line for Smith citizens writes proper behavior and filing a complaint\nAnd the Texas commission on law enforcement produced a video and collaborated on content with the department of licensing and rank right regulation as well as the state board of education West is featured in the video is at the content was specifically\nDesigned to ensure a bond of trust between officers and citizens\nI think it's smart I Am not for more laws are not for more regulation is a month for a government overreach\nBut I think there's as intelligent I I actually compare this to carry you probably had this when you were in high school to pull you probably did to stand by the time you and it probably wasn't available we'll find out you guys think economics in high school did you take like personal economics\n... how to writing check yes and how\nTo manage down now I think that that's why you guys are ... style that you know [laughter] oh boy did you take that that class in high school\nI don't think I did but I remember learning how to do that in some class and I'm not sure what class it was but I don't know if it was an economics class\nI mean I won't say which daughter it is and it's not Sam\nAnd it's not CJ snow day is not Mesa out I won't say which got rid of this terrible [laughter] would but I Would have to say that this that I've got at least one daughter has no clue how you pay rent has no clue how electric gets paid ... there's no clue how the Internet works has no clue how you would be things just are semi right or wrong or whether things just are\nYou're definitely right yes they just are oh at the car still goes will have the gasket in there I'm not sure what it's in there\nWas an as free as are aghast ferry at night or something and and the answer is no but I really truly an ... actually even make it more specific I think that athletes\nShould\nBefore they sounded first contract like athletes are going to make a lot of money doing it\nShould have to sit down mandatory by the NFL or a major league baseball or NBA or whichever league is it is sit them down and teach them how to manage their money ... you know give them some sort of crash course in personal economics how many people that have won the lottery do we now know or\nOr they're just out of money on their time down there on road yeah right\nSame thing with for athletes as soon as the money train stops that's it\nThey're out of money they were making ten million a year it doesn't make any sense so we should have that sort of class that sort of a a\nIt's almost a rite of passage in life on some level of education before you leave this is the future what if he tried to write a check for the future when I ask what is the first lesson security mean well how do you get gas in the car how does the Internet work I think we need a basic course on\nLiving life and how things work but I mean they're leaving thing here with the boys but\nDoesn't even matter anymore about checks though I mean there's nobody really uses checks anymore I Know that people will pay tax\nBut on the lower class polo would be a check card or a card vet is that it's associated with a bank account yes and again I won't say which daughter [noise] but I've got at least one that believes it's unlimited\n[laughter] and and you know what I think they should also show or teach kids how to shop grocery shop\nI could not agree more because somehow they're always groceries in the house right 'cause there's an groceries or grocery ferry that comes at three o'clock in the last ... and fills up the the the ... century and the refrigerator\nIt to me I just think that these are basic things that we sometimes take for granted so exactly the same way with police when I get pulled over by a police officer which rarely ever happens\nOr don't lie to the people you say you learn about them do not lie in the last\nTime the airline is probably the memorial and and this morning\nI Do have to say hello to officer Smith [laughter] I wouldn't be safe out there wasn't this morning but um\nI've been pulled over by police and I'm more times than not don't get the citation not because they know who I Am or something like that would be some animal and heard we double mhm no it isn't just never ever done it you know just to let you know pass on the radio\nOn your radio or one means like a muscle okay have you had been the muscles help um I generally speaking will get out of the ticket

hour I've got Joe Jennifer we got Rudy we've got\nA where we have great ...\nAnd she's on the stump the midterms are almost a year less than ... ...\nTwo two and a half weeks away now and are working hard to make sure the message get the message gets out there and people understand if you don't vote to keep the Congress\nSupportive of the president than all the good things that he's done will will not necessarily go by the wayside but it'd be hard to continue this great progress that we're making of the country I talked to her about family I talked to her about how she reacted when she heard the president that her father in law was going to run for president of the United states\nI mean they're just great topics that we go down Melissa how nasty the media's become and much much more make sure you stick around bottom of this hour for Lara Trump 'em by the way you're watching Newsmax TV President Trump is in Montana\nAnd um and he'll be giving a speech and I think at eight thirty eastern they're gonna run that speech on ... on TV so stick around for that so there's a lot going on a lot that we want to get to but I've got a phone calls lined up for a topic I was talking about right before the break and actually for much of the last hour in between the Michael McDonald impersonation which again spot on\n'em and just to see ...\nI can but not in this case and I am before but when you ever have to be honest\nAh think so uh eat ice on it now I Do think about that in a while [laughter] okay\nDaily something nice for one packs a day nine four one Seventy four seven and and the question was\nIs it a good idea 'cause they're they're doing this in in one school at least an open they're doing more to have a class teaching students how to deal with police when they make contact with police officers on the street I said it's a great idea and I wonder where you are on this and we go to the phone lines can be Rudy in San Antonio Rudy what's going on\nOh Mike please oh let's just say hey\nWhat is what is wrong with you really want ... who is Michael McDonald [laughter] oh I was going around them telling\nYou he was so supportive of my body will be the only person they didn't even get it ready library she that wrote at what's going on the\nSame old same old brother a a\nA little so what's that [laughter]\nYou know [laughter] you know you you [laughter] you know ...\n... from what I've been told an Enron is a is a sharp shooter or something I don't I don't really know that is otherwise what who's been rod\n... he was back in the way back in the times that no he was a it was a king ah who ah who ah he did something to offend God in\nGod or did something to him and his people and he made them talk different languages that's why we talked the language that everybody does\nNow see you don't want to be in them rod exactly right that's what I'm saying to call somebody named rod to negative good now what are you doing these classes my friend\nOr you know what I think I think they need to because up I mean if you're going to be acting stupid and what ... what have you not when they pull you over I mean you're gonna you're gonna talk yourself into a ticket every time you know when I said you know I Try yeah whenever I get out\nI always tell them Yes sir no sir I Need to your best guess sir Yes sir I got I got everything right here give it to them you know talk to them as friendly as I can you know maybe BS with them a little bit yeah and most of the times I'll let you go but you know if you've got something wrong with your vehicle or whatever you know they'll say hey man you need to get this ...\nThere's a second oh okay I've got to pass it on this All right thanks or have a nice day right you know\nIf and if you at like ... ... you know real nice to be able to let you go just give you a warning statement you'll get that fix or if you this that they'll do that\nNo I agree with that many many times that's exactly how it will go down and uh it was interesting about it is you're you're you've all I've often anyway heard but the comment from a cop you've now talk to your way into a ticket not for me but for other people and I\nAnd and all you do is be respectful shut your face realize that they're human beings and their job is pretty stressful and and generally speaking you're going to be pretty good to you\nExactly I mean if you act like an ass that's how you're going to get treated\nExactly ... brother All right we appreciate your Rudy thank you I'm a editing nine for one pack so he was so good with the with the Michael but getting into the only way over your head\nAnd you don't like it was ... it was my own joke and I didn't get it I didn't make any sense or let me very quickly go to a ... a comics coming on one more call in the police quest and then when we come back Kerry will have ah the update on the caravan coming from Central America\nAre looking at once they hit through Mexico here to our borders just in time for the midterms if you can believe that Terry what's on your mind high\nTide go hey\nHey Joe you there yeah man come on let's let's do it\nUh well listen I got a couple of things on the the classified yet but also I wanted to tell you I'm surprised the other guy that called in from Minnesota didn't let you know but uh there's a town in Minnesota called Enron so\nYeah a lot of people have been telling me on Twitter I I didn't know that but I Do know that that's cool\nYeah I had an old girlfriend from there but uh\nHey what happened what happened in a relationship well hold on what happened [laughter]\nAnd just fizzle by like if\nYou ever did she break up or did you break up I mean seriously what was the problem\nYou know what it's quite a while and I don't remember Kerry don't let her know they're always on them for the liberal ... who doesn't want to know we want to know what happened with Enron\nProbably something stupid I did so\nThat's what she told us that I knew I was just wonder if you're going on over through it she told us as what happened now we know\nThere's too many things that I Can't remember\nExactly right that's what she said she said it was numerous stuff yeah\n[laughter] [laughter] exactly but I don't get me about this about this police glass\nOkay I think that is an incredible idea because um I moved back to Minnesota from\nAnother state yeah in which I had taken a concealed carry class right and in in the class they had told us that um\nWhen the officer pulls up your plate and pulls you over they are showing that you're a concealed carry weapon license to write and uh\nSo they come up a little on the edge already so just knowing that and I mean in the class they taught us you know put your hands up there like you said it right too and and ...\nAnd but they didn't say you know put your window all the way down which I like that idea that you had right and also put your light on inside which which they didn't say and also it's a\nEven a bigger point right now with everybody with Ken and windows and a lot of them with illegally tenet window right you know and actually the back seats being especially dark you know you can have darker levels on the back seats they can't even see in\nSo I Would suggest people even put those down so the officer hasn't view there and\nI yeah I I went to ... I'm also an L. P. C. guy which is a license to carry in Texas they used to be the job and now it's L. D. C. and what I Do and what they instruct you to do when you take the classes is to hand your\nDriver's license injure handgun license with you or to the police officer down to let him or her know that uh that in fact they weren't having that carries a gun and again if you're ... you're in plain sight I've never had a cop say well give me the gun\nI mean that's never happened when they said it was like where is it and I was right here in my right side by side or it's of my control or whatever and then there and then there Kobe understand\nRight and that's what I said you know it I Do have a concealed carry I've got the a pistol loaded and then my glove box or something like that you know and then I leave it to them for the next\nStatement or the next order but um I don't know if you remember there was a couple of high profile cases here in Minnesota\nAh where people got shot and killed\nAnd ah one of them was this plan to cast hill\nRight now is that none of those are big national elaborate right\nOh yeah and whether the cop was acting properly or not or within his training or not which they said he was in there weren't charter right quick for the top you know if I hadn't done what we're talking about here in college\nNever would have happened he was fumbling around there was something in his lap I mean to do it again if you if you go through a specific protocol I'm going to make contact with police I have a handgun license I have a gun on me I mean my hands are in plain sight how's it going officer I don't know why people have to be so on edge over time I appreciate you Terry got around here um but ... again\nI Do believe that it's a very simple process to teach younger people here's how you active\nAnd right just and it's the right thing to do so\nI I Am Ninety five percent sure this is far left wing maybe even cirrhosis funded because they think if they get your body election but this will rally Democrats or does your one open borders and wants the legal system to go vote and go and vote left it would be ridiculous for Republicans ... ...\nDot com more Trump when we come back right here with Joe ... show\nYou know I Would actually behind the camera I was a producer with with inside edition yeah for five years before\nI actually took time off and then ended up leaving to help my father in law's campaign on so I was on the other side of things but you know what I think if you're passionate about something ran and you know you're out there speaking the truth and and doing the right thing it and come easily\nWas you know I had Eric I'm a couple of days ago I had done junior on the last week or something I heard your father in law and seven times\nAnd we're trying to get the message out the best we can this mid term that we're heading into Laura ... just a little bit much to me because I'm seeing polling that shows that it's very close between Democrats and Republicans and when things are going so well in the country as they are\nDo you think that it's people who are are planning to go and vote ... pollsters you'd think they don't realize that\nIf it should go to the left all the good things that are happening right now would come to a halt\nWhile I knocked me right I Hope people are paying attention I think they are I think people ... and vote or if they were going to vote in these midterm thought the Kavanaugh confirmations ...\nThe apple just spray that was you know what if you want to know what the Democrats stand for there is a perfect picture of it right there to read I think a lot of Republicans a lot of women saw that and we're ... and buy it and said I Am getting out I'm voting in the mid term elections I'm going to volunteer I'm going to help\nOut there is nothing more important that people can do and vote in these midterm elections if you're happy with the death of the country under President Donald Trump people come up to me all the time and they all your father in law thank you the best way to thank him to get out and vote for Trump supporting Republicans in the mid term election\nOtherwise like you just said you know all the forward progress in another country all the great thing that we've seen happen come to a screeching halt and not only that but make no mistake about it but Democrats will do everything they can do teach this part of that\nThey have no real ... other than resist obstruct and quite frankly socialism at this point which should scare everybody to that\nUm it it's so important for the future of this country for the foreign progress of the president's agenda to get out and vote in the\nTerms it's lower Trump but we love Heather on each as Laura Lee Trump on Twitter regime that's correct L. E. A. by now and they\nUnderstand I follow you and your husband million I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow those will probably be buying more it's fun to buy that\nOkay I appreciate it um you know traditionally you bring up Kevin I've been told him to the cabinet bounds but it happened so early that I feel like things might pull down before the midterms in ... dying and Feinstein yesterday what gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into you know justice Kevin Oh Laura she said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because we saw how crazy they got during the actual confirmation process\nIf it's really terrifying it is finally showing their true colors that Democrats they really don't stand for much except trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think that you eat so much with resistance out there\nIs because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone who's down or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is waiting for the country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life is over\nAs they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC well not go in and and voting on behalf of their constituents though and make them scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's doing this because he loves his country to hold him to\nAnyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before\nUm which is all the more reason that we need all the Republicans support we can in Congress\nThat is a large role but really great to talk to your brother in law I asked him ... I asked her husband is the President Bush\nOf woods you may be announcements I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this ... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but\nHis love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like your mother in law was really going to take the stuff", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jesse Kelly Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "18"}
