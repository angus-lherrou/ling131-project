our program but we also don't mix freaked out shelters all of our dogs are right around ... hell that eighty to Ninety pounds and they're all less than two years old because they want him to have a long serving life for the men and women that they're serving\nWow what a difference you're baking thank you again for joining us we should do appreciate the best of luck shut and I'm sure we'll talk he didn't take care\nThank you so much thank you for like have a great day\nJenna Walker northwest battle buddies that or do put that up on our Facebook page by the way oh so you can link up with that if you want um you know just trying to help around while twenty five thousand dollars\nYou ... it takes months and months and months and months and months of training plus and veterans have to work with the DOJ themselves so it takes a lot of work in order to be able to make that happen\nGood for her though I mean I I Love what she's doing and if I could feel for I mean she's in the Pacific northwest for goodness sakes I mean she's surrounded\nBy or and and you know\nSeattle you know a lot of\nPlaces that the that they they just don't get the sacrifice that our veterans making some of those places they they really do believe that um\nYou know far more than our first responders and veterans suffer from Pete TST they just throw the term around so it really doesn't seem to mean much to them\nAs much as the scale I was involved with the emergency chaplain group or was it was quite a thing to be a part of\nAnd I was invited emcee at night I enjoyed it I met a lot of listeners there I'm at congressman Kevin Brady are met a lot of other of the local politicians who are there you know who's served the women's area where I happen to live\nAnd um and help raise I think by the end of the evening the they'd raised over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this organization which is good because we need to keep this going aid is amazing the stress\nTheir first responders go to I think we have a tendency to think that there used to some of the things that they see that when they show up at a at a fire and there are the people who've lost their lives as something there used to they show up at a traffic accident in there is a a a a brutal accident where somebody is has died there's some other there used to that\nI don't think I'm normal human beings ever get used to that\nOr many other things they did they most of them feel like they have a\nCalling uh most of them are are more than happy to make the sacrifices that they make up to their family life\nIn order to be able to do the job that they felt they were born to do I think the least we can do to support them and give them some of the tools that they need in order to be able to cope and and that's what the gale is all about there's a couple of things that really stuck out about that gala to be\nOne of them was the was the keynote speaker was a guy who um whose life completely changed remember the story that Southwest Airlines like uh the one where\nIt had a a critical engine failure on takeoff from La Guardia and a part of that engine went through one of the passenger windows and\nKnocked out the window a woman who\nWas sitting in that seat got sucked out of the airplanes were almost sucked out of the airplane I mean she was half over was outside of the airplane she did not\nSurvive this but one of the people who came to the rescue was a Texas firefighter who just happen to be on board the plane and it was interesting to hear him tell the story of what they had the experience was like but I found it much even much more interesting\nTo hear him tell the story about how difficult it's been to cope with this incident ever since it happened because it his case it wasn't it wasn't about the call to action there doing what he was trained to do is what it was like after that\nYou know the calls from media all across the country you know being invited along with the pilots\nTo come to the White House\nWith some of the other crew members and beating the president of being in the oval office I mean I suppose that's a great thing about it but the constant harassment from the media for interviews the the inability to the loss of your privacy or you could tell\nYou could tell what sort of a toll it'd take it on him personally and on his family to a certain extent\nAnd you can see where all the stress comes from you know this is a guy who he's not used to that kind of attention he wasn't the sinking that kind of attention he had a hard time figuring out how to cope with that kind of attention\nAnd um he's one of the people who got help by emergency Chaplin group\nIs they recognized almost instantly in him what they see all the time with the firefighters of first responders they help you know I think they counseled him\nAnd I think they did them a whole heck of a lot of good so it's important to to work with these organizations it was the seventh annual hope for heroes gala and the\nIt was an order to be a part of it and um and to and to try to help this worthwhile cause\nSomething else I Want to mention the biggest kick I got out of that gala\nIs is is there was just a truth Texas moment I felt they had a they had an auction\nWith a great auction or ... I don't know how they talk is I don't really talk as best they talk whole areas to me it's really entertaining to watch a good option here do his thing but they had a they had the uh\nA grab a whole variety of different uh items that they were doing a live option on where you could bid on them right there on the spot\nIs always fun to watch people get into a bidding war with something or how some things really sell if something's really do some things go for a little bit of money maybe a whole lot less than you thought they were to go forward and then other things go for a whole lot more than you thought they were going to go forward in the thing that that that that really struck me were two items they were there were\nAuction off back to back one was an American flag donated by congressman that had flown over the U.S Capitol you know they put those up all the time\nThat one went for three hundred dollars right after that was a Texas flag that has loaned over the state Capitol in Austin\nThat went for two thousand three hundred dollars three hundred for the U.S flag twenty three hundred for the Texas like what does that tell us about Texas pride what does that tell us about how we feel about our state compared to anything else\nReally quite amazing [noise] but for everybody participated in that and he'll say the organization of thank you so much fail\nI'll be back tomorrow morning five data and bright and early on Katie or H\nA share his off tomorrow so uh we'll do something different tomorrow morning John latest fulfilling for or they'll see\nBack here tomorrow afternoon at three on K PR see the greatest thing [noise]\n[noise]\n... gallery furniture made in America studio\nAn accused killer in cork I only had like ... Fox News you can add it with already said gunned down in that in people that have ... Pittsburgh makes his first court appearance Fox has gotten off Scott has more live\nU.S attorneys got ...

old man and a fifty five year old officer we're in critical condition\nAnd Pittsburgh public safety director window has tricks to the attack a tree of life wasn't one of the worst crime scenes he never seen\nSo it's sick I mean nobody who's a a good person and most of us are the vast majority of us are very good people nobody watch this nobody hopes that this happens I'm ... and instead of coming up as soon as I was I haven't seen any solutions from anybody\nNot since Parkland not since Columbine you were to go back even further I mean or further it doesn't make any sense why there's always this political slant there should be no politics involved when innocent people are going down driven over stab to fill in the blank\nSomebody's doing bad things to good people we as a society should come together and say here's what we have to do\nAnd you see I mean Twitter is just a microcosm but you see on on you know social media or it's not too soon to talk about gun control not too soon to talk about what reasonable a logical gun laws and then when you ask him a very simple question what exactly is the gun law\nThat you want to put in place that would have prevented a bad guy from doing bad things to good people\nAnd you never get a good answer because there is no good answer\nThe answer is\nWe must protect ourselves at the point where the bad people think they can get away with it\nSays in politics this was larger than common sense what's going to\nDeter bad gosh I'm going to a soft target you'll notice he didn't show up at you know a an army base you notice he didn't show up at a police station we showed up at a synagogue where you would expect nobody's carrying guns they're worried about worship into worried about you know praying to God and having to you\nOther you know togetherness with their community it happened at the movie theater in Aurora it happens at every school that people go to it happens that it happened in Sutherland Springs of the church there I mean that's the fact\nSo what solutions had been offered up by anybody while the president says we need armed security they should have been um security there and he's been lambasted I dare you say that well because armed security may have stopped this guy from killing anybody\nNo it's not the the synagogues fold clearly and I'm not suggesting that it is but at some point knowing that this is happens knowing that there is a\nEven a remote possibility that it can happen it's time to say we must do something to protect to protect the innocence\nAnd what do you do well who stopped him\nThe police stopped them\nThe numbers are what carried killed eleven for police officers injured yes people total intern\nSo\nHow many more people were there do we know I don't know how many more ... died had the police not shown up and had a shootout with this guy the guy was injured by police I kinda wish they'd have killed him but he was injured by police and now the prosecutors will seek the death penalty on this piece of garbage good there should be a death penalty for a piece of garbage like this but having said all of that\n\nThe good guys with guns stopped the bad guy with a gun or several guns they stopped him it was the good guys they did it and we want to pretend like that isn't that is somehow a deterrent for people who know that there's a good guy with a gun there that's why there should be marshals in churches are schools\nThere should be marshals at at the synagogue or at the mall of course there should be an air marshals on planes ever since nine eleven we we had some before\nBut never really got them and it's a deterrent it's smart its hedging your your bets you know most police officers never even draw their guns\nOn the job well I wouldn't say that maybe they draw the gun but most don't ever shoot their firearm well on the job and that's good so the odds are they never will but when you have to it's been good you got it\nIt doesn't make any sense to look at it from any other angle and I'm so sick and tired of you had some idiot on CNN\nWho actually said the president has radicalized more people than ISIS she had to come back in the next segment on CNN and apologize for being so stupid I Want to apologize that wasn't in factual I set it because I'm frustrated and I have a reason to be frustrated she attacked him store\nBut to say that and to put it out there and who shut the TV off after the commercial break you know who who didn't hear her correct it it's just a matter of saying whatever you think will play right now\nAnd I'm not here to play I'm here to tell you we have to be smart about protecting ourselves do I want a society where we can keep our front doors unlocked yes do I want a society where you can keep the car running when you're at the convenience store to keep it you know warm in the winter recall in the summer Yup I want that\nBut the fact is if you leave your front door and lock your you're inviting people if you leave your car running while you run in the store you're inviting people to do bad things it's still on the bad guy bad guy still shouldn't be a bad thing doesn't make you more alive doesn't meet your car and you less stolen\nYour should you be able to carry money uh you know in your front car seat yeah and nobody should mess with it if it's not theirs but chances are you're inviting somebody to do it why when I go anywhere that I Do I take my expensive writer attacked her and I take it off the windshield\nAnd I put it somewhere where people can't see it now would it be the bad guys fault if he stole it yes\nBut I just wanted to take an extra step of precaution to make sure he doesn't know what's in there is no reason to bother my car\nI don't like living like that but we do and when you say things like you know there should be armed security at churches synagogues mosques fill in the blank and people's reaction is I don't want to live like that what is it martial law what are we going to buy some martial law it's being smart\nThe bad guys are striking go through any number of these shootings that have happened the bad guys were striking where they know there's the path of least resistance that's what's happening I mourn\nFor these people in Pittsburgh and to blame the president is sick I'm not sitting you're blaming Brock Obama who is a serious gun control guy I'm not blaming him for this\nHalf year old boy from wheels sweet yeah now you're going to hurt us mhm or set of Trump's tweets are you just do Trump tweet yeah you could do that to probably do that and looked at\n\nLike even trumped we\nDid it is it losing it is I have a tweet went on a bad I Can't just want to eat a little bit encourage the heritage of this ten hours ago there was great anger in our country caused it in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open in um obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame\nOf anger and outrage\nAnd we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony fake news most in\nBill\nI ask you what you an accurate about bad why why would have been Shapiro have a problem with that tweet\nI don't get it\nYou didn't see the media\nIs the enemy of the people who didn't say good news is the enemy of the people\nI read it I just not ready to change did he change change I did he\n\nTwitter your kids sort of it after you posted it he said be fake news media\nNow I'm going to suggested allege that when Ben Shapiro do something that is factual and and based on real news he's not the fake news media are not to fake news media I base my opinions on solid fact this irrefutable so I'm not to fake news media\nCarries on the fake news media Kerry make sure that what she's saying which reports is accurate\nThat is what we expect it she doesn't amazing job of it so that's not carry what he says they do you feel like you said you're the enemy of the people\nAnd now I don't\nAs you are not going to call yourself fake news media ... so do you have an opinion as to why people are getting that wrong\nI don't know why I don't know why some people are upset about that and why they want him to stop\nI Believe I'm going to say it I Believe the fake news media is the enemy of the people what you report that the president didn't visit Steve ... in the hospital and either personally or they're visiting him at the time\nThat's bad and misleads people therefore I think is the enemy of the people when you show a picture of Republicans and Democrats praying\nAt second base and you report that this was a picture of Democrats praying that's fake news that's not real that's inaccurate will you base any reporting whatsoever\nOn this fraudulent dust da\n... fake piece of garbage that was used against Pfizer warrants and to serve veil the Ben I'm\nCandidate Donald Trump that's fake news media and that is the enemy of the people that you're reporting things to people as crews and it's not\nYour the fake news media why why can't somebody like that to be called out I Would think they can be I Would if it gets right just to do so or eight eight nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy two four seven eight jak\n\nJoe but my brother I got about a minute for ya okay big daddy a wreck quick you know I'm tired of them\nThat they can do things that we can't do things and what we do we call him out on the fake stuff that they do right but it never seen a Republican doing with the Democrats still at a ... a whole grilled said\nWait guy let's we are all that kind of crap and all the Indian chemical and say no Republican has to do that you know and the best part about it and look out gas or whatever it is the ...\nAnd ... and it got passed we can't\nDo the right guy by the way I saw your video at ... you were a great\nOh man it was pretty awesome to be a motel and like I say three waves come they don't let that fake news media take us out of the like twenty six teams\nEverybody get shipped by is that at a vote because it's ... it's an invasion hey we got to stop playing games and we use that word ...\nNobody feeling is that probably what it really is I mean and what has such a new car they what they say ought to go they love your\nShow called ...\n\n\nHave you\nRead the Joe ... show radio stations all over [noise] job X. dot com for Facebook\nTwitter Instagram email the live video feed is there as well make sure you stop by glad to have you long for the ride that is Carrie lucky carry how's it going\nAnd going fine how are you\nRight in the middle of a ... so ... what kind of a relationship is this now I again I don't know much about your politics we've never had a political discussion off here [noise] um I don't know Mario's politics are never had that kind of discussion go than we've ever talked about his football and it's what a pain you are\nBut and it's not on that as my husband will never ever saying that about me now well you know he said that you would not be in any way yeah we actually he's so now those exact words so anyway um\nWould you be able to be married to somebody who disagrees with you a lot ... probably not politics and social issues on just sold in the blank begin with you I think he\nI don't know I Can't imagine a name for a very good marriage but I'm going to say no and eventually kitchen and I\n... I Hope the Kellyanne Conway and her husband have an incredible marriage but why don't you keep doing this stuff\n'cause he not only works I think he does [laughter] think he that he knows where she goes to work right mhm and say yeah I Know is the\nPresident Trump pretty much says she's the reason he want ... what is your what is he doing I ... ... what is what is barrio everyday did an op ed in like the local newspaper complaining about your news coverage\n[noise] and then we have some problems ... yeah ... yeah\nYeah I mean rightfully so\nIt's just a I don't know how to make sense between the two give me the story from the hills\nA from a White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been encouraged what another Twitter user described as a pile on over\nIn terms of taxing the media ... George Conway egging on criticism and trying to Monday tweet calling the media to true enemy of the people\nOn Monday and blamed the media for great anger in our country and a tweet falling all weekend politically charged gambling violent\nReferred to the fake news media and the true enemy and the people\nAnd that kind of life was one of Trump's top aides aren't paid leave ... the president on Twitter I'm selling criticizing him through a retreat in critical stories Monday three has garnered significant criticism particularly as it comes out the series of pipe bombs are now to prominent Democrats and CNN and after a shooting that might eleven that any Pittsburgh synagogue\nAnd Trump condemned the mail bombs and shooting ... that has rejecting calls to tone down his rhetoric\nI mean what does what does he do in\nMy mind it to be very odd and again look I don't know him I Know Kellyanne I've known her for a long time but I don't know him I mean in ... in my aren't like personal friends were like hanging out I Know her professionally and I have for a long time since the CNN days\nAnd I just don't understand why I mean look he couldn't believe that of course he can he's American he can he can say that to his friends and in a circle and and he can certainly do what he's doing now he's allowed to but it does raise questions why would you want to and\nI don't think that it's an overstatement saying that either they're misleading on purpose the very smart people that are saying that he's ... stop attacking the fake news media\nOr they're really really dumb I don't think Kellyanne Conway says it's dumb and again I don't know and but I have to imagine it's a pretty smart guy so is he purposely misleading people because there is no\nAttack on everybody in the media there is no attack on the news media\nAge the fake news media those that are making it up as they go and purposely misleading there's nothing wrong with the president going after them and saying stop it let's come together as Americans it's very strange that this guy did then I went and checked out his Twitter account and he's re tweeting all sorts of people complaining that the president\nI don't get it it would be a it'd be difficult honey I'm homemade let's talk about anything\nThat I go to great you know what I mean what are you saying I don't know it doesn't sound very happy\nIt's going to I I don't know it's a and an eight nine four one pegs editing nine four one seven two four seven let's talk about logical solutions to stop what we saw happen in a in that synagogue let's let's let's really have that discussion\nLet's talk about how we can stop this game of the second amendment needs to go away it was about ... or the second amendment needs to go away because you don't need more than\nTwo bullets to shoot it here in San about that it's about protecting our freedoms and liberties and the founding fathers are smart enough to make sure there was a mechanism in place that would allow us to do just that\nBut what solution if you're the decider what solutions when you come up with right now and by the way if you're a lefty that really does believe gun control and more gun laws will somehow solve the problem I'm listening\nBirthdays babies first steps graduations weddings the holidays all of those important moments you have an old camcorder tapes photos in film legacy box converge them all to digital files\nWhen I'm On a thumb drive a DVD or even convenient digital download for you to easily watching\nShare with your family legacy boxes offering you because you listen to my show forty percent off at legacy box dot com slash bags legacy box dot com slash bags get forty percent off right now you've got to go to a legacy box dot com slash bags\nTo get this great deal\n\n\nWhat's the phase\nOut on the huge metal room\n... may be better if I knew the words of mailing it not really nailed it had to like ...\n... ... well you know the thing is You're welcome\n... nobody's thinking they weren't going to work on that false ...

gonna be an for Shaun what's going on high\nHey Joe REO living the dream act which I have a\nA a so two points one um [noise] uh there's not a news story today about a bad guy who ah rammed into McDonalds or started shooting up the place down in Alabama and a good guy with the gun stopped the bad guy with a gun so\nSure did yeah we're gonna we're gonna read the whole story next hour without a doubt yeah the the good guy with a gun killed the bad guy protected as family protected the people in at McDonald's the bad guy walked in shooting what do you do them well luckily somebody was there with a gun\nAt exactly right so then that leads to the second point that you know unfortunately this\nSad story in Pittsburgh but it's a first time this has happened and uh you know for for me anyways um I started you know I have my my concealed carry permit and I've been carrying now for the last couple of years every Sunday when I go to church and I know I'm not the only one\nWho does that and it's it's just insurance right um you hope you never have to use it but you thank God you have it when you when you do\nExactly right and you hope you never want to eat it but you never end abusing it I don't wanna shoot anybody I don't want to be in a in a gunfight but if it comes down to you're gonna you're gonna go get a a cheeseburger with your family and you might die I think that it's good to know that you've got somebody there who can protect you\nExactly right\nDie brother I appreciate it yeah I Know that that's that stories not making it on the big news I mean it's out there people who seemed on social media um but it's not getting the kind of coverage that you might expect it to get especially so close after this or the shooting up the synagogue because it really does make the point that a good guy with a gun\nYou know can actually help\nThat's true that's the case\nEight eight nine four one bags editing nine four one Seventy four seven Joe ... dot com we go back out to see how to Kevin who's in Houston Kevin what's going on I\n[noise] I make Jell O and high chair\nYeah hair I although I don't I don't think anybody has her care [laughter]\nWhere's that scary guy where I wouldn't yeah\nYeah they should ban carry a I'm a carrier and you're ... you're in Texas to write San Antonio yeah\nOkay well you know um we got off on the on\nWhat are we going to do to stop all this stuff with with everything they they answers as as what your guest said it's very simple we're actually going to stop the guy with the guy the guy with a gun is going to stop the bad guy where they got the like in Portland these antibodies are messing with all these people because they don't have guns well\nIf you're at an intersection in Houston you come down the Internet and he's anti fish or wind the road you're going to have ten bombers come out of their trucks for three fifty Simon's yeah ends or fifty is right and you know what they are better at work here that's your answer right there\n... well I I agree with you but you have to understand but can you get the far left who sues indoctrinated people to believe ... not the right answer you need more laws you need more gun control how do we how do we you know get these people out of their their hypnotic states they make them understand this is actually pretty simple\nIt didn't allow concealed carry let that sink in now why would have done that it's actually pretty simple he did that because he knew nobody will be shooting back\nOkay\nAt Sutherland Springs the bad guy chose a target where he was confident there was nobody with a gun thankfully Steven will offer was not far any chased him down and stopped what might have turned out to be two hundred people killed\nVirginia Tech the police on campus were called and they responded they did a good job responding but they weren't able to react\nThere was a Seventy something year old professor who had survived the Holocaust who was killed as he was trying to block the door to keep the bad guy out and keep the bad guy from harming his students do you think about that\nWhat if that guy has a gun the teacher the professor at least he has a fighting chance right so we're acting like there isn't a solution there is\nThe left will continue to say now is the time to talk about sensible gun legislation now's the time to talk about sensible gun laws we have to fundamentally change or this that and the other yet they've never once given a valid\nIdea or what a bill should look like that's let's ban assault weapons ... assault weapon well\nIt's a it's a weapon where you pull the trigger all the ... that's automatic will learn someone automatic weapons out here\nWhere I was semi automatic the same thing no it's not well we should\nBan a big magazines skinhead my big coal clips ... clip why what's that going because you only have two boats to shoot a beer or does what does that go there so I'm not sure I understand that solves we should have laws that people can't get by guns anymore okay then only the bad guys all have the guns because the good guys by them legally\n\nDo when you talk about better background checks on people who have known criminal records or histories like the bad guy partly by and promised pray I thought the promise program is a minority you have to make sure he has a chance at life well there were Seventeen people in Parkland for now don't have a chance because of him\nBecause of the allowance of scrubbing a criminal record which should have been obvious to anybody when this guy tried to buy a gun\nSo I said I said this last hour they can get one gal got what's called Vegas even one called that took took my offer call and tell me what it is you're on the left your anti Second Amendment you want more gun laws what is the what is the gun law look like\nThat solve this problem because I Want you to remember what the intent was and remains of the second amendment being tend to the second amendment is not to shoot it here it is not to take target practice the tend to the second amendment is to prevent\nAny tyrannical government to again do with England did to to the colonies to the people here to stop them from ever telling them how to worship how much taxes they were\nGoing to have to pay for tea they owe to the stamp taxing over and over they they went rogue and went nuts and then started telling people you don't really own this place I Do it started to try to disarm the people and we're going to have a warrant show use boss\nAnd the people who came here came here for freedom and liberty they came here to have religious freedoms and and to be able to be in the press to report on things and to be able to\nTo have a gun to prevent the government from ever over running them again read the entirety of the of the declaration of independence it goes very in depth as to how we're not going to have this happen again\nAnd here we are with a loud minority but a loud minority of people in this country who are going on and on and on about how the constitution is at its antiquated the second amendment needs to be getting ... to ... take it out now they meant mosque is they didn't mean these weapons of war weapons of or\nDidn't mean those didn't mean those\nSo I Want to hear your thoughts I Want to hear somebody give me a valid answer and you're on the left okay we'd get rid of the second amendment that'll solve the problem by filling the blank or we come up with a piece of legislation of bill it looks like this well let's say\n\nYou're very sort of a press the button and the button just now mhm\nSome got treated me earlier he said if you ever wonder if people steal things from you from your show the answer is yes and then I press plays little piece of video of some guy on the radio doing girl ... now his voice was about as deep as yours\nSo it didn't have the same effect ... but he still did that I think it was like a music DJ so so yeah there you go see I'm I'm affecting other people in the industry it's what I hear I Am in a in a pacemaker plural nature center or a\nA trend that person or a training center ...\nYou know center so speaker\nNow so [laughter] it's ...

during the summer of say in this sort of is a microcosm of what I've been saying which is the left really does believe\nThat more laws that's the answer help me out here\nFrom the blaze Pittsburgh the Democratic mayor Dale ... said on meet the press Sunday that he doesn't believe that more armed guard that places of worship are the answer and at the appropriate response to Saturday's mass murder the tree of lines sending out in Pittsburgh is more gun control\nGo home and cook pace because they said guns are not allowed here I didn't have when you're going to guide never I never said which is that\nWhat what I said was if I'm a bad guy and I want to go I Want to go Rob a convenience store one convenience store has a sign that says we have for employees here that I'll have guns\nAnd the other convenience stores says no guns allowed ... now you gotta now you've got to dump 'em polo and on television or did you read that in time or not but you know you knew that Franklin was going to go there\nYou know that he was going to go there and actually tried to recall him but it was an up and\nRunning\nAs a [noise]\nI Want\nPeople who are listening in watching to understand right now in ... by the way you're listening on an eye hard the big we don't edited on my heart goes out on the Internet but on television radio we had a dump something really said\nUm\nFranklin just said Kerry make sure that I heard him right\nUh-huh\nI Am a punk\nBecause if I weren't a punk\nI Would go to the convenience store and they have all the guns and I would take the guns away from them and yes they did I hear him correctly you did Paulos is that\nYeah pretty much\nActually so he didn't like my example [laughter] and they're not venture was\nGo in and trying to Rob the store with four people with guns because if you're not a punk like bags you'll just take their guns away grants bitch field when we come back on the Joe ... shows me [noise] you're listening [noise]\nLaws now we need gun legislation now how many people have to die the president in some how did this the n._r._a. some how did this when you see the reaction sadly we're not surprised our way\nNo Joe and you know first off I I Want you know unlike most Americans I was speechless when I heard this again on Saturday I I'm tired of mass shootings I don't want them you know we are committed to trying to find ways and solutions and empower people to come up\nWith solutions for themselves and that includes armed security arming yourselves whatever that may be but I feel for these victims I feel for their families my heart goes out to them and I'm left with no words\nAnd then I'm left with discussed you know so my anger that this happens then turns to discuss when I have to turn on Sunday Morning and watch the mainstream media\nBlame President Trump for this as you said again the colds and the an array of somehow responsible and then of course the calls for gun bans ... you know Joe\nEvil is walk this earth and there are evildoers that had been walking this or they will always walk among us and they have from the beginning of time right so the question becomes what are we prepared to do as a society\nTo protect ourselves from those people I Would love to live and fantasy world where we don't need armed security at every soft target gathering and yes a synagogue and in a church gathering and heck your Boy Scout meeting the soft target\nAll of these things we've got to take precautions we got to do what's right with God on power people because I'm just tired of watching this unfold and no new gun law is going to solve the issue and you're never going to take away all the guns are the people because we have something in this country called the second amendment is absolute and it's not going away whether they like it or not\nIt's ... he was a great host over at a an array TV you know you bring up something interesting ... it is a fantasy\nBut we'd love to have this where we don't have to lock our doors we could leave our cars running in the in the cold the winter so which one we get back in we'd love to to think that we're not to protect ourselves at all because it's all rainbows and butterflies but the fact is grant there are bad people out there doing bad things in every bit of gun legislation I've ever seen\nTries to restrict you and me the good guys and tells the bad guys continue being bad\nLook it's against the law to kill people to synagogue it's against the law to kill people in the school or to church or at a movie theater those laws already exist that it didn't dissuade these people from doing it the last thing we want to do is say well we should norm ourselves either 'cause that's somehow we'll make it easier\nYou know gun laws are the only set of laws that the law abiding has to worry about breaking right I don't worry about burglary laws I'm not burglar rising homes don't worry about murder I'm not murdering anybody I don't worry about robbery laws I don't go around from people\nBut I Do carry my firearm on a daily basis and I worry about different cities what the regulations right they want to have to walk into one restaurant or I Can't walk into a bar or I Can't walk here I Can't go to this state it by accidentally drive across the bridge from\nFrom Virginia in Washington DC then I'm facing a felony in Twenty years in prison right only the law abiding when it comes to gun laws are the ones that have the onus not to somehow break the law\nIt's insane to me you know we have a right to protect ourselves the law abiding it's not the problem that's for sure\nYeah I've often thought to myself if you're going to have a sign up and in Texas it's a thirty six on earth are real one side if you're going to have a sign up some guy can't carry can protect my family my stuff my my person then you should protect the\nIf you're if you're going to have an open a combination please come in here uh don't worry don't bring your gun it'll be better off if you didn't shouldn't ... then that business that outlet that\nWhatever happens to be offered me the safety that I would've offered myself otherwise\nWell you would hope that they would but oftentimes what I see is ignorance from lack of knowledge\nThey're not thinking they're living in the fairy tale world that they put a sign in the window that somehow the criminals going to say oh there's a sign of the window I'm gonna leave my gun in the car you know if it's not happening I find that when I go to a restaurant and I see that side and I ended up leaving my my firearm and the trunk of my vehicle I go in and I talked to I get one chance I talked to him\nHere's why you're safer look we just had a McDonald's in Alabama yesterday I don't know if you saw this", "show_name":
