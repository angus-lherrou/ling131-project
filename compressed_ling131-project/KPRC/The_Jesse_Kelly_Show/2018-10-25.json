wouldn't surprise me I think animals can probably they can certainly tell the difference between day and night they could probably have some sort of a sense about where you are and a twenty four hours cycle when it's going to be about time to be fed\nAnd those types of things but there's a new piece of research that suggests that they have a relatively accurate sense of time scientists measured activity in the bank I get all scientific out here in the medial ends are high HDL cortex of a mouse brain\nWhile while I thought I was hurt myself saying that a wildly wrote and performed attached requiring the measurement of a time interval\nSo they've done some tests with mice on this one is the animals ran along the track to get to the invisible door the cells fired off\nThat part of the brain that animal stopped at the door they see the cells turn off in the new set of cells turn on which they thought was a big surprise so that they saw brain activity change much brain activity is you're going to see them out so I guess\nSo they can tell the the mouse was kind of putting two and two together so the timing sales Raleigh active when the test subjects were waited at the door\nSo they think the findings explained by household pets are often waiting at the food bowl was time for dinner they also think it could help us better understand how things like all Cyprus disease can

from South\nFrom Central America through Mexico who could be in there\nI saw a piece of video yesterday and one of the guys that didn't want to be interviewed who's in the so called caravan\nHad his face almost completely covered and what we could see of his body was completely tattered up top to bottom\nNow I'm not suggesting that if you have tattoos you're in a gang or you're a bad person but you want to be you don't want to be identified you're not some poor person from Honduras looking for a way to feed your kids you know you're all set it up and ready to go and\nWhen you look at people who were from MS Thirteen or coming through our southern border and doing horrible things they tend to be tied it up\nAnd they tend to to not want to be recognized or or or identified\nSo we don't know who's ... what am I was in that or keeping a close eye on that our number three it'll be campus reform because it is Thursday we'll have ah been McDonald on to a tell us some crazy to some nothing is that's happening in college and university campus carry ... which one you wanna start ... what do you think is the is the news that's mostly been covered that I'm guessing that bombing though I'm\nThinking ... packages probably want to start with that yeah\nThe that let's go there okay ah this one as an NBC News too suspicious packages on Thursday addressed a former vice president Joe Biden and in the center Robert De Niro his office in downtown Manhattan are similar to the pipe bomb sent a political and media figures in the past few days according to the FBI\nOn package drafted nine was discovered any postal facility and Newcastle Delaware and other was founded postal facility in Wilmington, Delaware officials that\nAnd I like to the Wednesday that a package of dusted by with somewhere it within the postal system and a pack and sent to deniro what sound at three Seventy five ... street that side of their restaurant try that can grill theatrical owns and the offices of deniro tried that got productions and there's no need to evacuate the building within the police said\nEmployee to narrow it was called authorities around ... am eastern time on Thursday after he realized the package he'd seen earlier in the week uh looked like the other thing the thing officials that\nThe employees are retiring NYPD detective according to John Miller NYPD deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism investigators are looking into whether some of the packages were sent from Florida to senior law enforcement official told NBC News\nThree officials said they believe all the packages were sent through the mail at the CNN package arrived by now to a screening facility in midtown Manhattan before being delivered by courier and the scene in offices and officials that\nPackage with not screened because it was relatively small and the devices are poorly made and some discovered cannot have exploded but it's unclear if that was intentional or if they were just badly constructed official said\nSome the bomb pads substantial flies somehow subtle flies and found have yet to be examined even at seven days explosives were defective and why PT commissioner James O'Neill said they are treating them as alive and devices\nAnd she said they're not aware of any new devices being discovered that are still concerned there couldn't be more cautious when it comes across a potential package of this time to treat it as dangerous\nAll right we appreciate that thank you ... and we'll get into that in our own is certainly will take phone calls on that same if people want to talk about this this suspicious devices I mean we're getting we're getting more and more information in ... and as I take a look at with these devices look like\nIs um I mean it it to me\nThere were a lot of questions there's not enough postage on these packages to be sent there is no post mark on these packages I'm the packages never got to\nThe person that it was either addressed to where the return address was to the media is reporting this is Debbie Wasserman Schultz and and Maxine Waters had these packages in their hands of Bill Clinton did and they had to save them from that it didn't it did not get as far as them many of these were found in the facilities um\nBut there are a lot of questions that we talked to add to cut about that a lot\nAnd I want to know I mean the investigative Lee what are we looking at here I mean what what's the positions can be made and we do that before and move on for those who are in the San Antonio area carry this is a big story yesterday and the day before a Joaquin Castro Who's Afraid to come on the show he's a U.S congressman he is um I think district twenty Democrat\nHis brother is Leon Castro they're twins I think fraternal I can tell them apart so I Would imagine they're fraternal they look very very much alike um holy on was the mayor of San Antonio for a time that he was the housing and urban development director under um than President Obama\nOr he's been mentioned about running for president or whatever Joaquin Castro is his brother who is banned I guess he just assumed that are going to continue as the congressman from district twenty uh he's one of these power players in San Antonio that shouldn't be he has proven through his tweeting but he's not a very smart guy\nAnd recently he was on I think MSNBC and he made a direct delegation that he saw reports that Jared Kushner the son in law the president the United states\nOr had a hit list that he gave to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia took action on it that's like a show that he was killed me that's pretty much what he said even CNN or MSNBC or whatever it was I think we're seeing that actually poppy somebody wears the puppy person which I was younger you know NIH\nHigh or low ... but I don't I don't know\nWhenever he was on he makes that allegation and it's so far left and not so that even the host as us there or not reporting that at all or you got that well suffice it to say there were reports say doesn't back to do with anything that he does like a series of tweets that try to cover his ass because he completely alleged that the son in law the president or somehow complicit in the death of ... showed\nHim and he did that he tweets out of the blue couple of days ago that he was informed\nBy people in San Antonio at the polling places or is it lost palm is is that the area of the city wasn't homeless does that sound familiar does uh-huh how allegedly they contacted him I guess they all have a walking Castro's phone number they contacted him and said that police all essay pd police officers were patrolling\nThe polling places and intimidating them\nNow if you look up this area where the polling places it's clear to me this is very close to a an NSA PT San Antonio police department substation\nThey would have to drive at least we're there to get to the substation or leave us up station\nThere are zero reports that I've seen anywhere even by the most far left wing um outlets in this city or beyond that said police officers are actively telling people who to vote for who not to vote for or to vote or not to vote\nNobody's reporting that oh I see walking Castro tweets that out as if it's happening\nSo I got a hold of bill McManus he used the police chief in San Antonio he and I had been friends for as long as I've been in this job he came shortly after I did I Believe um I I've been here Thirteen Years I think he was right after I got here\nCould be wrong about the about the timing is pretty close though\nAnd he and I have discussed stuff personally we've done it on the air we've debated we disagreed like one one vehement disagree that we had was about about sobriety checkpoints I'm against them because it assumes I'm drunk he's for them for the better good as other people or he agreed with the Supreme Court ruling on it\nBut I'm long or short of it is the guys always been honest with me so I got a hold of them were able to uh connect last night for a few minutes and it said what's going on\nBecause the reports now are that the so called top brass of the police department yesterday P. D. or telling officers not to go to a polling or anywhere near polling places\nWell that she's response was actually a very simple the job of the police department of an a police officers\nIs not to be political at all there is no political role for the SAP he says that SAP\nOfficers were not told to not drive anywhere near where patrol anywhere near\nBut but the long and short of it is they were told you go to a polling place if you're cold there because somebody is a need now I Can't think of any reason why an essay a PD police officer would go to a polling place if not called there\nUnless he or she is going to vote and I don't know what the what the localities are or the rules and regulations are the dress code is for police officer I don't know if you can carry to you know can you go and vote if you're in uniform I don't know\nI I Do not now\nVoted for very long time I've never seen a police officer in uniform voting but nobody\nEighty nine four one Seventy four seven [noise]\nWill certainly take your phone calls and your thoughts on the um on this bomb scare [noise] that among\nOther bottom of the hour so just a couple of minutes we'll have him he a close confidant of vice president Mike Pence uh but I also want to get your phone calls in and here's the operative question I just went through the whole debacle with Joaquin Castro showing an extreme hatred and and a distrust\nOf the police and when he does that it actually shows people in his in his community the his representative district that they should probably follow suit I'm going to always find or the other side I Believe in the men and women and blue eye hash tag back to blue\nWell what are your thoughts about an elected official or us member of Congress a U.S representative somebody who's representing your city whatever city you happen to be in right now usa publicly going on Twitter and attacking the police department\nPublicly good going on Twitter and inferring\nThat the police are somehow intimidating people\n... what does that make you think here's a guy who went in Congress is protected by good guys with guns many times he's protected by law enforcement having no problem whatsoever alleging law enforcement somehow is looking down there and you know ... down there there there's the ruined their nose at people do you better not vote that way\nAre passing through in giving them the look in a police car does he think it's Nineteen fifty three what is wrong with this guy\n\nYou know at some point he's got an answer for his ridiculous comments and statements\nHe has to do with it just hasn't happened yet\nIt's the weirdest thing it eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com your thoughts on that we've got a lot of companies will be a former press secretary for vice president Mike Pence talk about all the issues that you want to know about giving writer\n...\nSet out to this growing him and his family because of their home spring political agenda [noise]\nHere from Nancy Pelosi is going back in charge there threatening to impeach President Trump and Justice Kennedy\nAnd Lizzie Fletcher is on there too [noise]\nStakes couldn't be higher choice couldn't sleep on November ...\nThe liberal ma\nVote against Lizzie Fletcher congressional leadership on a board is responsible for the content of his advertising not authorized by any Canada's Canada's coming up\nThere on on the wall and then jumps on show we mornings by thirty and gave the RCs nice to see\nWhen you get home [noise] Alexa flaky pie or see on my heart radio\n[noise]\n\nAlong the way back when the email always there also Newsmax TV the Joe ... ambulance to the right really glad to have this guy back from\nA GOP the former press secretary for ah for vice president Mike Pence guy who's actually out there on the campaign trail with them right now or it's more of a lot of mark how are ya\nI'm doing great how are you\nBuild your voices open up pretty well you had a busy day yesterday no\n... I was with the vice president we travel had three different stops at two stops in Pennsylvania one in uh Virginia Beach Virginia or outstanding a lot of momentum out there you know every time he we stop\nComing up a you know many hundreds if not thousands folks there just you know ready to go and read it gets thing is they're not ready to just vote themselves they're going to go talk to their friends their family people at church and work and take some voters with them because it will be like to say Republicans don't let Republicans voted low\nBack then run I bet it's pretty good say I had not heard that before\nA by the way go follow them at M. A. R. C. underscore L O T T E R on on Twitter oh he's a great followed post incredible stuff so you're out there in the campaign treasury saw here in Texas down I tuned in Houston or they had about a hundred thousand people sign up for an event that could take Fifteen ... and I mean there is a lot of enthusiasm although\nThe media wants to pretend there's no dues yes I'm On the right how do you fight that\nWe just gotta keep fighting with it by working hard at the same thing that we faced in twenty six paint on the presidential campaign yet knowing that he could win ... when it was overweight\nBut just felt something different when you were on the road and when whether I was traveling with the vice president back then as a candidate or or just yesterday you're feeling the same kind of thing out there\nBut we need people to come out and vote ... that is such that key but these Senate races are are trending in the right direction right now even if you just take the real clear politics average right they've got a they've got us at fifty three seats in the house and there are still three seats out there that are within and maybe a percentage point on the average\nI think there's a very good chance are going to get at least one if not more of those\nSo you're looking at fifty three fifty four seats in in the Senate and the house it's gonna be close there's no doubt about it but\nI think if we can show the energy get people out there tell them how important this is your even\nIf you don't vote you might as well just andme anti polo see the gavel give Maxine Waters a chairmanship and let the subpoenas the investigation start why that's all they're going to do\nIt's a scary thought ... at the same thing to do so it was Robert ... he calls himself ... here in Texas where to get in he's actively\nRunning on be open to the idea of abolishing ice he's running on the idea of impeaching the president of the United states he's running on the idea of Medicare for all which is thirty two trillion dollars and he's running on the idea that we should have open borders and that we recently took half\nOf Mexico from them I mean I don't even know how a guy like that is used anywhere in the same ballpark as Ted Cruz but but you couldn't be more right if people see it on their hands those who are vehemently for a guy like that over blows your waters will go and will miss out we had a lot of energy a few weeks ago\nBecause the Kavanaugh is that where he offered you still there\nNow I think it's still there because what you saw out of Kavanaugh was not just their resistance but what they turn ... was the angry mob and the president says so well it it's it's jobs versus mom yeah\nAnd we see it whether it's what they're doing their march to the socialist left or even as they are just welcoming they're armed and wanting to throw it out the fences and let everyone in from anywhere in the world as you've got a caravan of a thousand ten thousand people coming up from Central America and we know for a fact\nThat there are criminal elements in that group it's not just women and children it's people\nWho have got a history with gang violence and they're going to be supported by the drug cartel\nWe've got to make sure that we support our borders president's been very clear we want to be a country of immigrants and we will take refugees but we've got to do it legally and we got to know who's coming into our country and those who just want to have and\nAnd the Democrats are running on abolish I throw open the borders raise the taxes we can give everything to everybody for free\nAddict the American people are just seeing right through it\nWhat what what Margaret would stop our country from becoming Guatemala or Honduras nothing I mean you you there's a reason why we're so great why you have to work hard to get here you know the wrong way bad work hard come through a ... do it the legal way we love you\nYou can't just break through but you're going to make our country where you came from what you're trying to leave behind ... he's the former um press secretary for vice president Mike Pence all still a good friend you're on the campaign trail with him yesterday\nWhat is the the vice president say when when you take a look at what could potentially be fourteen thousand people looking to invade our border ... we're we're his mindset on those\nEight absolutely in lockstep with the president that we need to a secure our borders not only in the short term because of the because of this oncoming ... but long term through building a wall\nThat it doesn't even a warrant in a you know an academic discussion 'cause there's nothing behind those thoughts but\nAgain as I look out there I saw yesterday I've seen it on the campaign trail so many times there's a lot of energy out there I think it's translating into the polls is going to translate into the into the election results on Tuesday\nEverybody who's lifting from Michigan to Texas Indiana and beyond your vote is going to count don't vote alone bring a friend and do whatever you can get to the bowl\nThat last quick question quick answer if you don't mind it might over exaggerating when I say if the left or to get the house and or the Senate the economic boom we're seeing right now would stop\n[noise] uh I wouldn't I Would definitely put a dent into that I'm not going to say it's going to stop because remember I I don't think they're going to win the Senate or only be able to get the house yeah but they could they could let taxes expire or they could try to hold the government hostage for some other crazy ideas\nIn budget bills and things were going to have to get everybody to agree so let's not take the chance let's not even\nEntertain that thought okay I Do not give Speaker Pelosi the gavel back\nOh that just hurts me to hear you say Speaker Pelosi it is a at M. A. R. C. underscore L O T T E R ... from a GOP also former press secretary was vice president Mike Pence mark makes a million ...\nThings up back after this new Joe ... writer\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAre you

I was sent there to make sure that people get intimidated I don't know what's the one\nIn fact when we saw in Philadelphia two thousand eight that there actually were Black Panther party members intimidating voters telling them to vote for Obama it was the police that had to come in to remove them\nSo the police in my opinion or a positive presidents but the allegation that they were patrolling the parking lot and giving people dirty looks in an antibody hitting them somehow is an allegation even this guy who so far left wing that he doesn't even know it even he should be embarrassed by it but he's not because he just that guy\nWell I don't know what to tell you a job but I'm telling you I Know a lot of hard working cops and why would we intimidated everybody into voting or not voting I mean\nWhy there's no reason to what will the allegation is that so I ... Murphy I appreciate you and thank you for your years of service to the community um the reason that a guy like walking Castro sent something out like that whether he got a call or not I have no proof that he was contacted but he says he was\nUm the reason why he says that I was because he wants to allege that the police\nAre somehow evil and the Republicans and she is a strong fervent supporter of of of democracy and the Democrats in your right to vote it it's just the guy's a sham ... every every ... he puts out a puts his intelligence and question even more from me\nLet me go back out at Vic allegedly knows Joaquin Castro used to work with them or something that I cannot prove that and I told my daughter basically I wasn't gonna take you on the air and we're we're really where we're skating on very thin ice when it when it comes to somebody alleging that they know somebody or what is that you worked with them in the campaign I don't know that to be a fact\nTo know that right up front what's on your mind however\nNo nope wrong you go oh yeah I actually was part of walking gastro staff when he was a state representative in taxes\nUm I've known walking for a long time uh I don't think either do fish uh I Do obviously like you said he's a very well educated guy went to Stanford and Harvard I think you do in this climate that we have the um where right now we're in the middle of this hot\nHot time in America it's so easy for us to appeal to both basis either one left or right and well I certainly\nWould hope that if I was a member of walking that right now to advise them not to be putting such language out against the the cops I can assure you that walking is a very very\nEven articulate man he cares a lot about it at you and I know for certain that he cares a lot about cops and the members of the San Antonio police\nDepartment I Want to stop you in other ways that are just defend the guy with the guys afraid to come on the show and defend themselves but let me ask you very directly when he was on CNN the other day and he made that disgusting allegation about Jared Kushner did that make him look intelligent to you\nI\nI I did not see the common\n... well what about you you're listening to my show and you know that I met a liar so I'm going to tell you in context what he said he said the Jerry ... there were reports out there that I've seen this is what he said\nThat we're Jared Kushner gave apolitical hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who obviously acted on it was ... that took this guy said even poppy what's her face over on CNN had to say we're not reporting that what reports are you talking about I thought\nOkay there you go oh she's she says we're not reporting that we certainly haven't reported that he said well I've seen reports just just suffice it to say I've seen reports and then later he had to take to Twitter and tried to explain his way out of it he actually alleged that the son in law the president the United states\nGave the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Hitler's on which showed ... name was and clearly the crown prince acted\nOn it that's what a walking Castro said on live television Vic\nSo as much as you and I I look I admit I have a personal conversations with little young holy and and I don't agree on much but at least the guy had a set big enough to come on my show and break it down and get it done and we're always very nice to each other when we saw each other Joaquin seems to be a little bit out of his mind\nWhen you go on live television allege something like that if you don't have concrete proof that that happened\nI think that you're a dumb guy I mean that would that would lead somebody to believe he's not very smart right\nCertainly\nGo and you know what after I get off the phone with you right now\nI'm personally going to call walking in and tell him that I was defending him on the joke pack Joe and encourage him to come on your show\nWhile I Would appreciate that but I Would do it but to me that we do yourself a favor also before you make that phone call\nGo and look on the Internet and find that piece of information that clip with with poppy Harlow and go watch what he says and then see how he had to try to backtrack and then it takes to Twitter as you I'm sure you've seen\nAnd he does allege that there's something inherently wrong with a police officer\nPatrolling narrow polling place and many signs that Joaquin is if you've got a call him if you see this kind of information now I don't think that you're a liar Vic I think that you're telling the truth that he's a nice guy he's smart he likes beliefs but when you put something out there that says the exact opposite about police\nWhy shouldn't I Believe his tweet his tweet is alleging the police are intimidating people at polls you'd agree with that right\nYes so I mean what are you all about that\n\nI think what what what it\nIs happening right now Joe is I I heard your interview the other day I was explaining that your daughter she is the one\nThat is my daughter is on the phone that\nI appreciate it I Know ... I'm a good friend and Nicola ... good guy was a freshman at Central Catholic you\nKnow when he was that when he was a senior coke and I think what what what is interesting Joe is Nico touched upon something because guys like me and Nico there is no longer a part of\nThe blue dog Democrat within our party\nThere is no place for you at all there is no place for you whatsoever on the left any more there just isn't\nAnd and Joe I think what ended up happening is that guy like Joaquin who I work for who I Believe is actually more centrist then he left on\nThink a guy like walking has to push so far to the left in order to appease the bay by throwing out innuendos and things that seemed completely out of left field\nWell I've got to tell you that I I got to tell you I don't know what team because he's afraid to talk to me I've never met the guy I met his brother and I know his brother but if I only know him from his Twitter feed\nOr from where he shows up on local television only supporting illegal aliens and so on\nI have to make a decision about who the guy is so if I invite you to come on and you show me the somebody different I'm done with that and and it's not about me it's about the reach I have\nBut he doesn't want to do that 'cause I think you're right I think that he will you'll make the overlords on the far left mad\nAt him so he's got to keep on being this guy who keeps on going as hard left lied and he's gonna find themselves out of a job is going to find themselves on trustworthy and he's gonna find themselves in a real pickle if he needs to rely on police after\n\nLet me ask you a personal question of financial question what is the balance from your credit card\nAnd what is the interest rate on their credit card why not turn those balances into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate and start saving money\nLight stream offers credit card consolidation loan from six point one four percent NPR with auto pay good alone from five thousand to a hundred thousand dollars and you could even get your phones\nAs soon as the day you apply light streamed believes that people have good credit deserve a great interest rate and no fees plus there were a division of sun trust bank one of the nation's largest financial institutions that you can have complete\nPeace of mind my listeners can save even more right now that additional interest reduce count on top of white streams already low rates the only way to get the discount as good a light streamed dot com slash bags\n...

say most drawn during will know that we don't know who these people are we we don't know how many people have been injected from the middle eastern from elsewhere we know that there are factions in there from other than Central America and North America\nWe come back we're going to break it down with lieutenant colonel ... encourages sending more what do we know about the caravan and what is an investigation into\nA boost these bombs these alleged bombs\nWhat does that investigation looked like where are they in right now what can they find out Joe ... she'll come back you know past [noise]\nVideo the good news is no God oh yeah and I'm telling you something the person doesn't want them to go off there in art or they're put together in a way it is designed only to instill fear and not actually to kill our main evil yeah\nThat was that those devices again this person has to either get it done this individual the world\nOr they don't want them to go up because they've got to know if you're going to address a package to the high level people\nThat they're all boxes are going to be All right well and that they're going to be hard so a lot of commonalities have read it together and that's what a lot of course the book store right now so there are that do that they left a lot of DNA and forensic evidence windows I just\nAnd I'm sure they're pursuing that we got cameras courses is about same day or error with Ted Kaczynski there was no leveling history it was it was killing people with a positive male was around\nAnd of course you know if you didn't make a bomb you practice and you know you said these things off somewhere somebody does this guy or girl\nUm but this person is watching the news as well\nAnd so we'll see what happens I caught it though that uh or the ... the next day sooner about who this really is\nIt's a ... for the summer tourism wants the marriage university ... we get DNA and we get evidence we gets bigger principle of exploded bombs these haven't exploded so you've got to be just an absolute pleasure of information available on there I mean you can't be so careful that there's nothing left when you make a bomb right\nYeah it's not just that but also you got the there's cameras there's cameras everywhere in New York so someone as a career you know something can be traced back\nAnd that's why I think we have a very good chance of finding out who this but I Would also you know make an appeal to the public it you know what do you think about some of the gate and this type of behavior has yeah shrimp somebody knows who this fellow is so often they had a real bad you know somebody does something\nAnd a sugar per se pursuing those lanes and as you mentioned this is you know turn into a political ... of course as we

know their bomb youngest her boss but maybe they were made to look like a bomb you know\nMaybe there are there but I think the main goal this person is to get media attention you know that's what they're doing so we haven't you know we've seen pictures of ice expert\nUm but I heard people say they're bomb like oh and so we don't really know what they are detonated right\nEven if they would say so uh adding all those things together and here's this person or or ... it was to get attention whether the rather than it was actually kill\nIs this by definition terrorism\nIt is terrorism because
