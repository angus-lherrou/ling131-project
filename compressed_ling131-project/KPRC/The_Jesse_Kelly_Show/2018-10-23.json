tiki which is a social travel company\nFor those in the eighties the thirty five demo according to them a majority of millennials would give up sex for travel they say they surveyed more than Fifteen hundred millennials across the U.S and found that fifty seven percent of people in that generation would rather hop on a plane than hop into bad\nIt's interesting\nNow the only reason why they might make some sort of sense is that something that seems to motivate millennials are experiences\nThey'd rather have experiences than almost anything else see different parts of the world do things they've never done before meet people they've never met before experiences so I guess travel goes along with that so maybe it does make a little bit of sense\nBut sex is a lot cheaper almost everybody can afford to have sex\nTravels a different story that could be you know that can be expensive very expensive for some maybe you're part of the reason why they like travel so much to lose it means taking time off from work and I don't think millennials are afraid to take vacations so what other things would millennials according to gun tiki would they give up in order to travel\nUm\nFor sixty percent of them sex that was number one I'm another sixty percent said that they would give up carbs Seventy seven ... know where'd you go walk\nInto a gas or I'll eat protein but I'd give up carbs no ice cream do potato chips no pizza to travel ha Seventy three percent\nSaid they'd give up alcohol for travel now hang on do you believe that you'd give up all alcohol for travel Seventy percent of them said that\nI'm\nTrying to get a free ten day trip I guess it's okay if I'm just doing it for ten days but I assume they were talking about giving up in its entirety right or they just thought about giving it up for the trip\nMillennials also said now here this has got to be alive millennials also said that they would gladly give up their cell phones in order to travel although only about forty one percent reported they would give up their screen for something so sweet in reality it's much easier to understand the trade\nOff in traveling gives you a chance to disconnect from social media so I see whatever you're giving up I guess you're just giving up for the trip\nSo if you're giving up section of giving it up for the trip well that's different then that would make sense but that's interesting the travel is that important\nAlthough one of the places evidently not attempting to reach millennials or to appeal to them is the state of Nebraska did you hear about the new tourism pitch and some people in Nebraska or going really this is your idea their tourism pitches honestly it's not for everyone\n\nWho's it for her if it's not for everyone who's it for is that single out the brass 'cause being special or is that you're saying well you know\nA lot of people are going to you're not like it or maybe not for everybody [noise] I'm a\nWell here's an interesting pitch a focus group in Minneapolis, Kansas city in Denver came up with another ad that said festivals for everyone from ... testicles huh the letter evidently referring to a Father's Day weekend\nTesticle festival would would you go to a testicle festival festival getting say it um I immediately it happens at a steakhouse there the features deep fried sheep and beef testicles\nThose referred to as like Rocky Mountain oysters yeah the only way I mean not as if I don't know what it is\nIt's like blood putting their had blood putting weight to England once that was the most disgusting thing I ever ate blow OU onto a blood putting is okay I guess I should explain see a\nLittle bit that I went to went to London my sister and her family were living in England just north of leads at the time so we went over and we thought that's a great excuse to do go to England so to go visit so we went there were staying at a B. and B. and we get the next morning and uh they've got something on the menu traditional\nBritish breakfast that that was great\nLead like the Brits so it came with the eggs and the game was sausage usual stuff\nBut there was this one thing it was is round\nAnd uh it ... it almost looked like a little cake of some sort and I really couldn't tell what it was\nAnd um you know I'm\nI don't need to have an explanation of everything I put in my mouth so I thought you know if it's traditional British breakfast\nI should try it right I'll Try it so I took a bite on what hey this this is not bad it's actually pretty good actor delicious and I said I don't know what this this but this is pretty good\n... and she looked at me and he had this look on her face and she said\nYou don't want to do with that as\nI said what do you mean I don't want to know what that is so so I called the waiter over and I said what is this and he said it's blood putting\nI said well what's blood pointing is cheaper cow's blood that they that they cook ... and they cook it on a on a on the grill it's called blood it's cooked animal blood\nThat's all it is is cooked gamble blood it's kind of disgusting\n\nBut strangely delicious you know some things I guess you're better off just you know try and not asking any questions\nI Would have been a lot happier pattern not knowing what that was if I just went ahead and an eight it enjoyed it and forgot about it um [laughter] damages their story some people I mentioned the story\nBecause I'm I'm a well known hater of a a pumpkin spice this time of the year you know you go into the store you go into the grocery store and and they've got little Debbie cakes\nPumpkin spice they've got Oreo cookies pumpkin spice everything in the world they've got a pumpkin spice version yeah I thought there's some things that\nReally seriously do we have to pumpkin spice the entire world is because his pre Halloween just because it's October November and evidently the answer's yes buffalo wild wings is added pumpkin spice to their wing menu\nYep even they'd gone pumpkin spice evidently it is a combination of ales some sort of a a a a real mixed with barbecue flavors and pumpkin\nSpice and it's disgusting is to discuss it as I generally am about public and slice I actually looked\nAt them thought [noise] maybe I should try that maybe they'd actually would be good [noise] ale\nBarbecue sauce and pumpkin spice it might be on the stuff they have used to have a great evening or a\nCeasefire five Eva surefire on K. C. R. H. Houston's morning news and back here tomorrow afternoon and the three on K theocracy [noise]\n\nThey are seen from the gallery furniture made in America studios this is Katie our sci fi if they [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] something has to be dying nine ... cancer President Trump is saying that the kind of an of migrants from Central America continues to make it to the U.S southern border I mean ... theory about who is funding it noxious gas relative doll has more live\nAnd do what he's doing 'em in what many other law enforcement agencies are doing across the border as we're wondering if there's two to five thousand member caravan it's is going to be coming here so we'll get into that certainly\nBut I Want to start out with something that's been trending\nOn Twitter and it's just this is the question that I've often wanted to\nAsk why is it such a problem that you guys\nKnow that I Am somebody who is completely absolutely ... hundred percent non racist non ethnocentric I don't care what your background is I don't care what your gender is and I frankly don't carry you want to sleep with\nI Am somebody who just doesn't care enough to be cleared by those things and but by the way your your heritage is subject to be celebrated is not something that should be a negative in my opinion\nSo\nYou're still am I taking care of and comments and if they want to deal with a play the parity the Caribbean parity I'll play it I'm not doing Caribbean off the top you're the one I got to do a bunch of talk about the turtle do it later on to start with southern Megan Kelly said well you see this where Megan Kelly I guess we're talking about black face\nNow into that\n... so she's on her show today what's it called ... it looked at me and Megan Kelly in the morning on today or something something like that out of them um and they're talking about Halloween costumes and they're talking about whether you can be in blackface white\nSo whatever she actually makes the statement that I Know that it's somehow you know if you're white you can't wear black face it if you're black um then you can't wear white face that actually is not true or they didn't do wanes brothers or somebody do a a a movie called white girls and they dressed up like work white girls the whole but I don't remember anybody saying it was racist\nWas it the way his brother's yes okay\nWhy don't you get to a movie called white girls and actually dress up and pretend you're a white girl the entire movie there's nothing racist about that at all but if you were black face that is racist now let's talk about the background the black face the most famous black face artist\nFrom the Nineteen twenties I Believe was al ... al ... was a singer and in these minstrel shows he would he would put on black face pretend he was a black person and to entertain Audi ensues by pretending to be a race that he wasn't\nHe was doing it um in in stark disrespect\nFor black people because it would've been fun to have a black person up there say why you have to pretend you're black to saying they didn't make any sense to me but um that's what he did and many other people did that\nIn the day it was certainly disrespectful to the black race and it was also a a byproduct of of a mechanism of racism that was ingrained in our country back then in other words the black person wasn't allowed to go and sing in front of his white audiences so a white guy would dress up like a black person\nThat's how ridiculous it was it was ridiculous I rejected a rebuke it\nHaving said that\nIf you're dressing up for Halloween and you happen to be a white or Hispanic person and you want to dress up as a black person you can't you can't make your skin tone a few shades darker\nTo look more appropriate in costume really and if you can't why can't you because you know my favorite athletes my entire life have been black most of my favorite musicians had been black if I wanted to depict or impersonate\nA black person Halloween why couldn't I\nMean 'cause that's not racist racism is is the ideology that you believe your race is better than another and because of that you treat the other race in a lower fashion the lesser fashion or even beyond that in a violent way whatever\nIt's horrible I reject racism always have\nHow it's not racist to dress up like a black person or a black person to dress up like a white person it's not I think impersonation is a great form of flattery\nIf one person a black person means that I'm I'm somebody who wants to\nBe seen as doing something cool or something right just as something awesome that I wanted to dress up like this specific person I mentioned it before I was a big fan of Mohammed Ali and the ring is politics out of the ring not so much but in the ring big fan of his and certainly a fan of his military is a humanitarian ism throughout his life\nBig fan of Charlie Parker the saxophone player back in the day although he died at a young age I'm for ridiculous cause he lived horribly\nIt was a great saxophone player a big fan of filling the blank you know athletes are just a huge fan of many athletes who happened to be black I'm also a fan of some some white athletes of Hispanic athletes but generally speaking a lot of my idols in my mentor is growing up I happen to be black\nIf I Would have to dress up like one of them for Halloween how racist\nMegan Kelly ask that question how is it racist\nToo if you want to I think she used the example of Diana Ross if you want to dress up as Diana Ross and dark and your skin to make you look a little bit of a winter is like\nIt is racism through and through now\nYou know that I get a good amount of black folks to call my show and I have for ever and I appreciate that plenty of white people to plenty of Asians I Would imagine that but anybody calls desire in Asian\nUm but plenty of of Latinos or I've got plenty of everybody who listens and calls in and take part in the show\nI Am so unbelievably willing to hear your argument\nAs to why somebody can't properly the picked a black person during Halloween and they happen to not be black or white person if they happen to not be white why can't pay why is that racist\nOr or a [noise]\nBut it's not if I decide that I Want to dress up like prints for example a prince was not much darker than I Am so might\nNot have to change my skin tone but if I'm comparing myself to a picture of prints and I got it down except for the skin tone why can't I dark and it a little bit what's wrong with that or on the go as Michael Jackson why couldn't I liked it a little bit he was way way than I Am\nSo how is this in our day and age somehow offensive\n\nI don't think it is now what bothers me about the whole thing Megan Kelly first and I don't watch that show I've never watched from that morning show I used to watch your night show when she was on Fox you know here and they're not in the yard or anything but she's no apologized for what she said is that something for what you need to apologize\nYeah and again may maybe I'm missing it but if I Want to go as fill in the blank famous person and that person's skin tone is different than mine wouldn't it make sense for me to change my skin tone to look more like the person and how exactly does that offensive or a cut down are critical or insulted\nI'm open to hear your reasoning and I'm also open to hearing what you want to hear the stupid Caribbean party I don't know if I'm going to play it I actually asked I beg poll to shut it off in his studio but he did he listened in like the sneaky guy he is listened in\n\nLike I knew you would open trying to you know one of the way I was walking out of the stadium most of the time by the way the first take I had to get rid of because you've talked over it [laughter] thank you [laughter] it's a eight eight nine for one pack said it eight nine four one Seventy four seven Joe packs dot com your thoughts when

liked it I'm I'm Glad\nI think a great great whatever sure appreciate it I I had a point\nOf a you know is left that's out there you know say all this crap about uh you know um uh what's\nYour name Megan Kelly I live in LA do you uh well ... ...\nOr ... or ...\nThe leftist and I'm a gun it only junior Robert Downey junior who did a movie Tropic Thunder if you remember that movie\nWhy do I I remember that it's probably ...\nYes probably ten or twelve years ago remember polo telling me about it when it came out and blow you actually went and saw it right\nYes it'd be entire time he's pretending to be a black guy\nA good part of it yes\nAnd I think they also said the word retard throughout the movie too that got him in trouble there were all of a movie for a few different reasons but have you been on the right he never would have got to work again of course after they became Iron Man\n... yeah so I wasn't punished at all that right\nNow and it's it's ridiculous watching what she was a ... like it just totally crazy\nBut it's just really confusing to see a liberal left and yell at me or doing something that a projection I'm just it is the first episode that just\nGot it but it happens every single day and they're falling all over them so I appreciate the phone all of them are all over themselves to to find something more to complain about\nIt's not the same thing but at the same ridiculous dumb this about race did you see the tweet that Peter put out today Paul oh no I did not than white milk is a representation of white supremacy or something\nAnd that you're going to be actual three right here this is this is how stupid is\nCow's milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists one more reason to ditch dairy that's from Pete is a fictional account the verified\nPita account um I don't understand do they think that if they say it will just believe it\nHonestly you can't drink cow's milk 'cause if you do your white supremacist and it's just an organization that millions of people belong to and they support what they say is it ... not just ridiculous as dumb as it is\nAnd maybe you believe that by the way this country because of our constitution you're allowed to believe that\nYou're wrong and it's a dumb way to think what you're allowed to think that way\nIf you're somebody like me who believes that we do have borders we do have a defined nation we have to find the laws on how to come here legally or whether permanently or temporarily and if you're likely you believe that we should be following those laws\nI Believe and I believe is firmly no I Do not have proof so this is certainly my opinion but it's pretty educated opinion after Kavanaugh and after the balance Republicans in conservative saw because of how ridiculous\nThe idiots on the on the left on the Judiciary Committee acted I Believe they devised a plan we have to somehow get the momentum back on our side\nWhat works for us what is the issue that works for us and they throw in a couple of trial balloons out there the first one was\nThere were lobbying saying that conservatives and Republicans want to get rid of preexisting conditions coverage in in health insurance that's not true we had Ron Johnson on this program Republican from Wisconsin who said their ... joker lying\nWe're not trying to get rid of coverage for preexisting conditions that is not part of what we're doing it's a bold faced lie he said and I believe him and he's got proof that its ally\nThe left however whether it's a pundit on television or is somebody who is running for governor like Andrew Gillum who by the way is up six points on dissent is a guy who allegedly received two thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for free\nAnd never reported it that's why he wouldn't answer the question the other day with the same as saying that I'm In that debate he somehow up by six and he's lying about Republicans want to get rid of pre existing conditions same thing Robert Frances B. Irishman Beto O'Rourke says here in uh in Texas\nThere just lying about it but they they think that might work well look the Republicans don't want you to have Medicare don't you'd have Medicaid and don't want to existing conditions covered in fact the Republicans for some reason and they've never give it a good reason I Love to see the reason why\nThe Republicans for some reason if you believe them just don't want people to have health insurance\nAnd they don't want people have medical care\nAnd then when people have a doctor\nRepublicans or conservatives if you believe the left would like to only have a doctor for themselves or something and nobody else could have a doctor that's a stupid his but for some reason it's permeating or else they wouldn't keep on doing it so they floated that one\nAnd now they're floating this one or Republicans hate the children what about the children [noise] they hate the children\nRemember the the picture of the separation of children and parents was a picture of a three year old girl who hadn't been separated from her mother her mother actually separated her from her father who had a good job in Honduras and her mother had been deported several times before\nThat was the picture used by the left in time magazine went cold out on that person not having been separated from her mother in fact your mother's legs are on the same picture time magazine says yeah but she but she does represent the story even though specifically that wasn't as she does represent the story\nReally\nHere's the latest on this so called caravan you know and and you ask yourself\nWhat is it that we're doing to stop this this is from a a F P news in a poll H E y ... LA ... Mexico I have no idea how to pronounce that\nWould you do ... smell when with him a July acts tea away\nWe slow know are the ages always silent right some of the ... yeah maybe\nOr we used to love I Love 'cause you don't pronounce exes either I I think they made the name up with the last movie I think we just put a bunch of letters don't say it again we ... we ... okay you say so [noise] um here's the story thousands of mainly Honduran migrants heading to the United states a caravan president Donald Trump is called but it's salt in our country\nStop to rest the Tuesday after walking for two days in the Mexican territory sleeping on cardboard boxes or plastic bags of migrants set up a massive impromptu camp on the southern town of weeks ... something like that whatever\nSeventy

totally be the Caribbean has become a politically loaded issue with only two weeks ago before the United states votes a key mid term elections in which Trump is seeking to protect a Republican majority on Capitol Hill Trump\nHas taken they're not coming and President Trump for some reason has taken to attack in the Caribbean regularly both on Twitter and on the campaign trail firing up as conservative base of the anti immigration rhetoric that help to get him elected into the sixties 'cause it's right or is an ass wagon Jennifer Gonzales is their national egging general ... has cut ruby us\nA couple of ... yeah she she's a liar and she's misrepresenting exactly what it says he's never had anti immigrant rhetoric she's alive is this a an opinion piece notes supposed to be news

just that's horrible it's just really bad reporting\nUm yeah man\nSo I don't have an actual number year there were a thousand here there are two thousand therefore hundred over there so they they sort of have a broken up\nBut manage just written these you feel sorry for their feet feel sorry for the sleeping and boxers nobody told them to leave on Doris except for whoever was that was paying the bill somebody was putting the bill somebody gave them cash there were there were videos of people being handed cash as they wait in line\nNobody ... there was some big you know swelling on on Instagram or Twitter that said All right anybody who wants to go get a better life for their families are in the head north to the United states just come with us now this this is coordinated this is classic um\nCommunity organizing this is what community organizer it looks like you gather a big enough to Lenski formed crowd and it makes those watching go wow there really is a problem there or wow maybe we really are wrong about this or why oh really have to help the children\nWhat would you have the president do if you were in his ear what would you have him do\nIs we were hearing about National Guard at the border but the vast majority of an armed what are we going to do what's the plan to stop a group that doesn't believe in boarders that's about to crash our border\nAnd why exactly didn't Mexico doing even if these people only forty five miles inside the border there was about a mile and why don't you stop them are you feeding them are you offering them refuge are you offering them asylum if not why not why does it Mexico cared about the people\nThat's it man I gave it to give give you the best I had those who haven't heard the parity yet I might play now are thrown into playing the second hour I'm going to give people a break for an hour but there were people who called and said that they were all singing like stuck in traffic so you never know you never know let me go back at it and say hello to Jeff in Kansas City Geoff what's going on high\nAge oh good job I liked the parity thank you yeah it was good at least you know the other guy hated it yeah well that's his problem [laughter]\nI it's not as good as a one I had stuck in my head all day and what's that one I think\nThe Kavanaugh parity so what I Want to go to sleep I couldn't because that thing was stuck in my head\nWas it Brett Kavanaugh or was it cabin on to the tune of Panama which one Brett Kavanaugh yeah I did\nTwo of them for you know I like that one to one worked out pretty well\nYeah it really stuck or ...\nI broke appreciate your general Jeff just like the ... the Salem keeping people up at the ... to get him to take a nap\nSo what we do pull it that\nThat's got to be hard for the listeners can go to see because I'm thinking about my ... yeah I mean how ...\nHow that happened and I'm assuming they were listening to the pond caster ...\nMost of them over the Web site now I mean one website you can go and listen to the ... now or in the interviews were there and so on so you could have been going there or maybe I should without a warning on top of the website ... weren't before sleep yeah yeah\nMaybe it'd be nice let me go back at it and say hello to a line three is going to be Joel and Alaska Joel what's going on\nHey Joe hey getting called her up here starting to rain a lot of big time Republican since that President Trump came up to bat cool a high school I said we've got to have a businessman running their country and that's it yeah\nSo he's the first person that voted for my whole life and the president while oven it's awesome it's doing everything great but the care of it now that we can't refuse to accept the fact that we've got to have a crisis down there but people get hurt or something we need to go to the city for a ... page at a jar pilots but\nFor the city it was something that is that's the labor force maybe they could build the wall for us\nYeah in Maricopa County when Jordan was the sheriff there he would arrest them make them wear pink outfits and put them up in a tent city in the in the desert um I I don't see why we have to cuddle him\nWhen somebody is Lee illegally coming here they're breaking the law and they're trying to basically steal from the American people why would you welcome them with open arms and give them all the benefits of of wrongdoing it doesn't make sense\nI Would say we got close that border for sure\nNo right or not you know you and I are agreeing yeah we we agree that I think that that would ... solution wasn't Maricopa County was the right one I appreciate you Joel open light now a lie no at eight eight eight nine for one pack Joe ... dot com will continue to go back to Kansas City and Dan Hi Dan\n[noise] hey how you doing a\nLimited dream and what's happening and come to come to America\nYeah yes yeah I I probably should have been the ... ...\nS C I loved it um to point out they've got a twenty dollars a day I got a ... approximately\nHow they got to take up for God's sakes and when they when they can you imagine a driving cross country with your kids and how they come on I was like\nOh that is how are we there yet or are we there yet I have to go to the bad about where we there no listen and I ... I Lived through that it is it's no fun well if it is if they do have a thousand miles to go\nAnd they're going twenty miles a day it's simple math I mean if you had a hundred miles to go take five days so it's a thousand miles going to take fifty days five zero\nSo how old are you supposed to get here by the election which the plan there that's kind of weird isn't it\n... but again those who are financing this and those who gathered it and those who a community organizer this they don't care what we would just lose again they don't care about the people that are coming here they care about the optics of exhibit can learn from\nThat's it [noise] it eight nine for one pack Joe packs dot com but al ... when we come back to the writer [noise] has had\nPick the job on a lot of people\nI've seen police officers you know guys like this to who walk around like like you know their stuff doesn't think I've seen some who I think are sometimes too lenient you seem to really have it down to who I'm going to interact with my neighbor here maybe somebody who goes to church with me or my my kids go to school together\nBut at the same time I can't let them go too far because then that would make it bad for the community is that kind of how you approach it\nYou know that is these are my neighbors these are people that I'm gonna see at the store and these are people that I'm going to deal with in the future and uh I don't know what his what ... is gone on in their life to put him to this point yeah so I tried to treat everybody with dignity and respect and we tried to go there now they escalate it\nI don't have a problem escalated as well but I find that even if you can attract more flies and then you can't\nSay it and in watching you interact with a good share of more land from ... county I've seen that I mean you walk up generally speaking no my ... unless they like get a shot somebody you walk up generally speaking very respectful and and you seem to be giving them the benefit of the doubt now\nHow often do you think is there a percentage you can put on this where somebody will not get with the program not understand that you might actually be willing to cut them a break and they just don't shut up and they just give you a hard time and it's this whole community versus the police but is there a percentage of people that you think talk their way into jail or into a ticket or something\nOh yeah I don't know what it is for most police officers I mean for me it's probably about ten percent of those ...\nOr ... difficult to deal yeah ... that you know I'm I'm a believer in calmness and power if you walk out your calm and they can steal that they don't feel you're amped up it it really helps that situation go a lot smoother even if you have to rest\nAnd ended up going to last but there's some people that just like you said from the word do they're not with the program and uh you can tell that immediately\nWhat I've learned from watching you would share of mark lampooned al ... Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like like pd and others um ... is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's gonna get with the program you'd probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on them\nAnd but they're also minor enough to where you could still get them home tonight that's really yeah it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue that you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm was work through it um\nIt does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get back on it on a charge has to do it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nWhen I get pulled over and and you don't know what kind of cars I have but when I get pulled over and it's often a I may have my hands are tending to I've got the inside light on a bit the window rolled down and I'm thinking whoever it is the man or woman just walking up you know for the for the survey that community sometimes that helps me sometimes it doesn't I have\nHad a ticket or two in my life but it also helps having the radio and TV show because I get to say hello to the officer on the air and that seems to get me somewhere too I'm sure mark lamb sure we talked about this in Washington how close to the border is ... county are you on the border\nNow we're not on the border we're about Seventy miles off the border and\nWe have an Indian reservation that Donald I'm Indian nation that's on the south into our county a very big Indian reservation that actually ... runs all the way to the border and across the board awhile part reservation in Mexico\nAnd so it's a very unique situation that's one of the or their community is is a ... been opposed to a wall across their reservation\nWhich split the slick them apart yeah\nYeah and so and that's one of the big reasons it would split their reservation apart and\nWhat happens is is that there is only a three strand barbed wire fence across that area and that's one of the sauce spots where it's easy for these people to come across it's about a six day hike through the desert or unless somebody out there is a coyote that transports him in a vehicle upright who\nSort of about five miles south of the I ... interstate is whether the reservation ends", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jesse Kelly Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "23"}
