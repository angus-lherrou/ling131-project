near Mexico southern border are working their way\nTo the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Mexico city demanding officials in the country turn that caravan around\nMexico has announced it will when appropriate return migrants coming through Mexico to their home countries secretary Pompeo says the U.S and Mexico are working to address the issue\nWe're quickly reaching a point which appears to be a moment of crisis a record numbers of migrants\nIs is truly startling because I guess it's okay if you're a black woman to be racist\nI guess if you're a black woman you can actually be racist against everybody other than black woman and you can for some reason get away with it I'm going to actually show this going to show this to um to those who are watching them feed\nNow I've always known that she's a racist she's made it clear that she's a racist just how she treats people just how she acts in her role ah on on these committees as a senator it is and it's been\nPretty clear that she is a racist along the same lines as Brock Obama where she's always going to side with somebody who she feels she could identify with before she identified before she sides with somebody other like a with Obama you can go down a list of Michael Brown was a criminal was on drugs Obama took his side\nAnd of course round was wrong and the police officer was right again the Trayvon Martin Obama because George Zimmerman was seen as a white Hispanic Obama took Trayvon Martin side even though a jury said yeah you probably shouldn't circle back and start to beat was not a guy\nWith a Eric Garner Obama side with Eric Garner although in that case I actually believe that police could've handled differently and our governor might still be alive today with Skip Gates in Cambridge Obama took his buddy Skip Gates side over the police who he said actors I get up extra but so\nKamala Harris is very much racist along the same lines as Brock Obama if there's an opportunity to take the side of somebody who she feels as a similar racer closely identified with her she will take that side that's not something normal people generally do unless you're a racist\nOr [noise]\nBut today she tweeted this out I'm gonna show the people who are watching on the on the feed right now\nShe sends out this tweet\nAnd there there's the video\nAnd it says elect black women and what she writes the tweet is this she has a bunch of women's names who are tagged on the tweet\nAnd she says and this person or just a few of the black women running for office this year black women have consistently shown up at the polls but are still under represented in elected office we can change that in November elect black women\nAnd of course my response to that is very direct although it's seemed to be true for some time now I Want to thank Kamala Harris senator Kamala Harris for removing all doubt she's a bold faced blatant racist imagine if you will\nAt real Donald Trump posting between like this saying elect white men let that sink sink in and then I I put ... racist\nThat is the epitome of a racist weight of course there's so many years you said prejudice racist is not the right word\nActually do you even have an idea of what the definition of racist is this is actually from the dictionary on on on line a person who shows reveals discrimination or prejudice against people of other races or who believes at a particular racist superior to another\nKamala Harris bronco Obama they will denigrate any other race to put themselves or who they identify with a head\nIt is not OK in my America this equal opportunity\nThis post MLK America post the civil rights act from Nineteen sixty four America and it's not okay to say from ... an elected I she's an elected office elect black woman that's not okay because she's basically saying\nI Am racist against white men or white women it's actually all men white women Asian women\nHispanic woman American indian women Arab women and she gets away with it like that it's okay they said listen it's not okay and if it makes you feel good to see her post something about elect black women\nWhich is just they just absolutely on encumbered racist thing to say if you think that it's OK you're also part of the problem\nI see what the left is doing and I find it not just just like this Robert Frances calls himself that though ... saying\nThat the police of the modern day Jim Crow he clearly has no idea what Jim Crow was that he's on the same side of the same political party as created Jim Crow and push Jim Crow\nHe has no idea how much harder it makes it for police officers out there every day of the week to deal with the community when you've got a so called leader in the community\nTouting the praises of we're actually not even talking to praises pushing the ... of Jim Crow on our police officers today that makes it exponentially harder for them to do their jobs and to get along with any community it doesn't make any sense\nBut then again you have a guy who's who's being presented to people in Texas and across the land as a fresh face new to politics guess what here's a little here's a little bit of a a breaking news um spot for ya\nRubber afraid so Rourke was elected the same day Ted Cruz was elected six years ago\nThat's the truth he's been in Congress as long as Ted Cruz has been he's not a new face he's infected will face he's a face to spit in there for a long time you just didn't hear about him because he hasn't done anything\nHe's done nothing legislatively he's part of the three or four things were cruises part of three dozen things if not more\nAnd and he went on I didn't see this last night but I've only seen a snippet or to uh what do you have to say last night\nFrom this town hall and CNN\nAnd he went on and on about how he had to call Ted Cruz alarm because he's just going to lie and be dishonest yet he has he didn't say one thing about what it was Cruz lied about\nIn fact Ted Cruz the figure was accused of lying about has posted O'Rourke vote on that ten dollar a barrel surcharge or tax for for oil rich resource here it was state of Texas\nBut again you've got lawyers cheaters racists on the left and for some reason they're getting traction and I want to ask you if you're thinking of voting for somebody who's a Democrat who's a leftist who was a a racist or a lawyer like these people that I'm Talking about\nAre you stupid or you ignorant\nOr the third option is do you really believe that what they're saying would make for a better America don't let me define what I mean by that\nAnd and a lot of you are are up in arms you know they just medical just to ... myself\nYou're stupid person if you say I'm going to vote for that person because I just don't believe all the facts\nThat people like ... or or a cruiser Trump had been bringing about what the left just want to do I'm aware of them but I don't believe them even though they've proven to be correct I think that makes your stupid\nIf you're ignorant I think that you're the person that vote for somebody like an Obama or an old ... Kamala Harris because you like the way they look for you like the way to make you feel when you get a thrill up your leg or you had a sex dream about on the night before which allegedly women were doing about Obama\nThat means that you're ignorant which is you're ignoring what's known about these people which known about O'Rourke Betty the police report says he tried to leave the scene of a DWI accident in the late Nineteen nineties he's lying about announcing that he didn't do that\nHe's lying about Ted Cruz\nYou know going right Adam point by point on his actual votes in his positions he's saying things like I Want to work across the aisle and I I Will work with the president United States well he's also the guy who wants to impeach the president you know think about that\nSo if you still want this guy\nAnd you haven't paid any attention to what he's actually stood for what he stands for what he's done and what he said I find you to be ignorant but you're ignoring what's actually available for you because otherwise I don't think you're stupid 'cause if you actually stopped ignoring it and pay the picture the facts you probably would make a better decision\nOr you're somebody the third person is somebody who really does believe and you want socialism and you liked that anti fires closing down roads in Portland and treating the residents are like crap as the mayor states by does nothing can tells the police to stay down maybe you want a United States of America where we disarm and disband ice and the police\nMaybe you want an America where people pay fifty sixty Seventy eighty percent tax on their hard working hard labor maybe you want an America where your four O. one K. grows at a at a pace of about a hundred dollars a year maybe that's the America you want and I actually had more respect for the third person than I Do the first to\nGo to the third person actually as as wrong as they are they\nActually are firmly standing on what it is they want in the country if you just want some of the girls are good looking or they make you feel good when you hear him speak there's something wrong with you you're being ignorant\nAnd if you're a person who actually she's the facts in front of you and says I Want to learn and base my vote on the facts and you're actually looking at the facts and you're still saying do believe that you're just stupid\nWhich one are you just wake up to wonder if that's the way to come out of the box Rogers which one are you are you're stupid ignorant or you're somebody who actually believes this\nTom Courtney oh the popular meat in

on the show many times like the mayor run Nuremberg who's got to be one and done he's scared to death so come on this program because he knows unlike CNN and I'm like MSNBC I'm not going to Rome softball so I'm going to ask them direct questions to back up the garbage he says on Twitter and the garbage\nShe says out there in in um in the public square he's a guy who um has never as far as I Know done anything for all San Antonio and Austin Antonio's he seems to do things for specific special interest groups and he seems to really\nLive in the world of identity politics and he hates Donald Trump to know why he just never really explain what his problem is\nWith the president other than he he's a Castro brother from San Antonio ... said either you once while I'm going to let him get away with what he said on CNN I was I was telling you about it before the break\nHe goes on CNN and he's being asked about this guy to show that you know again I'm not that familiar with is this a journalist I don't read the Washington Post I don't read newspapers generally speaking at all they most of the time are very left leaning and and I don't want to want to be polluted by fake news\nBut the guy I guess was an outspoken person about Islam shutting down or Saudi Arabia shutting down free speech or journalism or whatever that's the way it's been reported he was a Saudi journalist who wrote for the Washington Post who went to the Saudi embassy in Turkey\nSo it's all very convoluted already again before this story I had not heard of him before I'm just not somebody who follows writers on newspapers\nHaving said that he goes and never comes out the allegation is he was killed there\nA hit squad is simple it from the Saudi Government or somebody or or the Saudi ... you know a family\nTo kill him he never leaves\nAllegations are you just cut up he was buried somewhere you take it he was dismembered whatever I don't know what the story is the president now in the past day President Trump has said that yes the guy's dead and that Saudi Arabia the the the family the royal family there that runs the joint they say they don't know what happened to him they didn't do anything\nWe don't know what the endgame is going to be we don't know what the real story is of the details are extremely sketchy that's true so walking Castro knowing that goes on CNN yesterday or the day before\nAnd it says this will be listening to what he's saying\nI Know that there's been a lot of discussion about this there'll be more discussion on CNN and all the other networks today let me get to the point that I think is the most disturbing right now the reporting that Jared Kushner may have with U.S intelligence delivered a hit list an enemies list\nTo the crown prince to NBS in Saudi Arabia and that the prince then may have acted on that and one of the people that he took action against Mr ... getting kicked\nAnd they're not that we have I just find that there are many or we

know he's dead after they said that he wasn't with what he's gone even though they they said that he walked out um that didn't happen so we now we have to figure out why he's dead or who killed them and and go from there what's interesting to me\nIs there's\nAn outcry by the left in this country for the current president Donald Trump\nTo do something you've got to take action against Saudi Arabia now is he going to take action I don't remember not one of nearly one person on the left in this country\nSaying anything about about the Obama taking action against the the terrorists in Benghazi who killed her for Americans including including the are are are ambassador\nNot one of these people said that in fact they the media allowed the left to perpetrate a lie\nInstead that's what they did\nThey allow the president the administration to perpetrate a lie about some video that ended up in the deaths of four Americans\nNow I don't want journalists killed I don't want a guy walking to to get documents to get married to end up dead I I Want there to be a swift investigation and Turkish officials happened in Turkey Saudi constantly there to do the job to find out what happened in and get this story right\nWhat do we have to do with it I I don't I don't understand what we have to do with it\nNow when our ambassador dies and three other Americans die in defense of the ambassador events or consulate you damn straight we should have something to do with it but what what does this have to do with us and why is it somehow Donald Trump's problem\nAnd last hour I actually showed you a piece of video and play the audio of walking Castro a far left wing Democrat or who hates the president for no reason other than he can\nMade the suggestion\nWell actually said he saw reports that have been made aware of reports\nSaying Jared Kushner the president's son in law and a top advisor to the president gave a hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the crown prince then took action on it and that's what happened to your show ... that's what this guy walking Castro say let's keep in mind\nEarly voting starts Monday you see walking Castro's name think twice because that's the guy who's going to represent you in San Antonio\nNow of course he said oh no no I I never suggested Jared Kushner Tibet which is which is actually exactly what he did say exactly what he said\nDemocrats represented walking cash for looking at my computer screen overhear\nBacks away from claim cushion ordered this a member of the house intelligence committee said Trump's son in law deliberate a hit list to the Saudi ... a crown prince who's accused of ordering the hit on cars Yogi that's basically what Joaquin Castro said\nNow he's backing away from it because why because he got caught\n'cause poppy or already was poppy Harlow I didn't realize were lessons roller a because she called them out\nPretty disgusting if you ask me disgusting what he said it's unforgivable to suggest that the president's son in law gave a hit list to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who ordered the hit on a good show ... because of the list\nThat's disgusting is what it is disgusting\nIt

the guy that they they the guy that got ... that killed that this is ... is one of the biggest arms dealers in Saudi Arabia 'cause he was asked to the family and they were\nThey were very close knit family I think the thing that is going on in here in the Clinton called friends to watch the water ice so there may be a lot of these people are against it including donors that got killed he was against it he was going to exploit this guy saying hey\nThis is a Muslim country they don't want to bring less than ...\nWell actually I got to tell you I don't know much about ... show gave the guy who's now dead I don't know much about him but what I Do know is he was allegedly an outspoken person who believed in freedom of the press why would you want a more ... more more Islamic rule if he was a freedom of the press guy\nWhat no actually I don't I don't think that's the case but I\nMean that's what's been rebuilt it again I don't know anything about him I'm going on the reports\nJust going to want to read and\nI Know about that and then she'll get because I've been reading a couple of books about many years ago that he was one of the biggest arms dealers\nAre in the in the world

that you know I Know that but that's basically what's being talked about that because he's he's like he was very close\nIt down can I just ... can you give me a source because what you're saying whether the opposite of what I heard\nI I actually read it on a couple of races where never what it is but yeah it it it's in Yahoo News I think it was\nA guy Yahoo News he loses the same but I

problem you know for those who do want ...\nSo it it's the exact opposite of what you're saying is what I've heard again I'm not an expert on the show family or who's dealing arms or who's or whatever but I'm not going to go on some report that\nDumb I Love you and I believe that you you saw somewhere but I'm gonna have to have their report in front of me that that would actually make me say okay
