club there called the office\nAnd like I don't know and like I said before I'm offended by that I Would never go there and I'll never go back but the office\nAre played into that heavily and and when you went in there they all wars business suits and stop very just classy\nGirls and I'm sure they're all doctors and lawyers now but [laughter]\nThe older they were working their way through school they said they were working their way through school yeah absolutely well I think it's a good suggestion Jeremy Jeremy what's your what's your wife approve of you go into the office\nSo long as she was making as long as she came in ah hey tomorrow night we're all going to be at the retina country club for the five year anniversary you're going\nTo work the Texas a festival with the wife oh\nCan I ask your opinion about that a couple of years ago my wife and I went\nAnd we went lights I mean we went late like we got up we had my mother in law and my sister in law staying in town with us so\nWe worked so we had breakfast on a Sunday and then we drove there\nNow this is where the nightmare starts we sat in we sat in a line of traffic and somebody kept coming up to our car and saying don't worry it's just a little longer dude I'm not exaggerating Jeremy we sat in our car for three hours and then finally I'm just talking about it was an hour to get there so we're talking about for our we're really at a certain point I was like I could takes no more\nAnd we did it you're turning drawback I've been to the rent past before it's actually a really fun time is there a way around that has the situation improved what do I do if I Want to go there with my wife\nI'm honestly the best we can go to you know travel is early in the morning\nAnd they get their cause to opening up for the the up towards magnolia ... about ten o'clock\nWe're told that the local government part of the reason why that's the case is the local government will not let people that are trying to access the rent fast use the side streets like apparently the the local government they're just not appreciate the fact that ren fest brings all this business of the community is that true local from\nWhat I understand the local government is not that much of an issue what they're more concerned about safety because I mean if you're at it that many cars coming and going oh of course in nature you're going to have people that are irritated with traffic so therefore [laughter]\nGo ahead and somebody going to get on and that's going to absolutely screw everything\nUp valid valid point it's a beautiful area of like oh you're of the suburbs of Houston I mean it's great out there I totally get why they built that plays the ren fest has been going on for a long time and I saw these old photos of chicks in the seventies at random fast and and can I tell you what most of the photos Rob Jeremy\nI'm I've probably seen them and it\nIs very very X. rated a lot of nudity I mean it was it was ...\nIt was right after the summer of love and it was just ... naked girls with swords walking around it was it was a very interesting thing\nAnyway it's family friendly you know it's and I think that when you\nGo to run fast it's still a little bit on family for their states family friendly but to a point but up to a point would you describe it that way Germany\nIs family friendly up to a point you have to be careful which like do not take your kids into the polish to watch Irish rose up\nInto that what you might not have gotten you know explain that again to what\nAdvantage there is a couple of shows out there like Irish and the polish area yeah no they definitely inform the beginning of the show um if you have kids I strongly suggest you take the hallway [laughter]\nOkay there you go I think I pretty much Jeremy you're perfectly sir I appreciate your call me and\nSay hey how's it going man that was Germany recline open phone lines folk seven when three two one two five nine five zero if anybody wants to cause before the show and a great reminder there from Germany as he brought up run fast I almost forgot about this new story did you hear about the the\nQueen of Sweden now there's this little girl she's eight years old little girls at a lake with their mom and dad they're all wearing their bathing suits and they're swimming and the little girl pulls a sword out of this lake okay so now this eight year old girl has discovered a pre Viking Eris sword\nIn a Swedish lake she's now she's being called the queen of ... of the queen of sweat and well\nI mean setting aside setting up a system of government based on the fact that he watery tart hands us sort out of the lake is doesn't seem like a really good idea\nOkay but doesn't that sound like a better system and what they currently have their well they do have the king and queen and so we already but Swedish I apparently this little girl's name is ... right and I was making money python right know that you were and I love that and I love that about you but but I don't expect people in Texas to understand British comedy and I don't get it either [laughter]\nAnyway Swedish American soccer ... found that ancient artifact playing in vitro strong leg did I say that right I probably close enough to map right it was during summer her family holiday was going on their holiday means vacation in Europe you know they are they kept saying even\nRunning [laughter] and you know what else choose me up European people when they when they numerically right the date\nYes well I\nI hate that they'll put the filter ...\nPut the days the then the month than a year\nAnd it always screwed me up is this is this taking place in January or December I Can't figure it out anyway so this little girl found the sword the shortage Fifteen hundred years old that's actually really cool isn't that really cold just a little girl just picked it up and now ... and now she's the leader of sweet and that's\nHow they are [laughter] I think\nIt's really neat anyway um anyway I I feel like at the end of the day that's just a really neat thing that's ... that happened at Swede and today I appreciate that little Swedish girls need to hold storage and ... and control the country 'cause I 'cause otherwise people might be confused into believing it's the sweet it's a socialist mission right would you uh would you go to Sweden and try to find a sort of become queen of the country\nAbsolutely my grandfather's from Sweden so I should go is I've been there actually are you speaking I see\nAs far as I'm just I'm just making one more to Mars burgers burgers raw that's what's Swedish people sound like me and when German people talk it does it didn't stop\nWhere German people so angry all the time\nI don't know what people down to set off the Germans I don't know what it is still you know about this apparently in the middle of the twentieth century they were not very nice to the Jews DNA I I heard that yeah I heard that too earlier we put a question our I we only have two minutes left here so let me take this call real quick earlier in the show I asked\nPeople ask why I asked the guy worked in the steel industry or how the tariffs represent were affecting people and this is not an attack on Trump but I don't like the tear up or Cory short answer we have like one minute wiped what did you want to say about that\nUm you you know of all they talk you out or you know I Would say probably about April the you know they had a poster I'm\nAt the front office saying you know the prices up within the next month going to be you know like five percent or something like that I'm Sorry I Know that's the only thing I've seen is as far as dealing pretty much everything you steal\nBut five but five percent is a big deal when it affects the entire industry Korean I bet you and thank you for your call man because I I think that\nI think it matters I taxation is stopped tariffs are a form of taxation socialist nations love tariffs and and socialism is extortion and that's all that I could say about that I'm Kevin is\nYour junior I Want to make sure we buried for having us doing it for him today I Want to make the always beautiful and talented singer Peterson read her work and pursuit of happiness radio blood you can find it at Cape you ever see radio dot com don't forget to download the podcast I Love all of you that you so much for tuning in we will be back Monday morning with another live broadcast early in the morning before woman Johnson\nAnd live every afternoon a two PM taking your calls proceed happiness radio and Jimmy ... folks\n\nCloser to a vote I'm rich Dennison Fox News the\nSenate scheduled to vote tomorrow on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh whose path to the Supreme Court appears to be assured after two more senators say they'll vote confirmed the judge Fox is Jared helping joins us live from Capitol Hill\nAnd um she got a couple of new song settle you hear some of that later on as well so we've got a lot going on but what we are absolutely I'm so you got to my honest\nI'm tired of talking about cabinet ... the Supreme Court beginning some a left and how they're protesting I really yeah I mean I'm tired of it now because\nIt's just been a drone for the past how long have you been here two weeks three weeks almost a month\nNow so I Would say probably a little more than three weeks probably\nWasn't in Washington on the sixth and now the fifth so it's been almost a month ... I think that's\nWhen I say yeah I think you're right yeah it's it's been dragging a little bit\nEnough already yes they heard of it\nAll right so we've got done for you which is nice uh it will will do the complete rep I also want to talk about a message that I received on Facebook I'm not going to name the lady she lives in San Antonio but what you do that when they start like this I always loved your show because I felt drawn biased you know that you're in trouble then right\nMm oh yeah\nThat point you're in trouble now you're in deep doo doo if you will as French the French term so um it goes on and on and then and then tries to light up because she says I made fun of or laughed at at Ford I don't think I did\nIn fact I'm I'm almost positive I didn't make fun of Christine Ford although I have no problem saying I don't believe that she's remembering an assault by Brett Kavanaugh I Believe that she may have been sexually assaulted\nAnd actual horrible for and I think the Dianne Feinstein completely um screwed her on the whole deal did not\nHold on to her her privacy did not offer the anonymity that she wanted and some buddy met office leaked it and Feinstein that was after find science out of this letter for two months\nBut as far as Christine Blasey Ford in her allegations against this guy specifically clearly it didn't happen that way because nobody else will corroborate everybody she's named in fact refused that it happened and\nA ... ... whatever happened to her I feel bad and I hope that you'll get to the bottom of it and the person responsible will be\nWill get the correct justice but it wasn't ... capital so I'm not really sure what am I going to read her entire along Facebook message and it don't debate on Facebook if you want to call me and have a debate on the air all do that but I'm going to debate on Facebook at ... I Will never get away from the computer if I Do that\nBut if you want to ... used to love the show they used to be entertained it's still entertained did ... he's just this week we tell fart jokes all the time carry hello that's right there is now or not if you're coming relief so one show what I'm saying\nDon't write me about how entertaining the show used to be used to think that I was a fair journalist that I was unbiased let me be as clear as I can\nWhen I give you the information on the stories that uncovering\nI Will give you the information via carry my news anchor who is even handed she's got to give you the the streets Guinea's good until you sources\nGonna give me information on the story then I Will give you my opinion according to the fact that we know we always base I always base my opinion on fact I always base my fun on fact those base my entertainment on fact this is how we do it on this program is one of the program is so successful I I'll never understand how somebody here's something different than what we're actually doing\nSo I'm Carrying you don't mind give me the the latest the nuts and bolts of what happened to them a lot happened today and last band upon that for a second because the tactic by the Facebook writer\nWas actually very simple you don't care about victims of sexual assault because of the way you active for this whole thing\nAnd then she ended up you know attacking the president to President Bush and the president that Kevin and Kevin of that ... and then at the end of it you know she says oh by the way I'm a Republican I don't believe you are I don't believe your unless you don't know the Republican actually believes\nCertainly innocent till proven guilty certainly corroborate the story certainly if it's been refuted you don't have to just keep on believing that had happened\nYou're going to do is actually I think harms the ability of true victims to come forward and be believed\nEspecially the Ramirez and and the sweating the allegations me those are ridiculous now the first one I Do believe that Christie\nAfford something happened to her we should figure it out she she figured out and get some justice in her life had nothing in my opinion to do with Brett Kavanaugh and my opinion is based on the facts by the FBI\nBy the seven FBI background checks and by the the the Senate Judiciary committee I don't understand why anybody believes the left on that committee and fix that they're telling the truth\nAnd the argument that if you believe cabinet over Ford you don't care about victims of sexual assault is a species argument at best in fact it's an educated even though I deliver like a sister All right if you don't mind a carry give us the nuts and bolts from today we'll take a break we'll come back tons of phone calls will get a very busy showed her that got\nFrom Fox News to nurses and Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia on friday they intend to vote in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nTwo crucial vote that appear to secure a cabinet confirmation to the nation's highest court moments after ... spoke on the Senate floor announcing our intention to know for the nominee mansion than the menu at all to vote to confirm Kavanaugh as well\nAnd that and say well he had reservations did a sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh to temperament is a quote I Believe he will rule in a manner that's consistent with our constitution\nConcept the confirmation resembled a caricature of the gutter level political campaign and criticize Democrats for announcing their opposition to Kevin album for his name was even an ounce\nAnd she also criticized outside groups for distorting Kavanaugh's record and over the top rhetoric and she began or speech to his interrupted by protesters urging her to know\nAnd it was flooded by protesters in the days leading up to the vote with activists pounding Republicans and urging them to vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation planning decades old sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh protesters also yelled shame that mansion after his statement\nAnd ... claims Kavanaugh would be a part of the judge noted he had ruled in favor of parts of Obamacare and ruled against the Bush era terror conviction\nAnd she also says she was a sharing a cabin I Would not overturn roe v Wade the Nineteen Seventy three decision that found that constitutional right to abortion she also a jacket concerns by Democrats and that is temperament and that he was out of the judicial mainstream\nConned made her announcement on the Florida Senate hours after the chamber of voted fifty one forty nine to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to a final vote on Saturday evening Collins is one of four key undecided senators are closely watched for how they would know\nCollins along with Senator Jeff flake and Senator Joe Manchin voted to invoke cloture on the nomination earlier friday\nSenator Lisa Murkowski voted no and in the to just think she may vote against cabin on Saturday\nBlankets adjusted he would vote yes for Kavanaugh left something big changes within fifty one forty nine majority in the Senate Republicans cannot afford more than Wendy facts in the fall Democrats were developed together that mansions he asked given the Republicans the cushion\nAnd Collins mansion inflate the I Am Murkowski vote nay that will get Kavanaugh fifty one vote and senator Steve Gaines maybe apps and the the the pending his daughter's wedding on Saturday were not the case it would be fifty to forty nine which would be enough to confirm Kavanaugh without a tie breaking vote needed to be cast by nice president might Penn\nSo interesting doings now the the whole dating situation is interesting I guess I mean they don't have to vote on this\nExactly thirty hours later right I mean they could vote on this sometimes Sunday and the wedding is tomorrow I'm right I understand they've got a jet standing by to take him was in North Dakota\nAnd Montana\nMontana okay so I said they've got a plain standing by ready to take him I'm ... and he's right he's right to not want to miss his daughter's wedding and he should not miss her wedding to take part in this vote but they've got to figure out if you've got the votes or not before either letting him go or they've got a schedule devoted a time where they know they can get him back\nTo vote so it could happen some day I mean that just gives the the radical left another full day to attack and and cause mayhem but it sounds to me like\nIntelligent cooler heads have prevailed I was just calling speak today and show first of all she's annoying to listen to adjust your tone of voice or just to me it's a it's a bit annoying but having said that she very slowly very methodically laid out exactly why she's voting for him and everything she said is right\nI'm not really sure what the argument is on the other side other than wind of you know the ... came from and and every single somebody she even though I mean you've got this Blumenthal idiot lied about Vietnam\nSuddenly some constituent of his contact that his office at had\nCredible information that Brett Kavanaugh reached out to the spouse of a of a witness or something\nAnd what we're supposed to do to stop the vote stopped the process of getting what another FBI investigation shut up man yeah at some point it just has to stop it wasn't he the guy on the panel Kerry who said once you lied to me pretty much do you believe anything you say\nI Do believe that is the man and he gave\nYou gave some some Latin term and I don't know what it is legally speaking but basically means that well he lied about Vietnam why should we listen to anything the city of says just put it out there it is a editing nine four one packs a day nine four one Seventy two four seven Joe packs dot coms there either\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nWhat you guys have blood recast you hear from you I Know that it was all sketchy about how she became a U.S senator anyway and there's a now famous or infamous or notorious picture and you've probably seen the dry carry a Feinstein like almost you know\nIn Murkowski's faces were Cal she's leaning against the wall oh it was Dianne Feinstein the wind is somebody I mean that\nMen I have seen that many times\nSo I mean it is this who who your senator is Alaska is ... ... is is this the person you want representing you because I I heard it a very specific thing today I heard rush for about five minutes today you guys know what I was in a whole lot of talk radio but I happen to have it on in between music and it'd be three phone calls today\nAnd he said something that really did hit home and I think it was it might even been Sean I heard somebody for about five minutes that I carry maybe you were in one of these guys you were in the studio I'm not sure who said it but\nIf ... if this Supreme Court justice doesn't get confirmed and if the Democrats were to get the Senate in November which doesn't look like it's going to happen but let's just play the game the court would be eight to eight and as we talked about yesterday\nWhen the court is eight to eight if they tire on rulings a lot of things would be a tie\n\nThe previous court ruling which stand you know with court the circuit court of appeals deals with Alaska\nI down\nIn the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in San Francisco it is the most liberal court in the United states of America those of you in Alaska listen to me clearly in a lot to be listed we get great ratings in Alaska\nAre here to tell you your lives will be then the judge did\nBuy that court the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in in San Francisco California I'm Talking about your gun rights I'm Talking about your your freedoms and liberties you take so seriously in Alaska you better get on the voter Lisa Murkowski let her know what's up\nBecause if she votes if she votes them down to a ... a a Dianne Feinstein she's appeasing San Francisco and not doing the bidding and ... and representing that she should be doing for Alaska that's real\nAgain the Ninth Circuit court of appeals is the next lowest court\nBelow the Supreme Court and at the Supreme Court can't decide your life will be will be I don't want to see what what's the word I'm looking for your not judicial lives it's certainly not\nI Would guess scrutinized by the nicer to court of appeals that would be the judge and jury that controls your freedoms and your liberties should this candidate B. voted down and should be the Democrats get the Senate now\nMurkowski can vote against cloture and I'm not sure why she did that and still vote for him and then maybe she saved her political life\nWill be interesting to see is if Murkowski comes around and others come around if they know for a fact that he's going to get confirmed because at that point Kerry what happens is these lawmakers who were voted in by the people\nAre going to go no no he's going to be confirmed I'm coming from a red state I said no to his confirmation for no good reason knowing I couldn't stop it I might as well jump on the bandwagon and say well look I voted for cabinet is what you wanted\n\nSo you might actually see as many as many people are saying it's going to be fifty one forty nine tomorrow next to bet but it'd be fifty one forty nine or even fifty to forty nine or ... guys in there\nIt might be fifty two fifty three fifty four by the end of the day here with mentioned voting for him as well and we know that he's going to it should at least be fifty two forty eight\nBut if any Republican vote the other way Alaska I'm telling you vote that asks out it's really that simple there's there is no good reason\nWhy Murkowski would say no other than Diane Feinstein has some control over her that I hadn't heard about before it's a editing\nNine for one pack said it eight nine four one Seventy two four seven J.

food sorry what what do you have or me\nFrom the daily lie or a woman that Christine Blasey Ford claimed was at the party where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her circa Nineteen eighty two so that the I investigate or is the doctor for the allies tried to pressure her and it change your story about what happened\nI mean like Kaiser told investigators that Ford's friend former FBI agent Monica McLean had urged her to alter the original statement she gave not remembering any such party and not knowing cabin on the wall Street Journal reported\nIn the journal noting Kaiser statement to the FBI offered a glimpse into how Dr forward to allies are working behind the scenes ... classmate to bolster their version of the alleged incidents\nDoors closed the situation told the journal the doctor for its friends including that's been clean and contacting their Kaiser\nAfter initial statement to warn her that her stating that was being used by Republicans turn back the allegation against judge Kavanaugh stating that David last minute cleaned attorney denied the allegations writing any notion or claimed and that's the clean pressured Leyland Kaiser ultimate kinds of the county by she recall concerning the alleged incident between Dr foreign Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely false\nAnd the journal now to allies of cabinet also reached out to people including former classmate carrying our stoppage it said that she was asked to go on record about the allegation made by Deborah Ramirez\nAvoid that explained claimed this week in a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee for head coach McLean on how to pass the polygraph test so she could get into the FBI it's accusation with serious because of truth for purchases perjured herself under oath when she said she had never given anyone any tips on how to take a polygraph test\n\nMaybe maybe the guy in Grand Rapids is on to something\nMaybe there are some charge that to be examined deer maybe some people that should be some held to pay you can't bring somebody and his entire family through the mud and get away with it if you're making stuff up or if you're pressuring people changed their stories for political ends it'll be interesting to see if there will be an investigation here let me grab a Steve who's in Minnesota Steve what's on your mind I\nIf\nKennedy doesn't step down and Kavanaugh isn't nominated\nOr anybody and trust me anybody would have been in that list would have been nominated would have been assaulted and attacked verbal E N and an accusation wise\nJust as as Brett Kavanaugh was this is not unique to Brett Kavanaugh they didn't care who it was and that was actually you know shown to be true that night that he was nominated when they were actually Sharpie pending in the name because they weren't shortly before people who are the front runners who the person was going to be they had made up signs already they just didn't have an Avon and yet\nThey had emails that went out immediately um some of them actually just said space space for blank blank for the name of the judge 'cause they didn't feel it in this has to be they were\nSo this was going to happen no matter who the nomination went to if Kennedy the Kennedy those to step down before the midterms I think there's a really good chance that the house in the Senate both go to the Democrats I really do believe that\nI really do believe that because Republicans or conservatives were just busy enjoying the lower taxes higher pay the higher pay checks the ability to go out to eat and go shopping some more\nUm there were enjoying the fact that where they didn't have any jobs available during Obama's there are plenty of jobs now and people are going back to work in fact there are more jobs than workers available to build them\nWe've economically we're doing incredibly so when you get sort of fat like that and and\nThings start getting better free economically\nYour bank account you don't pay as much attention to politics because things are going well happy days are here again then this happens Kennedy steps down and cabin on now is the guy who's nominated and again keep in mind and I stand from five as it doesn't matter who was nominated they were going to try to do this to whoever it was\n\nSo he's nominated and suddenly we start paying its I lose Kevin okay and then we hear you know he's he's he's answering the questions right he's got this great history people in the left or suggesting that he that he be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAnd the Democrats who all ... or guaranteeing themselves that they were going to win the house and Senate back all in here um what's going on here\nIs guys look a little bit too squeaky clean\nWhich this story here we're we're in deep trouble it will stop this I mean I'm Talking about you're going to have a traditional American values Supreme Court for the next thirty forty years it will do something to stop this guy\nSo yes it was about abortion\nYes it was about a socialist looking America yes it was about legislating from the bench you know they they like Kagan they like sort of my or they like you know better Ginsburg bail like people who see a very liberal very left to sort of view of our constitution\nAnd our our rights and our freedoms the right doesn't\nThe Gorsuch in ... an elite Owen Roberts generally Roberts when it all the time and if this guy gets on there they see it as here is the framework here is in stone the way this country is\nConstituted this is\nOur foundation like a foundation of the building and it's not movable you can't move the foundation which is laid I guess you can but not much\nSo if if it says this that's how we should rule if it says that that's how we should rule the life says well it says that we should probably think that maybe abortions a privacy issue what it says this we should probably say well although marriages it in there which you just say everybody can get married gay straight whatever\nSo\nYou're you're you're looking in a court that scares the hell out of them because it will be based in the actual truth that our founding fathers put in this document that was meant to restrict an overwhelming overpowering over wielding\nGovernment they don't like that\nThey want the government to have the control now they've got their millions and the indoctrinated masses who think of government has the control I somehow benefit socialism I benefit you'll take from the rich guy the evil rich guy and give it to me\nWhereas wealth has never been a zero sum game that in this country no freedoms and liberties capitalism in free enterprise is not a zero sum game if you've got a million dollars it doesn't mean I Can't have some but I won't have some of yours but I can go out and work for it and get it myself\nIf you have a really nice car I could work really hard to go get a really nice car too I don't need you to give me your car\nI don't need you to downsize your house and get one that's the same size of mine and make me feel better\nIt's not a zero sum game in a capitalistic free enterprise society we all have the ability through guaranteed equal opportunity that has to be guaranteed um it's not equal then you can but at the equal opportunity is really available and it is because it's a lot in this country\nThen you have the ability to go in and do for yourself and your family and and your friends in your neighborhood\nYou have that ability I don't need the government and believe me I used to be ... I was so poor that wasn't an artist at the end of the word I was ... but I didn't need the neighborhood together money up for me and handed to me out of their own paychecks I didn't need higher taxes so the government could tell me that I have a little bit more\nI just worked a few extra jobs\nThat's the way it's supposed to work in the land of opportunity is that the land of overwhelming government although it seems like it is lately it's not the the land of socialism is not the land of tape from him to give it to that guy is the land of opportunity take the opportunity and do something with it\n\nAnd and do something with that I mean something other than complain that it's not fair so we are now looking at a midterm election that will decide if we go forward in a society that believes in capitalism free enterprise and a a a document that lists\nFor restrictions on the government's overwhelming ability to control us you know what is it doesn't say you have the right to free speech it says the government shall not restrict\nThis that the other government shall not passed any law does this that the other\nWords like shall not be infringed do by the government in parentheses appear in the document all over the place have you ever read the constitution it is to see what your rights are it says what the government can't do\nObama always screwed that up and self he seemed to think that it was some sort of a list of rights and it wasn't a a list of negative something against the yes it is it actually the way it's worded it's a list of the things the government can't do it's a list of restrictions on big government it's a list of how we are going to stop tyranny from ever happening again here\nAnd that's all going to go by the wayside if you get people on the court and voted in in one month's time they don't believe in the founding principles of the founders all had slaves\nThey have in the founding document the ability to amended to right wrongs to to fix issues that we deal with I mean this was a masterful thing to put together\nSlavery doesn't exist anymore because the founding document allows for people to say it's gone it's out it's over it's abolished\nYou've been to the past few weeks it'd be unsettling to every freedom loving American in the nation due process has been laid to waste by a mob of angry Democrats and their supporters Senator Chuck Grassley\nWhat we have learned is the reason that has existed since the day after the November sixteenth plenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on\nOptics move crazy amounts of data and even crazier speed and fight us by horizon is be one hundred percent fiber optic network\nWith ... connection you'll get the fastest Internet available download speeds up to nine hundred and forty makes TV phone at a two year price guarantee over Seventy nine Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement plus get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google in that smart home devices and a one hundred dollar be super\nCapitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nAnd he's right the Democrats want to silence and punish anyone who opposes their agenda\nWhen you hear things about get in their face while other people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member theater coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society\nShameful days indeed and that's this week at the Fox news corner of the world have a Good Friday and be sure to go to church this weekend and pray pray for our nation America I'm\nDodged orange is the biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already of music\nDo miss the iconic performances\nTo watch our must see I have read music festival this Sunday and Monday Night is Seventy em on C.
