{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "But it is a is move\nSlowly and surely more and more and more and more and more to the left\nAnd they are just all in on ... just in time for the election there was an artist who is put up a quote unquote inspirational mural\nWhich portrays back to work as a superhero yep on bugging his shirt to reveal uh BU underneath you know like Superman only with the beef or Beethoven\nAnd to make the image complete the depicted the Texas flag pictured as a K behind him\nBecause after all that do work is done so many great things of the state of Texas\nI still love that clip we played yesterday in fact\nIt back a sisters as you get your age used it today or portions of it anyway\nFor a story there doing tomorrow\nAbout um you know how young people don't really know anything about they tore them they think he's\nHe's young any school in his in these are Democrats and therefore we should vote for him the other thing about his track record they don't know anything about his background they don't know anything about what he would do is the United states senator and they just don't really care\nThat they don't know anything about it and that's fine uh we're doing that story tomorrow in ... because we are going to do a segment on\nThe voting age which as you know as a team now when I was Eighteen years old again here I'm going to go all ramp on you when I was Eighteen years old I\nThink I was a little bit more mature than your average Eighteen year old is today and I I'm not blaming your average Eighteen year old today I'm blaming him plenty of the parents of that average Eighteen year old\nBecause we have caused all they're protected our children so much and we are so afraid of them failing in some way shape or form of that we we we just over protected them\nAre so they're not prepared a and they're not required to make any adult decisions at the age of Eighteen when I was Eighteen years old I was already working and going to school I had my own apartment\nI had moved out of my parents' home\nI had my own car and my own car payment and those are the kinds of things that\nHelp you to a tree to achieve adult status so whether I should add or not I was probably one of the more mature Eighteen year olds who to go in and vote in election there's there's there's a question as to whether or not\nEighteen is inappropriate for boating anymore whether or not we need to raise the age of what we can assume an adult is from Eighteen to\nTwenty one or maybe Twenty one is not far enough either yeah is your average Twenty one year old is matures your average Twenty one year old was ten years ago twenty thirty forty years ago however long ago that we need to take it up even further twenty five before we allow you\nTo have a decision and who are leadership and what our public policies are going to be\nYou know we've always thought it'd be better if we could somehow have an informed electorate were never ever going to have a completely informed electorate because some people do care about being informed and that isn't just Eighteen Nineteen twenty year olds that's thirty forty fifty year olds who just don't pay attention to what's going on\nSo I don't know the age limit is going to meet are going to have the more educated electorate but we'll debated tomorrow morning I get your each if you want to check that out between five and eight o'clock in the morning on Houston sporting is All right before we start to wrap up today\nThere was a word the president said during his rally and I I I think I mentioned this yesterday you know both show's blend together and so I don't remember what I said I'm would show but one of the words he used to go all fall or\nNot because I have a problem with the word not because I have a problem with the definition of the word but because I Know what kind of reaction is going to get is\nNationalism because people like white nationalism and they put the word white in front of it like white nationalism or they equated to Germany the rise of Germany during the twenties or thirties before World War two nationalism\nWell\nIt could be like anything else corrupted that way but the true definition of nationalism is the spirits or aspiration come into the whole of the nation devotion and loyalty to one's own country it's more about patriotism can you have excessive patriotism yeah you can\nBut generally speaking there's nothing wrong with nationalism and what else would you call make America First other than a patriotic realization that\nWe may be a part of the world but we have to take care of our own selves first\nThere was a couple of panelists both African American by the way who are on Fox talking about this one of them very negative towards that Donald Trump and the whole idea of nationalism and he brought up and learn all that other stuff and then we had this guy\nWho is actually has a very state approach here's chorus Cooper or why he believes the president used the term nationalism\nThis president loves this country\nI watched during Hurricane Harvey when she went out and it was a volunteer helping to distribute goods and services if you watched the camera and you weren't paying attention to what the commentators are saying what you saw was a person that are like\nThe people that they encounter this president does voted to this country now it's a strange just form of racism than I ever seen that black Americans\nLatino Americans and even Asian Americans have done better in this country or relative to every other population the civil rights act was passed\nBecause blacks and minorities Clinton will get work now you've got five\n... unemployment achievement for black Americans\nThere you go\nThere's nothing wrong with using the word nationalism there's nothing wrong with being a national is\nThere is if your excluding a portion of your population is not forget what Adolf Hitler due to the Jews\nHow many of those people died in concentration camps but that's not the America we're looking at we're looking at America this very inclusive especially when it comes to economics we have become\nVery inclusive we have um\nWe have seen lives gotten better he's absolutely right about the unemployment rate historically low\nFor just about every group you can imagine historically low now I don't know how long it keeps up because after all the economy like anything else like you saw the stock market was down down down like six hundred points today\nSo we know there's gonna be blips along the way we know that the the bull market can last forever and it's going to go back around us and we know that if it does during this administration we know who's going to get the blame for that\nBut right now is that companies have to accept the blame for it and and and maybe some earnings reports that aren't quite what they should be [noise] you know it's a correction [noise]\nIt's a

crew pipe bomb sent it to former president high profile Democrat and CNN do York headquarters boxes ... has the latest line\nI'm politically speaking because of the large blocks of blue in the big cities it's a it's also generally speaking a Democrat or a blue state\nHaving said that he's up by seven which is a massively for Republican in that state and the left is starting to freak out a little bit so we've got all that going on we got all that to get to and then some\nAnd um but we also have this news that\nIf you pay attention to news this has been the big deal all day right Gary ... yes it's it's the the the package is being sent in the mail in ... it's very interesting how they were trying to get them from this person to that person they're all um high profile Democrats that are receiving these packages the media some of it all ready already alleging\nThat Trump's fault somehow in the rights fault and we'll talk about that certainly but if you can't give us the nuts and bolts in the very latest on what's going on with the investigation into what these packages are\nFrom Fox News packages containing suspected explosive devices were intercepted en route to some of the most prominent political figures in the country\nIncluding former president bronco Obama and Hillary Clinton putting law enforcement on high alert Wednesday and prompting evacuations in sleep several facilities CNN New York office was among those evacuated due to the discovery of an inherent explosive device\nLaw enforcement officers to the incident that peer related ended in life is a tearing up the pipe bombs law enforcement official directly involved in a nice big Asian tell Fox News the devices have similar packaging labeling and postage\nLeading investigators to believe that one person or group is responsible and its first public remarks and the packages which largely targeted democratic figures President Trump said Wednesday afternoon that advice is being inspected and a major federal investigation is now under way\nWe have to unify we have to come together and Trump said in the bill signing for opioid legislation\nActs are threats of political violence in any kind have no place in the United states of America\nAnd Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement Wednesday afternoon\nSaying that Trump's words ring hollow until he reverse of his statements that condoned acts of violence\nTime and time again the president's condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions and Schumer and Pelosi\nExpressing support for the Congress men who body slammed the reporter that neo Nazis and killed a young woman in Charlottesville has reporters at rallies that getting violent protestors\nDictators around the world who murdered their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy and the people in the last incident a law enforcement source told Fox News the Capitol police investigating a suspicious package address the Democratic California representative Maxine Waters\nAnd packages at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland\nRapidly evolving security scare went public when the secret service confirmed Wednesday morning at the officers in ... suspicious packages identified as potential explosive devices to Obama and Clinton\nSo it didn't take\nLong for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to lie about it didn't take long at all I mean blaming the president really doesn't make any sense Maxine Waters has been ... above violence and harassment by people on the left for a long time um I don't remember I don't remember I'm\nAnybody who was a mainstream Republican or conservative\nBlaming the left for the guy that showed up shooting people at the congressional baseball practice where Steve police almost died I don't remember people saying because that was a far left wing Bernie guy he he was a far left wing socially too actually showed up to kill Republicans\nBut it doesn't take people on the left Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi some media factions on the left to immediately blame the president and those are the right for the acts of clearly evil people\nNow yes all of these packages allegedly we're going to to Democrats\nThe way they were doing it and and carry correct me if I'm wrong but they were doing it on some of them\nIs they would send it to a bogus address but the return address would be like Deborah Debbie Wasserman Schultz ... yes that's right so they figured okay they couldn't deliver to the address on the package there would return it to the dismay of return address\nSo they'll find out all the packages I saw a very similar all of the alleged explosives really even know if they're real explosive shut\n'em look similar to me it is not okay\nIf you're somebody who believes in traditional conservative American values that's a good thing um but it it doesn't mean you try to scare or intimidate or kill the other side\nAnd frankly the other side is what's made known through the through the annals of history\nIn this country as the side of violence and and to residents so on I mean again Democrats or the party of the KKK of Jim Crow lynchings of slavery those are all Democrat or constructs they're all mechanisms are the Democrat Party they haven't changed much just where the plantation is\nThis change so the idea that somehow the Republicans are the conservatives are the ones that do things like this we're not\nSo if you're out there contemplating violence hey get help and be that's not how you when um when it comes to elections do I think that it could be a set up by somebody on the left trying to make it look like the writers doing this while the game as possible\nI don't know anything that would point to that being a fact but I also don't know anything that would point to a Republican or a conservative being the one who did this generally speaking when bad people do bad things they're just bad people\nNo matter what their brain told them would make sense you don't show up with with a rifle or or gun of any short to a congressional baseball practice looking to kill people but certain party you don't send packages looking to intimidate or hurt people of the opposite party that's not how you when\nWhen it comes to a political system to

in ...\nAnd there are medical records and witnesses people that care Monaghan spoke with shortly after the ... and reach out to the tune so there's overwhelming evidence or any allegations all very troubling\nWhat it is and here's the guy that was almost the head of the DNC\nHere's the garbage to lose a huge voice he's the vice chair of the DNC here's a guy that these allegations are two years ago with pictures allegedly there were videos there were nine one one recordings this has been from thirty six years ago but\nAs you know about a month ago everybody should Kevin I had to be guilty because one person said sometimes you really couldn't remember but Allison again but do you see I guess they did their own investigation do maybe there'll be enormous and they said well really get into really right\nSo the local state Democratic Party ... and they hired a law that they they use a quite often to do an investigation was really a sham investigation of the ... given\nFive hundred thousand dollars a democratic and is on the stage and I think fifty thousand dollars in campaign and wasn't independence at all and they concluded\nThat there is nothing to see here that do the right because it was not an independent investigations it was entirely a sham and the allegations are are serious and troubling in any other way of evidence for the people in Minnesota conclude the beginning to do to conclude that he's unfit to be the state's top GOP\nHe's a Republican running for attorney general the great state of Minnesota and you're right the job is the top cop\nAnd how do you how do you become a top cop when you're somebody who was wearing a shirt that says you know I'm no borders or or whatever you're up there and marching because you want as many refugees in Minnesota\nAs humanly possible how do you have you ... what does even running on a I'm going to enforce the laws I feel like and forcing because I get the ... from you that you're going to actually enforce the laws of the books\nYeah that's a very good for the last ... just make sure that the attorney general opposite unfortunately law that that's what the job is very similar and guilt and as a deputy sheriff Joe Democratic National committee\nReally going to get more political than it and he said during the debate on Sunday that evil you know not necessarily in Portland doesn't agree with that sort of the laws he doesn't agree with that that's just wrong because it's on ... and the executive branch ... if you wanted to make law they should have stayed in Congress\nI agree with you is it Doug ward low he's doing great to Republican running for attorney general ratio to Minnesota it's a great well here's the example of what you just said which was great um there are ... there are plenty of police officers who disagree with marijuana being illegal\nBut it's illegal and it's their job to arrest people who have a certain amount of marijuana on them each really vegetable there are certain police officers who think that I can drive Seventy five miles an hour down the road but the law says I've gotta stop at fifty five or sixty five and it's their job to pull me over to enforce the law why is there a gray area there I mean Eric Holder did this for for many years\nAs a as the attorney general of the United states you ignored immigration laws would ever President Obama wanted him to ignore him and pretend wasn't there he did and then when you questioned him on and he always called in race somehow so how is it\nWhy don't we get a day and age and your opinion Doug where where it's okay for attorney general on any level to say the laws don't matter\nIt it really is troubling I think you are a lot has become quite well this is Annette and that's because a except become so political ... at the federal level Eric Holder and ... a certain uh early on and judges things have become so political or looking at the law that at the natural result\nAnd it was very troubling about him is he walk he has said that he wants to use the Bush Jendayi he wants to see the president over and over and over and things from immigration to the Internet and try to push it all the agenda through the courts radical agenda or no less that's completely inappropriate\nAnd he's an executive promised to do it has to suit\nAs an end in debate he said he would do that you said he wouldn't do that he would bring lawsuits against the president and try to force policy change through the courts bypassing Congress bypassing the state legislature and that's just totally

I leave till the town of Fox News the highest priority for the FBI and that's what director Christopher Wray is saying about the theory the homemade bombs and was into high profile Democrats including former Presidents Clinton and Obama\nWhy would anybody who says I'm going to sue the president nonstop of the day I take office and uh I Believe in open borders I don't believe that we have any sovereignty I Believe that that Louis Farrakhan good gotta hang out with them why does that person have any chance in the United states of America so got people on the phone lines you want to talk about that let me let me add vis do it\nThis is true right the president the other day said he's a nationalist them much went nuts\nAnd that is true yes by definition do you know what a nationalist is a\nTimeline who's loyal devoted to their\nCountry and do all kinds of errors yeah that's the reason they believe in their nation\nYou know it used to be the one we would go to the Olympics and I don't even know that it's this ferocious anymore but it used to be that there would be allowed chance no matter where on the global was happening there will be loud chance of usa usa usa people would be holding up the United states flag the stars and stripes they would do that because of their pride in country\nSomehow the left has convinced people that if you say nationalism\nOr you're a nationalist you're a bad guy and that means that you're\nSomehow white supremacist somehow you have the Hitler white man right now are in fact Hitler yeah ... right so\nFor me we just listen words have definitions it's like illegal alien\nThe word does not mean extraterrestrial extra terrestrial literally means away from this way and away from the earth like in radio we say you got satellite radio you've got Internet radio you vet terrestrial radio terrestrial radios radio it's actually emanating from the ground here on earth\nExtraterrestrial means you're you're a or B from\nOutside of his globe outside of this planet saying but somebody is an alien just means they're not for where they are right now okay\nIt's not that hard illegal alien has a a very very simple definition you're alien to where you are you're a foreign person where you are now you're not from the place that you know our\n... and you got here illegally Syria legal person who did that saying that it's immigration it's not immigration it's illegal immigration those who do it or illegal aliens nationalism is very easily define you believe the nation\nYou say America First you say Americans first when I say America First\nI'm not saying white America First or black America first of all there are a lot of people below him who believe black America first are there are a lot of people who lack of old F ... the race that don't change their name to something else but that's who they are um they believe in in Latino\nOr Hispanic first there are people who believe in their identity politics first\nI Believe like the president believes and nationalism I Believe in America first and Americans first that means Americans no matter what your shade rescue is no matter what your course does have hair is or isn't no matter what your your your facial features are or whatever so\nIn the blank identifying mark you might have I Believe in this country first I Love the United states of America I Love our national anthem I Love our flag I Love our military I Believe in this land\nIt's really very very simple okay\nSo the bottom line is if I say I'm a nationalist and you find something negative you're the problem if I say I'm a nationalist and I believe in this country and you somehow try to make that upper majority of your the problem if you put\nA racial connotation in something that does not have a racial content\nYour the problem\nOkay get that through your head the media the fake news media cause real media doesn't doesn't do things like this but the fake news media that would make hay out of somebody saying he's a nationalist and pretend it's a negative in a horrible thing and it means that you're a pipe fill in the book\nThere the problem so what we need to do like\nLike begging tell me apologize for the for the whole black face thing which again I don't understand because she didn't really said black space she just said changes your skin tone um to better look like the person you're you're trying to look like on Halloween she apologizes emotional apology today and it'd be sick\nBecause New York and LA potentially and her bosses all freaked out so she thought the entire nation freaked out we didn't the entire nation understands that you're trying to look like somebody on Halloween costume the entire nation understands nationalism is a good thing and it's a positive thing for all people in this country\nDoesn't matter that New York and LA in Chicago and a few others have a different feeling that doesn't matter you're allowed to have that opinion but they don't get to reset a definition they don't get to read to find words redefined phrases they don't get to do that\nAnd I'm just about fed up with a sharp I'd present that as well we'll take phone calls on why
