I spent money on costumes\nI spent all this money on candy because I Want the kids they're full sized candy bars I Want them to have fun and it's a Wednesday night the kids got to go to school tomorrow and it's gonna rain\nYou know you put in all that effort to you spend all that money and what are you gonna have to show for it\nMaybe nothing\nLike I said my neighbor says that if it rains there won't be hardly a kid number one out here if it doesn't rain there'll be out here by the hundreds so\nWe'll see what we ended up with I'm trying to see if there's any more of these little fun Halloween facts I think I've learned more in the in researching uh the topic for today show I think I've learned more about Halloween than I ever thought you know I didn't I didn't even realize they didn't know I'm a Seventy two percent of parents\nAdmit to stealing their ... eighty five percent have a plan for helping their children enjoy candy in moderation\nDid your mom ever do that you did she like my mom didn't and I'm surprised 'cause my mom my mom had a lot of rules as it relates to that we have a caller out there and I did some words at renting a night in right now the other way\n[noise]\nReveling in like a yellow lab arena nights in a forty five or ... I just wanted to say I don't\nCare if that gets ... five years old if they get a good job still on their ... candy now if you're ten years old and you were in a constant you're not getting candy and it's all about because you\nYou got the costume rule that's interesting doesn't matter the age you just managed the costume so does he need to be does it have to be a homemade costume because those are the only ones that are really creative in good don't you think\nNo no it doesn't have to be made I mean I think it will come to the renaissance festival any awesome but you know they don't they don't make those at all okay All right\nUm so so what do you judge it cost him on that if it doesn't have to be home made it we can be store bought what do you judge it on\nYour ... your quality a\nLike [laughter] I think the last part where the scariest part [laughter] oh gosh that last night\nWe're on this program are privileged to have those of you who've chosen to listen listen and those have used to have chosen to watch watch\nI'm truly privileged it's an honor I Love every second of it\n\nWe've edited up and it wasn't even me it was talkers magazine before we added some of our biggest affiliates we have four million weekly listeners so now it's five or six million mhm we have um fifty million people have access to the program on Newsmax TV which is cool\nI got a total of that I edit them up and it's a lot this is generally speaking more than ... normally get like a total of twelve complaints yesterday about how I handled the call with the guy I think his name was William\nAnd and I wanted to address it because if there were twelve complaints than probably some others felt uncomfortable not the same time I got a ton and I I didn't have them up but a ton of people saying you're on fire way to go you demand you really you know you spell that are clearly he was being passive aggressive whatever\nI I just want to give a couple of helpful hits to those who are\nOf the belief that I somehow was meaner nasty or or a bad guy and again this is only really focused on a very small minority of those who watch or listen but there are a couple of like you disappointed me so bad you one guy said I had something else going on in my personal life that's why I acted like that\n... other than having to deal with this one every day hey and wedding Italian on on that you I didn't say anything about it and they mentioned your name didn't say a word in say anything he just said there is one of the fact that I come from then okay exactly right\nUm no my personal I was actually going just fine so I'm not really sure what you're talking about but let me address it get it out of the way\nAnd by the way and say I will take calls from people on the fourteenth amendment again today because I Am always ready to mix it up always\nIn fact when I have my my interview with a sheriff Clarke he and I disagree on the fourteenth amendment imagined that carry it wasn't even an argument it was a good lively debate right and\nWhen people call into the program there is no set time for when they should be out but I've actually had the people who make my call screener do me a favor and have the line start blinking a certain color when it gets to two minutes\nStudies have found study that I did right before the show and carry a did this study as well as the survey that we didn't yeah yeah but industry folks for years and years have said two minutes is way too long for a phone call move on to the next guy or move on to the next topic I'm giving you inside baseball you know really where else\nSo two minutes is about the max I gave the guy William yesterday about three times that yeah but only twelve seconds what do you have to say\nCame out that's not true\nSomebody calls the program they talk to the screener first that Sam my daughter um and they let her know here's what I Want to talk about I unlike other talk show hosts invite people who disagree with me to call the show\nI Want them to call the show because I think that if we actually have a lively conversation if not debate on an on an important issue no matter what it is could be abortion can be climate change can be the fourteenth amendment no matter what it is I think that we at least breathe life into the fact that there's more than one take\nThere's something you have to know about me and it's a it's a a reason why some of you listen I don't ... the present any voting on my show\nThat I haven't fully engulfed myself and knowledge of and what I mean by that is I really really really study not only my site I already know my son because they took the facts and then I and I dealt with it for my opinion from that but I also have to get the other side because the last thing you want to do is talk shows that somebody call in\nAnd have a varying opinion and you have no clue what he's talking about and you had no thought process they knew about that I Know what the argument is over the fourteenth amendment I get it\nAnd what's interesting is when people call in ... like you know the one guy either calling earlier this week Kerry who dropped the F bomb from New York and yeah we get his name but he called me a punk because\nWhen I said would you rather go to a convenience store where the employees are armed are the ones that can be used or the employees are not armed he said you're a punk I'd go to the one where they're armed and and then he dropped the bomb or something that's a stupid he was he wanted to go to the door to go Rob the the um the convenience store that had armed people are behind the counter which is the week I was just ...\nYeah it's okay I I even one needs to call in\nBut when you call in if you think you're going to say you are wrong and you've misinterpreted or you misunderstood the fourteenth amendment already you're starting on the grounding that suggest that I'm stupid\nAnd you're suggesting that you're not going to educate me now do I believe that there were some people that call in where I can get an education yes I think that I could learn from you know are there are people that I have on his gas that I have on his desk because I Want to learn from them absolutely almost every guest\nIf somebody who's exactly that description and learn from them but if you're going to call in and be passive aggressive and immediately say you're misunderstanding the fourteenth amendment you your misinterpreting it\nAnd then you go off at a change in\nFor a minute fifty\nBefore you said anything about what I'm wrong about I'm going to start jumping in\nAnd we're going to have a conversation now if you want somebody to call in and get three four five six minutes to give a dissertation about why he's writer she's right and you want me to shut up you've picked the wrong show I think NPR does that I think that CSPAN does that\nAnd color what's on your mind and go and then seven minutes later we'll take so much very interesting point that's not what we do here where we do here you know what I pictured carry I think that I value standard a few times a year when I picture when I'm doing\nA lively conversation like that maybe even a debate is the way the dinner table looked at my house growing up\nDoes that make sense okay it's only you know\nI come from a big family and when the entire family got together it was hundreds of us and you couldn't hear yourself more than two inches in front of your face for nine or ...\nEverybody was talking a shoveling food in and talking to some more in a guy says yeah but I think I read what are you talking to what do you think about it and it's just sort of how we can ... it was out of love those out of carrying it was a ... never angry\nOr William yesterday got angry because I wasn't going to hear his passive aggressive this tell me how wrong I was\nAnd then he started going to French law and international law and the whole bottom line for the fourteenth amendment and those who want to argue about it is ... is a small part that says the jurisdiction there up that that's what they are hung up on and I get that\nI completely understand the argument I completely understand Williams argument by the way what human I agree that we should not be given birthright citizenship to to the children of illegal aliens unfortunately the the constitution right know allows for it\nI think it should be changed I think it should be adjusted William thinks it covers it already and then he uses several examples couple of things that aren't gonna work on me\nWhen you call in or write to me afterwards and either assume some personal issue I might be having which is dumb um or you tell me that rush and Sean and mark and Glenn would never do that\nTerry have have we ever know discussions about how we're going to do the show here said well let's listen to rush in shining blend in and mark first and then we'll do it kind of along with what they said or done now never never\nAnd I don't expect that they would ever listen to my show and take talking points for me either but they're all great\nWere there you go to come\nTo got the cat is going on or not that I Can't see the rest of you and not asking to but you have a cat outfit on\nAnd then I had the chance to home yes and the west coast in their thinking appreciate any face paint today on camera that I'd\nProbably I probably would not have one of the yeah All right so you've got some kind of you know will you go ... a secondary topic 'cause I I Do like to lighten things up your fourteenth amendment ... and ... and again make sure you understand my stance on this before you call it in front of us are passive aggressive but I'm a ... will you trick or treat tonight\nNo unfortunately my little and thinks he's too old to be the first time that we don't ... what is the eleven eleven and he thinks he's too old I'm trying to talk of LA and I know and I try and get him on the phone will come out right now it's very bad and we still have\nAgain if you want to know if you want to see the happy and and a friendly cat\nA carry lucky it's J.

hers 'cause nobody even knows about her fan base and it's not just on by ... Joe talk show show talk show makes you stop by and\nSay hello there she is the ... All right now before I take some of these phone calls have you made clear on my stance using the fourteenth amendment because I'm William didn't get it and a lot of a lot of you wrote me didn't get it but I'm gonna make sure that you do get now understand I think it's perfectly cool that you disagree with me\nBut let me make sure that we understand each other before anybody call ... ... it's just stupid\nYou know what I mean I Know it's an I guess I'm going to argue NPR here within calling you pump gas and\nOil on it I mean the ... agreement outlined let's not pretend that it's not the case because I Am pompous about a ... a an arrogant and all that other ... and\nSo the bottom line is this the fourteenth amendment says what it says it says what it says ah it it's not about adding to it unless they're drafting from it I'm not pretending that it's something other than it is the fourteenth amendment says what it says I even said because I hate this term is what it is\nPersons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states in the state where they reside no state she'll make or enforce any law which celebration privileges blah blah blah so that the second part as a matter of the what's at odds here\nAnd what people are having a hard time understanding my take on is the first part where it talks about the jurisdiction there up\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states in the state where they reside that's clear to me it's clear English if you're born here\nAnd you're subject to the jurisdiction there of a person being born here would be subject to the jurisdiction their of their parents aren't so they've got to get there is to send back but the child certainly is subject to the jurisdiction there are there is no argument\nIn my opinion about that line now senator Howard that presented this and wrote about this in the Eighteen sixties\nWrites very clearly obviously we're not talking about foreign dignitaries or their families we're not talking about aliens we're not talking about and he goes down a list of ... obviously we're not talking about here is where I Believe they screwed up\nThey didn't put that in the amendment\nThe amendment says what it says\nPeriod end the story now I Know what the intent was Kennedy intent matter well not if you're a conservative and you look at this as the foundation\nThat this was in stone what liberals do is they say yes I see the first amendment but his living and breathing in its movable and his multiple with its like play though I disagree either get says when it says\nWell the second amendment is a little bowl and we can make all sorts of laws restrict or access to guns and infringe or access in southern because when the movable reasonable and that and it's play though I disagree I think it says what it\nSays I think that for all of the amendments so if it's poorly written fix it\nAnd it is poorly written they should not have left out the part that said obviously this does not include a team together word obviously this doesn't include foreign dignitaries this doesn't include um the children of illegal aliens they should have said\nThat had they said that\nThere wouldn't be an argument now what do I want I don't want there to be birthright citizenship I don't I Want birthright citizenship to not apply to people who are\nAnd I'm gonna let me tell you that if it gets to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals are going to be as clear as I can with you and I think you sound smart I think you're gonna agree with me if it gets to the Ninth Circuit court of appeals and if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court which still may\nThe Ninth Circuit court is going to say you don't have standing to bring this case they're not gonna interpret anything they're not gonna ruin even just going to throw it out and say he doesn't have standing you know that happens all the time\nWell it would be that child that would bring into the child would have standing inside the child in the new or it's going to bring his case right now nobody can bring this case because I Can't bring it to say eat you know somebody only legally\nYou bring a case I mean it's probably does the ... the executive order that's exactly\nThe ACLU would do it looked like we do it multiple do or you know everybody would line\nUp right right and and it would be thrown out because he doesn't have standing that is what I'm saying I don't know who wouldn't ...\nPresident for having made the move for having made ... they're going to bring the law suit against what he did and the court is going to say he had no right to do it you're correct what you're saying that these groups won't have standing\nNo no no no that's not withstanding it's standing at the right to bring a suit\nAnd so right now nobody would have standing to question is law if Trump than shoulder the interpretation which he has the right to executive branch is executed of these laws so he can direct agencies to not continue to allow citizenship or ... or any legal immigrants so like\nI I disagree wholeheartedly disagree wholeheartedly that he could do lose ... ... ... no no it is disagreeable because what I'm guessing you and I would agree that what Obama did with DACA was illegal\nYeah\nOkay it was illegal you but now you're telling me that Trump's can change the fourteenth amendment that wouldn't be illegal I'm here to tell you know he would be just as illegal as Obama was and it's as background I mean it goes back to my ... my my first point which was very simple we hate it when Obama did this why are we suggesting this guy do it\nI don't want him to do what I Want him to actually follow the process he's that were put in place by our founding fathers\nNot gonna Joel I'm form initially for a break on going to go and I gave you an eight minutes just to let you know eight minutes he's four times longer than most people would get I gave the guy yesterday six minutes which is three times longer than most people would get I get that you've got to feel as though I get what you feel as though I was rude to him or whatever\nBut what happened yesterday was they had a guy who called in was passive aggressive and decided to tell me how stupid I was and that was it we're going to go ahead and and and make it happen he got angry I put on hold whatever what you and I just the it is appropriate and I appreciate that we just did that doesn't make sense\nYes yeah I I agree with what how that calling yesterday\nWere allowed to its okay after this right\nYou know he was ... when you when you call it and say how you doing you misunderstand and your misinterpreting the law let me tell you as stupid you are now using the word stupid but let me tell you why and then he goes and talked about international law and never get to the point of where I was wrong that bothered me and then he got all mad and lost at school and that was it but again I wanted I Want to have\nLively conversations with people like you you're going to walk away from this thinking that you just one\nI'm going to walk a wealth feeling just as strongly as I felt before the phone call but at least I think we we were able to mix it up to where the listeners got something out of it and that's what I Want\nA great I broke we appreciate you in Kansas City grace she curious how you do it you have a conversation\nNice little dialogue going back and forth and nobody got now and then he kind of fat\nYou got it wrong in France here's where they do ... it's ... nine for one pack Joe packs dot coms narrator\n[noise] care of themselves\nGoogle heart radio [noise]\nHave you

to me\nWell you know I agree with you did I start off not going to be rude or anything like that they should be worried and the constitution or you know the way it should be worded is not to illegal immigrants it would've been easy to to include the\n... you know but take for instance you know a hypothetical situation or\nA mother and father traveling on a cruise ship in international waters right and they give birth in international waters is that child now a citizen of the world\nKnow or is known of it but it doesn't [laughter]\nWell I I Know it sounds leader but that is that's the reason it's a hypothetical but uh\nI think it's a great hypothetical and ... and I I don't know the law in this but I'm going to take a guess I'm I'm guessing that I'm right that child would be a citizen of the country it's parents are citizens up\nAnd it's a great question but here's but here's why it's different there is no jurisdiction out there\n... there you're not you're not a you know in some place that has I mean I guess you could say the voters the jurisdiction but not going to be a citizen of the boat so we know bad\nI mean could you make the case that that the child is is a citizen of where the boats port is maybe\nBut we're talking about actually being in the United states where there is a jurisdiction there are laws there there are mechanisms in place that if you're born here you're a citizen here it's a it's a great question but I think that it's an easy answer I think that that person would be a citizen of where the parents are from\nWell I Know that my children eight alone I mean not government not the state of the country they're much\nOh no I'm not going well jurisdiction doesn't but I don't think jurisdiction means more on\nA ... but you know as if you belong to your parents you know if your if your child belongs to a year and you're here say you're in Germany younger what you know when you gave birth there\nYour ... your child is still in American because they've built the child belongs to you if you if the parents falls under the jurisdiction right of the government then the property of ... the child would also fall under the jurisdiction of the country of origin of the parents\nWell Michael let me let me let me make this is the thing is they need to change it in the ... right in the words in plain black and white because of the folly of the founders words that they thought we ... we would retain commonsense oh no we last that long time ago take easily last yeah because I\nThink after the amendment was written the fourteenth amendment it was over a hundred years before it was used in this way that the child born here as an American citizen\nOh no no I don't think it was ... years no I I don't know I I don't think it was a hundred years there'll be amendment was added meeting sixty eight\nAnd I think Eighteen nineties uh it was used in this way I think that was the one case I think that's the case that we're talking about having said that I really do like the example of Germany I'm going to give you very simply for that you already know you already know the answer to this because you continued and talked about the fourteenth amendment Germany doesn't have birthright citizenship\nGermany France diner England does ... we we were smart enough to get rid of slavery smart enough to say all slaves all people born here are citizens of year that was great we forgot to put the part about no foreign dignitaries no illegals and so on we screwed up\nIn the Eighteen sixties they screwed up and I just wanted to fix it\nAnd the folly was our founders thought we would hold on to our\nCommon sense and you're right wing it in their heads and not our hearts yep\nA hundred percent ride my main great call see that's a great phone call\nHe completely set it exactly right and maybe because his voice was soothing and had nice Texas drawl maybe it's easier to tech I bet nobody will treat me now and say see that guy was a jerk\nAnd he completely agrees with me that's the weird part it's eight eight nine for one pack Joe ... dot com when we come back more phone calls I don't want to know when you think the cut off date or ages for Halloween a trick or treating bottom of this hour it's going to be sure of David Clarke we talk about Kanye West we talk about blacks if we talk about his new website\nWe also talk about this the fourteenth amendment ... know Carrie\nA friend of mine but he and I do not agree and I mean among the ice skating rink and art eighty nine for one pack Joe ...

A. G. S. for one hundred twenty five dollars off your mattress order helix sleep dot com slash bags\nWell because of the diet or because of the demographics of the United states right now most of the huge population that is retiring and the younger generation last already you know there's been a couple of wars and you know they got involved in that that has affected us\nSo what I'm seeing is because compared to other countries are population the young population is not on that level or the other populations are worried are now I Know I'm all for the fact that these should protect the United states\nFrom illegal broad healing activities like if somebody comes in and have a baby and then they're just trying to use that that's\nWrong with that I I I Love your like a brother or going to run a matter of time but I'm not really sure I understand the question are population continues to grow I think we're okay journal blurred when we come back to the writer\n[noise] both of them\nAre North Carolina State University professor is under fire for providing students with a handout that told them to block Fox News from family members\nAnd that also accused my network of spreading bigotry and hatred you can read the document for yourself at ... dot com the professor also urged white students to stop calling the police on minorities suggesting they have implicit bias in other words if you see something suspicious don't say anything at all just keep putting yourself this is what ...\nGoing to say something where\nCNN going to be forced to do something and I'm not going to take them off you're totally right we're going to end by the color and so and and you're going to happen to a real some of this stuff back and you're getting crazy out there he says don't ... yeah it is out there calling other people racist but you know CNN is okay they're they're raised on\nA but you know nobody else can have a ... otherwise they're racist\nThat's a great point a few women opposing viewpoint on any other network on my network on Fox anywhere um are you are racist according to them but they are actively employing people who will say things like white men are the biggest terrorist threat I mean when you say that you are you are actually taking a race of people\nAnd you're denigrating them to the point that it is racism and not only does he get away with it you know in a couple of months he's going to be drunk on television on on New Year's eve again this is this guy is it's weird\nSure you remember back during this late they one of the things that the Democrats pedal\nIs that a black males were a threat to white women you know that's what that sounds like it's very ... very distasteful and be like somebody today in modern times saying black man or the cause of violence in America you know some sweeping statement like that yeah\nAnd you get in big trouble or you're taking off the air is edited used at a job he's taken off the or at least these sanctions absolutely somebody again and you know a ... you guys get to do with the humidity but you know as I say listen to it let them do it because eventually it's going to step in\nThe new website is up and it looks amazing America's share of dot com America's sheriff dot com go there and check it out beautiful design it's the appropriate name by the way for the website you are and Erica Scharf in my opinion and you go there and by dear read his articles and by all means follow him on Twitter at a ... is it ... and I've been a clerk what is it\nAs a clerk clerk with any yeah you know I'm the only one website everything is there you can click on Twitter on wait wait show up ... or ... you go to a website and you don't have to worry about all this other stuff to handle whatever it is it's all the website\nI just go to the website American sheriff dot com also get his book\nTop under fire it's an amazing read go and get that as well\nUm ... you're right I Would first of all I don't I don't believe it so I wouldn't say because of that but if I said something like a black men are the cause of violent crime in America that would be a ridiculous thing to say and and my contract actually says because of the the morals clause we're bringing a bad light to our our network I Would be gone but but they trust that I Would never say something so stupid Don Lemon says something stupid\nAnd he supported for it and and it spread around as if somehow gospel\nDidn't the president just um pardon Joe Johnson\n'em knowing it was it was it Jack johnson who was the boxer from the turn of the century\nOr the other was a it was Jack johnson Johnson yeah one of the fire\nRight so he was he was stripped of his title and he was excommunicated from society because he dared date white women that was the problem that's why he was charged with a crime and convicted of crimes so the idea that a hundred years later Don let me can say the exact opposite and get away with a B B applauded by the left makes me sick\nBut I heard a number of a share of that I think is is showing that that done lemons and the vast minority subtly this president has a forty percent approval rating when black folks what do you think of that\nYeah well you know people can see some of this nonsense I mean think about that order was sharply the crime for transporting a white woman across state lines and moreover right you know that for this country came from and and the guy like on them and returns us back to those things and you just flip the switch we're not saying that about black people but now\nCertain black people you notice I didn't say all black or or singing about white people no place in our lexicon for that sort of stuff I doubt that Don Lemon has a morals clause because uh CNN doesn't have any morals
