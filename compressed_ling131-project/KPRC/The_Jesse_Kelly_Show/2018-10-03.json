it they're great company fully insured\nThey started right here in Houston I'm their family owned and operated and they've just continually expanded this people found out just how good they are\nHere's the number one eight to two oh five six one and here's the other thing I found they they really work well in working you into a schedule that works well for you or the day when you can be home to let them in the late one eight to do zero five six one\nThat's still a one eight to ... to zero five six wants all the people that worked for ... and we'll clean your carpet they worked for who they are not contractors subcontractors they\nAll work groups by ... steam O O P s steam dot com that's looks steam dot Gov heart for fifty one now one of the things we're working on was are a little list your I Love make a list of um\nUh in seeing how many things that we can kind of agree on it if you want to add something at the list by all means do so seven month three two one two five nine fifty seven month three to five nine fifty the list is of things that we would know would definitely disqualifies somebody or we feel would definitely disqualify you for higher office\nOr maybe for any political office\nI don't know that we need to put um other than qualifications as far as skill sets\nI don't need that we know that we need to make any changes on personal life habits or bad habits or sins or whatever whatever you want to call them\nUm based on whether you're running\nFor a judge or if you're running for\nPresident of the United states I think maybe we should consider the same rules should apply there should be some universal things we could probably all agree on a murder was one thing if you're convicted if you're if you're a serial killer then it got ... you probably don't have time\nTo run for higher office you're too busy you know scouting out your next victim\nEmbezzlement or because I certainly don't want somebody controlling a taxpayer dollars who has a history of stealing money\nAlthough\nNow that I think about it it it kind of feels like what I pay my taxes it kinda feels like that's what's going on all the time now is that they're\nStealing my money because they're they're\nThey're taking it without me saying okay you can you can have this much go ahead and take it they just they just they they just\nYour body is take your money they get out of your paycheck or they take it out at the register a they take it out when you make your house payment the property taxes and uh and they they let us vote on a few things about how they're gonna spend the money but for the most part you know they just spend the money on what they deem is the appropriate thing to spend the money on\nSo sometimes it feels a little bit like they're stealing my money\nSo embezzlement um murder those who are on there\nSure what else what else do you go on the list a teenage drinking\nIllegal activity ...\nBecause the ... if you throw in illegal activity of any kind man that's a long list and you'd never be able to find somebody a traffic violation no of course not\nYou know so what if you were speeding what if you had a DWI either or DUI depending how do you want to call driving under the influence driving while intoxicated what have you had that if you had that on your record should that disqualify you if that's the case ... to work these drop out\nBecause he has one and I'm sure there are plenty of other politicians who do to\nThere's a certain amount of things that we do in life that have to be for for given that have to be chalked up as a life lesson just little bump on the road to maturity\nThere's certain things in life that are like that and then there are certain things that are more unforgettable things that you know are much\nMore of a a character judgment on somebody now if you want to make a judgment on a broad Kavanaugh because he drank in high school\nI guess you could do that I I Try real hard not to judge other people I'm not I'm not saying I'm a perfect at it far from it\nUm you know I made my own fair share of mistakes in life as we all have I Am so far from being a perfect person they'd even funny and that is true of most of us but I Would like to think that I have\nLearned a lot of lessons in life as a result of what are those people you know not to get overly spiritual you here but I Wonder if those people who believes that we're here for a reason and we're here to learn lessons\nAnd I'm not I'm not always sure I Know what less than it is I'm supposed to learn maybe I had a whole bunch to learn maybe uh maybe what's\nHappening to Brett Kavanaugh is another life lesson or biggest things don't always go smoothly things don't always go well they just they just don't life is like that like there was a lot of ...\nAnd I and I can't help but think that you know it's good that it does because there's not much fun when you're going through it and what's happening to Brett Kavanaugh is is horrific and it shouldn't be happening\nBut he strikes me is the kind of person who will come out on the other side a stronger person for it and his marriage may end up one or two things will happen with him and his family something like this either makes\nYou stronger or its gills things um\nThere's sometimes in relationships don't survive things like this because it's the stress is just so much\nThat everybody turns on each other but I don't get the impression that he's that kind of person you know I certainly know get the impression that his wife is that kind of person so I'm being a a betting man upon occasion my\nMoney would be on him and his family becoming stronger people as a result of all this and I still think it's going to end up okay for him\nNobody thought it would end up okay for Clarence Thomas after the whole the need to heal thing and people still bring it up from time to time\nBut I don't think it's a daily drain on his life and I don't think it really in the grand scheme of things it's not the top thing that people think of when it comes to Clarence Thomas or will remember him for even though it was a huge part\nOf his life and getting confirmed that the U.S Supreme Court I think it will be the same thing for Brett Kavanaugh\nWill linger for awhile mainly because he's a Trump choice and anything they can do deterred I'm President Trump they're going to do but I think at the end of the day you'll end up being judged for what kind of a Supreme Court\nJustice he ends up being and I still think he will be our next Supreme Court justice\nI don't know

crap about\nThey don't have the right temperament to be president or they don't have the right temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nWhat do you think what do you think\nThe left would have said how do you walked out and said hey listen I realize you're calling me a serial rapist and you say raped a bunch of women and rape rape and raping rape and uh yeah I'm just like this letter from the

oh gee what a year off your horse usually contributed to the Washington Examiner and we've had drunk several times but you know how are you\nI'm doing very well thanks for having me on\nMy man you should have told me I was supposed to suit up today I didn't know is going to suit up and had a great background but why did he was wonderful I listen I always appreciate the time\nAnd and the knowledge you you just for those who hadn't seen you before on my show are from Russia originally your now an American citizen God Bless you and welcome aboard brother um but you've got great insight into what's happening in that country\nWhere most of us don't have it here so I Want to start where you'd even no one's going to start\nYour twenty twelve in the election I'm Mitt Romney said the biggest threat to our way of life was Russia Obama left them off the stage the left left them off the stage but he's really onto something was\nHe was and it's very unfortunate the liberals criticized him at the time of course now that have been proven completely wrong right and I think President Trump is doing it very fantastic job and handled in Russia\nOr even though he's keeping lines of communications open he saying All right Mr President I Will negotiate with you if you want to negotiate with me but it has to be an America First approach you you said I Want to make America great again I'm not going to come a compromise on that point and of course he has not been a lot firmer lot stronger with Russia or than his predecessor bronco bomb\nWhich interesting use the left and it appears to these text messages and hopefully we get the release of the fires orange stuff we'll find out even more but it appears to do their their whole game plan was let's pretend he somehow has\nHas been colluding with Russia to win the election which makes no sense again you're twenty twelve Russia wasn't a threat at all your twenty sixteen big completely changed our election um\nVisitors always been the way of the left in this country is to make Russia Boogie Man when necessary and not when necessary how was that received\nIn in the former Soviet Union how ... how does food and how does who's who's government received the fact that he's either the good guy or the bad guy depending on what big are these rich he always a good or bad guy you\nMm [noise] oh that's a fantastic question I think the distinction\nA it's a bit of ... when it comes to domestic us politics I don't think the Russian general public understands a necessarily the type of\nA liberal talking points that change and adapt over time\nBut it but it certainly is a a good observation I Would say this though a lot of reporting the said repeatedly that he pretty much knows what ah every us administration is going to do so I don't think putting himself the surprised by this matter\nA but American voters have to realize the fact\nThat liberals or don't really care about geopolitics one they make Russia to be a boogie man they simply want you know the domestic talking points to want to undermine President Trump's great election victory right and it seems like they don't really care at all about whether or not Russia or actually have then once and has gaining a innocent once all over the world\nI think you're right about those but you know a lot of ear off our friend and of course contributed to the Washington Examiner when we look at what's happening now Russia has has begun to missile system delivery to Syria\nWith the Syrians deliver the missiles ... shield for Russia's fringe Syria almost the same sort of way we had a shielded Eastern Europe that that President Bush put up with putting up and then bronco Bob Said we're not going to do that because for some reason we didn't want to protect our friends what is this this missile delivery system that they're that they're bringing\nA very interesting it's called the s a three hundred it is a surface to air\nMissile system it as a defensive missile system\nAnd the whole thing create really raises a number of questions because Russia all of a sudden had all of these missile systems ready to go you know lined up they delivered them very very quickly\nUm so all of a sudden you ask the question whether or not these missile systems or an operation or where they were simply prepared and I had everything in motion in order to deliver them to Syria\nOr but there are two lines of thought when it comes to Syria and when it comes to what Russia tries to do in Syria some experts believe that uh Russia doesn't really need Syria at all and in Syria is just sort of this this prop to keep the United states distracted ride joined other geopolitical aspirations of Latimer putting\nThe other line of thought other experts believe that it's the other way around that she was actually very important for them or putting because for years has been trying to build Russia's influence in the middle east of course the United states and the fantastic ally in the middle east Israel very powerful have and you got weapons so you'd have to try to offset that\nSomehow and I think this really shows us a long term strategy for Latimer puente is now giving the as three hundred system by the way it's called the newest one Russians have the U.S four hundred which is more than ... so he they're not giving them the new stores\nUh but nevertheless they want to say hey here you go here's this missile system um and hopefully what I'm recording thinks this is going to bring Syria's some stability so that's his game plan\nNikita would this missile system be an anti Tomahawk missile system because the president or president drops fifty some odd Tomahawk missiles on Syria when Syria was using chemical weapons against their own people would stop those missiles to resist any anti Israel missile system do we know\nAbsolutely thanks for having now and again\nThe key to Vladimir off you use the

twenty eight or so judges on the United states circuit court of course justice Gorsuch and [noise]\nAnd perhaps soon followed by justice cabin on\nIts Kellyanne Conway a counselor to the president I got to tell you you know and by the way she was also the woman that the president says was really the reason why you want to win the election and I agree with that when\nWe talk about cabinet or they couldn't make anything stick to be brought them early on as he said they couldn't get him on the merits now let's go back and find out who he you know it might have started the auto of\nBack when he was fourteen but now the guy drew a piece of advice allegedly somebody at a bar after you'd be forty countered with his wife states bizarro world they really have nothing against the guy we have no way to stop the guy sold as mulatto sitting behind him and you've got a far left wing resist lawyer that's that's helping out you know some of these witnesses mean when you step back\nJust for a second and take a look at it\nThey weren't going to be okay with anybody where they\nAre they're not they're also not going to those who have said that they oppose anybody that Donald Trump nominate joy Supreme Court are certainly not going to find their way to supporting\nJudge Kavanaugh after the FBI investigation they demanded to happen certainly not after the testimony they demanded to happen and so they should just be honest about what this says this is about the strike destroying a man's life because he he\nWas nominated by Donald Trump this is about the laying and keeping that seat open pass in terms of not three twenty twenty and Americans had it Americans are smart and they're watching this process people\nAre disgusted by the process Christine Blasey Ford has Dianne Feinstein a Democrat due to blame that she is now a household name a recognizable everywhere because they're the ones who smoked out her identity she asked to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelfth our had told\nAnd but for the Republicans\nFord may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's the Senate Sherry committee and the majority of the other Republicans they gave her that I bet you're right they're talking about ice in the air this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process you folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed fix\nThat hangs on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll\nSee what happens but if you're if you're a few of those red state Democrats Joe pads you're really nervous today because you're caught between ... on one hand your Democratic Party drifting so far to the left towards socialism and toward destruction and resistance and obstruction and delay and and and stop sign as a symbol of your party\nAnd you're stuck between that and the will of your own people right because West Virginians\nAnd and ... and who is in Indiana and certainly people in North Dakota announced read they want judge Kavanaugh confirmed and they want their senators to do their jobs advising contending and voting for him\nIt's a ... or the president Kellyanne Conway till you do you think that there should be an ethics committee I'm a ... investigation into Feinstein or whoever\nOn her staff leak that out she said on this for two months she could have talked to have it all better directly when they met privately she could have brought it to the president as soon as she got the letter you're right she sat on her because she hoped that they would be them down on the merits they couldn't the guy is supremely\nQualified to be in this job these are going to be investigations should there be\nWell I saw some never say that they were going to investigate it I saw Senator Tom cotton last week and say that very thing that they should investigate the leak of the other letter and the other thing that's happening as Senator Hatch made reference I Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the\nOdd consequences that could follow to forge lawyers who either\nNeglected to mention to her which was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California but I'm having a kind of washing either for lied under oath that she\nYou know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and then fill or if they had to tell if you go there are no cameras and create lights and tried to cast in California there's no Washington based\nObsessive media right tick tick tick on uncover every jot until and the new client base for them afterward ferret that there are many things that could be investigated long after the vote for the confirmation happens\nIs the confirmation going to happen to you your your bed is he's going to get confirmed Lindsey Graham says if he's not re nominate him\nYes I did see that so many McConnell said he's ... he's going to have a vote and this man will be voted on people that ... percent oppose him\nBut had the guts to say why don't pretend it's about X Y and Z you when you add already said you're going to oppose any of Donald Trump's nominees from the beginning anything I wanted to mention for all the talk about how energized\nThe liberals are and they're watching in suburban women I suburban women are smart enough to know that they are benefiting from an incredibly of economic boom market\nThat didn't happen by Clinton could happen to causation his name is Donald Trump even we haven't found one Democrat now who is trying to apply the ... his name is ... bomb that President Obama is trying to take credit for it says he didn't get the talking points as Democrats but to say but the economy is not that great he\nThing it's so great I'm taking credit for it but the suburban women also should look at this process and they should say I'm\nSo much is going right but I also I also found so disgusted that\nPeople um hurt this woman used it in line for their own political grandstanding purpose isn't the case of a few of them up and the Senate Judiciary committee to actually raise money for their twenty twenty elections they injected politics and what should be a decidedly non political\nProcess here and yes I think it will be investigated after the fact and and I think that people will be very upset about this for a long time to kind of folks are watching and for all the talk about liberal excitement look at their ratings have the Fox news primetime lineup last Thursday after the testimony over five million per show that people say that\nThe the um the daytime shows the morning shows for the networks want to you had us over three hundred thousand lakes\nAnd the ... to the president's tweet about Brett Kavanaugh just twenty four hours later\nThat's a very high number of like for a presidential tree so people are energized they're watching not voters have their say don't\nLet let this one slip through don't given to to the mob mentality of of the minority in the Senate I who doesn't have enough votes to stop this man\nI I Know I Know you're going to go one last quick when would that have been refreshing Kilian had anybody on the on the left on that panel the Judiciary Committee been questioned by somebody in the media one simple question if he comes back squeaky clean from the FBI investigation you wanted will you vote for him when he was only when I watch and\nAnd I haven't taken that question hypothetically if you're a great question right on and remember when I say something else so Ford and Kavanaugh under oath but none of the senators who are they just ask and say whatever the heck they want 'em but you're right what would change because they never thought like they never thought that uh that\nThey said it just shaking many would give for an opportunity to testify they did in fact they accommodated bent over backwards to accommodate her\nHer laundry list of demands I she testified ten days after she was eleven days after everybody found out who she is and that would be eleven days after Brett Kavanaugh was willing to testify and then one number two\nAnd then they say well we happen to the FBI investigation they would only take four days between now and the day that they have to find so let's just do it they never thought the president would go ahead and I'll tell you that he authorized and saying well maybe it should be longer a stronger deeper I'd not enough it'll never be enough for folks\nWho aren't dealing honestly with ... with with why they oppose this man and his nomination to the United States Supreme court the you're right how many they won't change their mind\nMaybe done but we're looking at some of those red state Democrats who need to exceed the will of their voters do right by the people who put them on the job or decide that they're going to be complicit in the process to try to destroy if you live in and and and the way\nMove and then there was this very specious allegation about why he lied under oath you committed perjury and then that was completely blown out of the water because I guess NBC News reporting on this did not report everything that was said\nBecause he does in fact say that what happened happened or that he knew about something that was happening um and it was reported as if he said he didn't know\nWhich wasn't true so the whole thing stinks just due to vote already Jeff Flake is out soon and if he is going to be a lobbyist as Michael Malice from saying the other day if he was going to be a lobbyist he's not going to get a whole lot of help from people on the right I'm In that he's trying to stop this\nUm this nomination from happening it's very strange to me I think you will at least see McCaskill and probably um\nOh who's the guy in West Virginia mention you're probably will see them\nUm go for Kavanaugh as well so it probably will be fifty two so do you want to do maybe even fifty three depending on what Collins and Murkowski in these in these others do there really isn't anything else they can drop now but would be relevant to stop this vote from happening\nBut I Do wish that somebody would ask the question and I think it's a good journalistic question\nHave senator Booker grow because hey senator Coons have senator Harris hey senator ... will\nYou vote yes two confirmed this guy if the investigation shows nothing new\nBut nobody asked that question I think that that's a valid question because of all live in Salem and welcome to are going to be lying to actually barber wants to talk about Minnesota politics the barbecue old on 'til after we have dug ward low he'll be at the bottom of the hour this way we can\nTalk to in context to that uh that it it's a race for attorney general in that state that the entire nation if not the world is watching between Keith Ellison and Douglas we'll have more information as we do that let me go to a is it a go ahead\nI was getting into that you mentioned senator Cory Booker didn't hear what he said\nYeah and I don't know but but somebody said he was on who's really do\nWell that book or his head and this is from Fox News and the ongoing FBI probing the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh he suggested this than it needs to quote move on to another Supreme Court nominee whether Kavanaugh as innocent or guilty\nShe I mean when you're when you live your life through such a scope of Ashley Wagner Murray\nAs as grow because does when you live your life through the lack of rationale maybe we should move on from him being a senator because he admitted the groping somebody when he was sifting maybe we should do that ... ... is that carry I don't care what side of the aisle you're on can his sentence that he just made me just reported cannot make sense to anybody\nWell now and it goes back to what you were talking about because now he's saying his credibility Kavanaugh's credibility is being challenged and his temperament has been revealed a at last week's hearings and whether he's guilty or innocent he really shouldn't be on the Supreme Court\nMakes no sense All right the neighbor's dog on line six dog what's going on\n\nIs your name dog it's just the old geezer Doug what's your name I Know you can hear me because I'm looking at Minnesota been on hold for about an hour last chance and get out of your\nI let you go back to it and say hello and welcome to a shame in Fort Worth ... what's going on\n[noise] hey how you doing Joe living the dream Shea what's happening\nI Am a first time caller so they never really called into show before but I have a son I wanted to ask you about that at all\nI Am one of these people out here is a as totally support Kavanaugh and I'm frustrated that based upon what you were just saying about songs are saying let's get a hat ready to handle that and somebody else yeah\nThat's kind of a similar thing that I was going to throw asked you to monitor and about and it wouldn't be completely at all fair to Kavanaugh but I don't understand the timing of all this\nI think that he should go through that when you're talking about these three centers that my vote against and we're talking about a Democrat overhear something something in the Math Doesn't add up\nI I don't know how much time we have to the next election\nSo my mind I was sitting there wondering not that you can trust any do you make with a Democrat but if the debt was elect Kavanaugh go by the wayside\nAnd Trump pick any Bartlett for example is her name\nAmy Barrett yeah beret come up I don't know\nIf you can totally skipped the judicial process of the Senate committee and all that kind of stuff to just say okay we're going to get rid of him then he gets to name her and she goes through and we don't even have all this dog and pony show going on about it\nWell she didn't even know why should I gotta run 'cause I'm right up against it but uh it'd be interesting question ... ... and I think that there could be a recess appointment but I don't want the president to make that kind of deal not even for a second I don't want the president\nTo make that kind of deal I Want him to stick to his guns this is the right guy he's extremely qualified there's no reason to disqualify him no reason to move on\nIt's that simple so why move on Doug award load the Republican running for attorney general of of Minnesota when we come back on the Joe ... jokes there they had yeah\nWatching Doug did you have any clue but it was going to be like this when you when you decided to the pro your name in the ring\nNo I did not know that was about Eighteen months ago and things that have developed quite a bit is the end of there's a lot of tension there than other race right now a chance to retire hills in for politics and Minnesota and that'd be great for the whole country\nWell what's interesting is we have this cabinet stuff going on uncorroborated or um allegations when when they've been investigated nothing has come up with them yet the left says he's guilty he's a serial rapist he's a bad guy he hates women he's beside you and so on and so forth and there's zero prove with Keith Keith Ellison\nYou actually have documented nine one one calls we have women who are showing pictures that that were taken when they went to the doctor because they said that Keith Ellison abused them I mean there's a lot of hypocrisy is they're not\nNo credible obviously it just demonstrates that Democrat direct our bosses they care all of our in politics they don't care about women they don't care about truth I don't care for the one hand they're going after ... am and all they do that you should be in front of the Supreme Court orders over operation of the ... record by a doctor for\n... and the other hand you've got ... ... the deputy sheriff Democrat that took me to be the top law enforcement official in the state of Minnesota and two women have come or made allegations of domestic violence against him and these are credible allegations that are corroborating encouraged by documentary ... by\n... medical records shortly after the time the abuse which has led to er into the sixteenth or talking about a very recent\nEntire as well and those records include reports from the doctors were Karen Monaghan ... used to or doctors in the doctor's notes on the news and the effects of these ... and we had him on his son\nAustin who can't for the allegations initially he has seen a videotape of some of the views and it actually is on his mother's corroborating evidence we have substantiated allegations ... Democrats are looking the other way\nWell after he got the nomination for ... for the Democrat side for the AG job I'm a ... D and she said they're going to investigate but from what I understand from you ... and other sources the investigation is being done by somebody who's a sponsor of him or the sponsor of the DNC who who did the investigation that said it's inconclusive\nRight well investigation and Mexican or just came out a within the last couple of days and they concluded not surprisingly that allegations are an substantiated Shannon ... and it was conducted by a legal partner of the Democratic state parties a principal\nAttorney wondering about ... ... ... ... you know a law firm ...\nDonated over five hundred thousand dollars or five hundred thousand dollars to a Democrat candidate\nSo they literally they literally have a a a a\nVested interest in him not being guilty of course he's the guy for that party it is Doug ward lo Dee oh you gee W. A. R. D. L. O. W. A. G. dot com go there he's the Republican nominee for attorney general the top law enforcement job you said that very well and that's important to really reiterate the top law\nEnforcement job could go to a guy\nNamed Keith Ellison who is alleged to have done this not to one woman but to to more than one or ... what's going to do to the divorce records why do why does the news media wants to want to see who's divorced records what did they say is in there to you know\nDon't know what they never they are still that's unusual so they need\nThe ... the public can understand what's in there\nBut what's interesting is when President Trump was running for president everybody wanted to talk to 'em Yvonne from his former wife um and they wanted to see the the the records of their divorce and everything and anything he's ever done was supposedly fair game and the attacks continue on him with ... said he's being shielded why\nIs ... ... Democrats ... only about our ... and that's all this is demonstrate for the entire country a very political negatively political a Democratic Party bosses are\nIt Keith almost thought that he would be the chairman of the DNC he was actually is that when Tom press one and and now he's the the vice chair as you said this is one he's one of the faces of a party\nUm and he faces these allegations and you said this very well known repeated these are recent allegations I mean as recently as August", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jesse Kelly Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
