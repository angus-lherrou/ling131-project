response to the dismissal of her defamation last Oh yes it does he have to keep it above board when it comes to to Stephanie Clifford\nAgain I mean it's not like they're the moral side or something that the Evan Audi equip words here it's not like that's going on I mean what's actually happening is it it appears to be he's just fighting back but isn't it the same woman who's willing to describe his junk and again I Can't call a junkin I Am I allowed to call the junk or not\nYeah I'd say now ... like that word\nSo this is this is the same guy or the same woman who went on with a was an interesting Cooper\nAnd she looked like you know there's something going on with her her eyes were so dilated there were so huge they later said she was a cold medication or something which I'm not so sure that we do that to your eyeballs this is the woman it still needs to be a CD nightclubs and and she's dancing using his name and his fame to get people to go there\nAnd ... he keeps on showing up on these cable news channels talking about how we might run for president or something\nSo I mean for me it just I don't understand why it's a problem and he named calls her back\nI mean ... he's been calling him every name in the book since day one but really if you want to kill it back further than that the media has been called a game every name in the book since day one every name of the book\nAnd then they called him everything from Cheetos to to fake bank to I'm from ... or drop whatever the hell are calling instead of Trump calling him a a a woman abuse or a sexual assault or they call this guy everything he calls her horse face and which by by the way I don't think she's got a horse race\nOr the interfaces reasonably attractive\nI don't have the rest of the boroughs you're saying or face the reason I don't see a ... do you see ...\nI did not and\nSo but I mean is he allowed to be a child and fight back I guess I mean not like he's going to stop because we used to say so

I Love your energy I Love her energy going into the mid term we're very very close to it um it looked like it was going to be a blue wave what you're getting\nTo me sounds like retarded Goldman for some real blue wave some stupid but now we're starting to look like the red or the conservatives or the American traditional values people are so mad about Kavanaugh so mad about the ... the economy that big might just go out and vote how you feel the golden here\nIf you if you think it's a ... ... if you look at a rally or trumped up you know these are not people that would come out for you know John McCain burgers or rally or a male nominee rally\nThis is a whole different swap the American occupation that loves Donald Trump because he's one of those guys that are fighting for you in the country one rally in those orders to make sure they know he's actually on the ballot this fall because if we lose Democrats are going to go after them reach them in ... that number one number two\nWe didn't like in Wisconsin and I think across the country\nOr what Democrats for doing the judge John I'm In fact that you have allegations that aren't substantiated they want a conviction without any proof of people don't like to be on that show what I've seen is\nPeople's personally my part of the country or the central rural Wisconsin yeah they don't like ah they don't want the protests there like you know what you're paying down the doors of the Supreme Court you're you know you're running after\nAll senators you know in the you know in the capital I'm less ... less all let's blow up a lung chase each other down and behave so poorly\nThey hate that and because the left is behaving so poorly in the swing area that we're in I think this rural part that might have swung Democrat is not kicking back our way\nWhich gives us a great opportunity to win not just keep the house to pick up seats in the Senate\nBut I Would agree with you and it's interesting the president is on the ballot ... this bold and two weeks the next month this mid term um because of the house does go to the left suddenly he can do we want it to do and we started impeachment process to use which\nThey don't make any sense any way the Senate will do anything with them anyway but it's a way to to sort of feed the animal vet who's the media um you're right though I mean I hadn't heard and explain what God before people like this didn't show up for McCain and for Romney they're showing up their their their driving hundreds if not thousands of miles to go impact these arenas and have been tons\nOf thousands of people outside as well there really are energized who's the media just ignoring it or or is it something that\nWell I guess they probably are too dumb question would I be ignoring it or or do they hate it when they see it so so they're just not reporting it as much\nI I don't think they I think this is a a recent phenomena several weeks they don't see that saw ship that it's happening and by the way the media stock you know in New York ... in California so middle America has a huge thing in in how we rule in DC\nThey're not part of it and so there you know they want to talk about stormy\nDaniels and the president's tweeting ones are Russia and you want to talk about cabinet line you know allegations and thirty six years ago yeah they're not seeing going on and real American by the way the policies that you know you know we implement which we talk with all the time till we believe in limited government conservatism which is you know limit rules regulations lower taxes strong\nIt works and our people aren't going back to work with better wages rural America loves that and Democrats what's the alternative alternative I Want to protest I Want to burn American flags and want to people who disagree with me but if you saw how do you make my life better\nThey have zero ideas and you know they used to be the party of JFK who said ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country remembering oh yeah they don't talk that or um ...\nThere to lower taxes and and a strong military this Democrat Party is a bunch of left wing radical socialist who have nothing to do with the Democrat Party of oh\nWhy their lives and um you know blue collar Americans to put their butts in everyday go to work and build this country and make a great\nI could not agree with you more aid Sean Duffy district several Republican rates in Wisconsin or the midterms are coming up I think you're right you're right about the the left today the message really use let's let's talk about abolishing ice let's open the borders let's give away everything we can and trade let's let's impeach the president impeached justice Kavanaugh\nBut because

O. mhm but I understand ... what\nWas going to say but as president of the United states the ... old I mean the ... thing you know when\nWe go into they got you know lower were you in the lower I mean you know he doesn't know bronco\nNo I mean are you going to the low blow yeah and and it's it's an interesting angle because that's the ... the legacy media my calling you the far left already been wiped out with a legacy media\nTries to get him back in line by saying what is the price on presidential I just wish like I was talking with a former basketball player who I think is a great guy I consider him a casual friend I mean I don't think you called me a friendly knows me and I know him and um we're just having a conversation and he\nAfter talking about the president for a bit he said to me I just want him to be presidential\nMhm and I got to be honest I I don't I mean I Know what he meant but I don't know what he means and here's what I mean\nPresident Trump is who people hold up on our President Obama I should say is who people hold up on high as how to be presidential\nYou've heard that right yeah we carried himself how he greeted the world and the people loved him and they found over him and what an amazing president said he's like a rock star\nAnd and this guy is like a bull in a China shop\nAnd then I think that President Trump would actually appreciate me saying that he's like a bowling a China shop but he doesn't he doesn't mind\nNow I can also say wow was presidential as Obama was he also sucked does a president and I can go down the list about all the things that I disagreed with him but I think were bad for our freedoms our liberties are our country our standing in the world I Would have a list of what I think he did wrong\nSo\nWith a gun to my head you ask me do I want somebody who appears presidential and sucks of the job\nOr somebody who doesn't care if he knocks over your your favorite vase which would suck I don't like that but\nDoes it vary knocks it over as long as he's on the way to go you know bring riches and more freedoms are more liberties and more tax freedom and better trade deals I'll take the second guy does that make any sense it does it does I'm sure a lot of people from that same line\nIt and yes he comes off as as somebody who is rough around the edges and and sometimes\nKindergarten like what the name calling but I think that he also does it for a purpose\nThat is what does he have trend in the past two days he's got Pocahontas and horse race trend in the past two days as he makes yet another great deal portrayed as he makes another great or he goes any tourists the storm ravaged areas and and does for the people that are what he can and his capacity\nBut I think that he purposely send people off and his wild goose chases and the legacy media is dumb enough to jump on it and say horse drags out there you know but those who don't know what we're talking about he referred to Stephanie Clifford still read angels as horse race\nAnd and what did he say her third rate lawyer and ... them\nSo you you know and and I did I asked his son I said Arabic we have to talk about horse race and he just started laughing I mean it ... what do you say because you're right the President Obama probably would never said that\nBut he also a lot about Benghazi also a lot about fast and furious you also get a hundred fifty billion dollars to Iran I mean we could go on and on about what I disagreed with him on so the fact that he seemed more presidential appeared his presence was more presidential did that
