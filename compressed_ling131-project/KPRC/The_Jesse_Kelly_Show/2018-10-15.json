{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "A number of times a a and there will be lots of other Michael Bloomberg is spending a hundred million dollars in this election cycle to boost democratic candidates\nIn the hope of creating some gratitude toward him he's thinking of running he's about that same age mid Nineteen seven or\nA mid seventies but ah the person on top of that CNN poll is a former vice president Joe Biden who is a general like well like particularly by white working class voters in the mid west where Trump did show well to take democratic states\nAre away but they're going to be twenty twenty five Democrats who are vying to face off against Trump and lots of names we can't even imagine yet are going to or at least take a flier at it\nWell in addition to age though Joe Biden I mean he's got the reputation of being crazy Joe is he just kind of the liberal version of Donald Trump when it comes to some of the things he says and does\nWell he he does have a reputation of being a gaffe machine but if the if he has been in national politics since the middle of the Nineteen seventies she was elected to the United States Senate when he was twenty nine years old and you can't legally serve in the Senate until you're thirty\nSo he had when he became thirty and for the next thirty some years was\nIn the United States Senate lots of foreign policy experience and then eight years as vice president and so we might have some instability of Joe Biden were president but it would be a very different kind than uh than what we see with Donald Trump\nOr and it depends upon how the next couple of years of the first from term goal whether people are eager for more of it or to let them for a change\nWell that's the way it always is involved because you don't get your first report card in the first term and if things are going well economically we have a tendency to give you a passing grade in movie onto the next four years because it really is all about the economy\nUm I well yeah it is yeah I Will say this about President Trump you say what you want to like them or not he has a he has delivered\nOr attempted to deliver and virtually all of his promises and the first two years in office and that's almost unheard of yeah\nMost presidents have a checklist of promises that they've made it that\nDay or if they try to address even if they don't get exactly what they want to President Trump is down that share like because a number of things that he promised the border for example he's still working on the border wall he's got a little bit of money or but not that thirty ... billion that would take\nA to build the thing but some\nIssues like that are as good politically as they are if you actually accomplished so whether all ever get that wall built or not I don't know and some of the other things that he's dead or like promising to revise snap day he has got done\nBut the the new intellectual property requirements in NAFTA came right out of the TPP which she withdrew America from so there was a little bit of wobble and uh uh in some of his policies and sound is attempts to make good on campaign promises\nWere trying to ... from a as amusing political scientist and I'm sure you talk to students there all the time Cal what what are you telling them as far as um the future of politics how political campaigns have been changed by social media for example his Facebook and Twitter and all that\nCompletely changed the way the political campaigns run all across the country\n[noise] well they have uh the main the main difference is that campaigns used to be prosecuted national I say a presidential campaign\nOr with what you have a cold air wars campaign commercials going back and forth and today with a social media in general and Google and Twitter and Facebook are the ads if people can be targeted\nA down to specific interest that people have so it might be a couple of hundred people get the same message rather than a couple hundred million and so it's much more targeted and you can play on people's emotions and play on their their particular issue concerns\nIn the way you simply couldn't thirty or forty years ago so campaigning is very different but but what I tell students and while Charles ... is that\nMany people ah don't watch politics very closely don't follow issues are candidates very closely and so they can to be driven by by false claims a whereas if you read a newspaper a daily you'll be in the top ten percent\nOf most informed citizens so reader newspaper read time magazine read the economists watch the news hour rather than any either Fox News or MSNBC\nAnd you'll be in a position to understand what that politicians are talk about what they're offering a and whether they're making any sense at all\nWow you still read the newspaper ...\nAbsolutely [laughter] and I want to have to Jimmy as well you and I know I still I still do I still do um\nYou know we just have a tendency unfortunately to digest over information and in soundbites that I'm\nGetting your news off your phone you're not really getting much news\nWell and if you get your news out of certain newspapers you're getting a slant to so it's just you know just to go to so many different sources as possible because they're you know see what you want about Fox News and it doesn't sound like you're a man\nThere are stories that they are recovering um that the other side won't cover because it's you know it's it's positive towards the president so the truth almost always live somewhere in the middle of most of these things that you have to go to a variety of places is if you say you want to be well rounded if that's the ...\nIt it actually warm there last week we talked to her but Elizabeth Warren this was the big deal this morning you ... you open up the Twitter\nWhen you look at Twitter right now she was still there\nUm Cherokee Nation is trending Elizabeth Warren is completely off the trend and um for good reason\nThe claim was that she had proven her Native American ancestry she had proven but she's an American Indian the Boston Globe wrote this big long diatribe about how I'm Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts did a DNA test and it turns out she is as much as one thirty second\nA I'm a Native American doesn't stick Cherokee than say exactly what one thirty second four hours later they had to correct it to say well the most she uses one sixty fourth but then it turns out the least Native American she is is one one thousand twenty fourth\nThe carry on a simple guy as you tell me all the time yeah simple to and I think is the term you symbols that meant in many times during the dang civil so [noise]\nI'm predominantly Italian my father was a hundred percent Italian my mother is a quarter Italian so that makes me more than half Italian I've also got Irish English and polish from my mom's side\nSo the most I'm breaking it down to his maybe an eighth I can go in eighth probably less than an eighth she's going to one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd we're supposed to just buy that\nOh did you see how they measured it because they because Native American tribes American indian tribes and other tribes do not necessarily give up their DNA information mhm so they're saying that they're that one uh one thousand twenty fourth connection is possibly through South America somehow and it could be native\nCould be so it's not even it's not even one one thousand forty fourth definitively native could be\nThat nobody breaks down their DNA that far\nAnd by the way that also means that she's a big fat lie in liar because she's been saying that she probably this and she has so much Indian blood is she got this special dispensation at yeah with a Harvard wherever the hell was and she's the mix outline liar so the media went from she's now proven that she's a Native American too well\nThe president does a million dollars to charity you know what I mean they went from she's like you know sleeping in a way Guam\nAnd she's the queen of the Cherokee Nation [laughter] to now to now she's um she she wins over Trump who said take a DNA test improved to me that you're Indian and I'll I'll send a million dollars the favorite charity now I don't think cared even though she proves she's an Indian Indian American will be\nNative American or whatever I don't think that oh no\nSome of the funny me and said they had been raped will do all those all his proven she's more black than Elizabeth Warren is in fact Indian I'm a a another one was a if Elizabeth Warren is Indian ... because I guess the breakdown is\nThe vast majority of white Americans are far more Native American than she is I think this test actually proved that she's one of the widest people other than you and why does ... not the outlines of America I mean she so damn white\nCollar Casper around the around the Massachusetts state house now I'm so the bottom line is this they came out of the box guns guns blaring\nGot um God he's got to send a million dollars a game called Pocahontas anymore and she's an Indian she proved wrong damage nailed it to ... it's not even trying to give me more in fact before we hit the brake we've got breaking news just as we start the program the top trend is is pretty surprising if you give us you have that don't you\nI Do yeah oh Allen yeah yeah this is breaking Microsoft cofounder ... Palin has died at the age of sixty five he died this afternoon from complications of non Hodgkin's lymphoma and see Adel al unfounded Microsoft alongside Bill Gates in Nineteen Seventy five\nAnd amazing discovery a couple of amazing guys that that without whom we wouldn't be using these computers or not the way we're using them right now anyway that was startling news to get sixty five is not very old these days and now a sorry to hear about that we're certainly going to send to prior to his family are Elizabeth Warren thing is the top trend\nBack to the top story the media is trying to brush her under the rug now because it actually proved it actually disapprove which he's been saying for many many years\nAnd I guess the simple question I have an let's open up the phone lines it's eight nine four one bags editing nine four one Seventeen for seven the question I have is if you were advised lives with Warren don't you tell her to\nNot talk about this any more why the hell which he said this to the Boston Globe and and put this out there it was so easily proven to be fake news that I even have time to do a parity the carry you didn't you hear me do all the\n... and I've been here for a while yeah yeah not very ... [laughter] that are not all there yes yeah see that's not fair because I ... the same line that\nApparently I think hopefully he's putting down\nYes well I had to pull out All right [laughter] what part that I heard over and over and turn it over and over and over I I did have to leave it out and you and you know the people\nThat I was just gonna say and you have no idea how unfair it really was so why because we know we couldn't 'cause I didn't want to make you want to lose you so you couldn't shut down one fate or off yes but I didn't want to continue to talk to me\nSee 'cause you're you're actually enjoying it I Know you're you're pretend like I hate the parodies pulling out of the biggest fans of the priorities that we are now\nReally are guys that movement and this is a good one today now this is a British businessman or you're not you're not gonna say it's a good one now now what's your name and Pocahontas\nYeah again\nI might not even play it listen I'll look in the line you are down ... go to Joe parents don't know what I I I think she was focused on is\nWhat he calls her Pocahontas or I thought that he was calling the he has the full on work a lot of other people say folk on us but no he he actually says Pocahontas oh stop by the website Joe ... dot com click on on Twitter send me a tweet if you don't look if you don't want to hear that will play it up with a lot of walking like when you're in\nAnd it's about the other hand a shot of fair no I've already or maybe an aversion to have your attitude [laughter] oh and I'm\nNow clearly this is at the top of my range and no I'm not gonna take it down an octave I can already predict where people are going to say ... what can you sing songs are more than your range is too high for you well guess what buddy shut up [laughter] I'm ...

DNA that comes back as Native American and something that's actually an American Indian and the reality is when you do what do you test through ancestor dot com or twenty three and me and all of that stuff\nIt just says a Native American but a vast majority higher percentage of that are Native Americans from central and South America doesn't necessarily mean that they are American indian\nRight well what she's saying that she's Cherokee but this past ended up itself couldn't even delineate that it was anything that we had to do with American Indians in fact it looks like if there's any connection and it's a very little chance that there is it is South American Native Americans\nSo I mean I I ... and again one one thousand twenty fourth doesn't tell me much of anything I appreciate

go back at it and say hello to a line five is going to be Cindy in Texas I send me\nWell hey I\nQuestion yes my great grandmother was born on the Cherokee reservation guy\nIt makes you know one sixty where we did their research\nTo see if we were a qualified for it fits in Native Americans that hey\nOur blood line was to do it at once sixteenth my blood line which it delayed it right in the benefits of Native American right at eight tried with never registered\nOkay so we accepted okay no problem that's what my question is Elizabeth Warren criminally liable for it gets prodding that college where she got Native American funding for her education\nI'm going to say no I don't think it's against the law but certainly the college has I think at least civil recourse to say you lied to gain and for you lied to step up you lied to get ahead of a lot of other people so now you owe us you know some sort of punitive damages I think they could sue that way but I don't think it's against the law and this was a really\nUm ... it's a good question because it's a private school if it were a public school you might have a better case because you're now the following the government\nBut a Harvard ... is not it's a it's a private school so I think it's a good question but I'm going to say probably not\nJust trying to work it through my 'cause it's a great question but ah because it's a private school probably not\nLike if I lie on a job application you can't you can't have me arrested you could just hire me\nUm but if I Do that to a government subsidized or a taxpayer subsidized school maybe I think there might be might be a reach but certainly they have civil records to to get back any money so they were paid to her to get back uh any awards that were bestowed upon her because of her alleged heritage or knowing that it didn't happen that she isn't\nThat that's interesting if you're one six teams are not considered a part of the nation but if you're one one thousand twenty four ths\nSomehow was with Warner thing she was vindicated today that's nuts to me All right it is a eight eight eight nine four one ... editing nine four one Seventy four seven we come back\nWe're going to be David our son and he's a senior editor at the federalist about this whole debacle and much more to be [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nUnderneath her name said Warren proves her Native American ancestry I was like oh crap let's check this out and I was a bill into it\nThe most she appears to be Native American according to whatever this DNA test allegedly is is one thirty second and then the Boston Globe had to go back and actually correct that and make it one sixty fourth\nUm but the real chances are about one in a thousand twenty four so you've got a guy did you saw this breaking news it's all over the the Twitter in Trump somebody a million dollars now what were your first thoughts and I thought the article you wrote was really really very spot on\nBut I never really cared about her ethnicity to be honest with you you know I figure if she was probably making it up or that it was family lore and she went\nWith it the thing is that she could have said that uh\nMy family told me this thing I Want to celebrate this culture I just thought you know I just took them at their word when she didn't do that she double down on the DNA that's what shows her to be probably on average how Latin American Indian and in her than a normal white male and a ... person in America\nSo it makes me now that she actually was a fraud and I think we have a lot of evidence that use the Cherokee heritage to get ahead in her career\nAnd that you know I don't like judging people by like a meritocracy but at that and she's going to do then she's pushing out you know elbowing ask someone who's more deserving of the more deserving than she is\n... I'm with you and and be she did benefit from like I'll give you a quick example I'm over half Italian probably will be two thirds of telling and I'm also Irish English in polish there might be some other stuff in there I don't know my grandmother told me that were directly related to buffalo bill Cody I Can't prove it\nBut she said so I I'm not going to go and trying to get the Buffalo Bills Cody you know scholars should be cautious about a show have said that were related to Roger Williams who founded Rhode Island I might have been Rhode Island and say give me my my reparations I mean it just it it we all have that thing in our family where somebody says oh yeah\nYour great great great great grandfather started the railroad system in America that we go oh great that's awesome but this woman actually this is your problem right she actually benefited from it probably\nTook that that spot away from somebody who truly had that heritage\nThat exactly my problem with her but I was willing to forgive that she just for some reason thought it was true and ... for whatever reason but now with this president you know she has this rollout\nIs like five minute video celebrating this whole CNA what'd you just lose her point you know so that makes me think that the whole thing was a scam or in the beginning why they should try to do is make\nThis out it'd be like birth or isn't supposed to say that Donald Trump is racist or bringing this up but the fact of the matter is Donald Trump seems to be right about ... ... ... ... is a citizen is not jerky as far as we know she's not sure from the church in Asian\n... as a matter of fact the way that they they sort of got the indicators that she might be Native American it all is that they didn't really go with only Native American people they said well maybe South American so she could really be arguing time for all we know\nRight they use some South American DNA samples because many of the ... many of these tribes don't want to hand over their DNA that right reason like this [laughter] managed to become a senator or in the opening scene somewhere or or whatever you know they're they're doing\nOr each day with our son he going to follow him on Twitter first name David less than a J.
