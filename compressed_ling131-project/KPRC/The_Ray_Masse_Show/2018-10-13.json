and the order of ABC never changes\nUnfortunately many people approaching or in retirement apply the same sequence of letters to their investments\nFor example you might say my retirement accounts were at point hey now they are at point B so obviously there are going to eventually be at points see\nLet's explain this in numbers instead of letters you might be saying my retirement account had

retirement account was that point a than a route to point B\nSo obviously if you draw the line from point a through point be your retirement account will continue to grow on the same path to point see we see this train of thought over and over again as we look at the history of investments\nPoint eight in the beginning of the tech boom in Nineteen Ninety five point be the top of the tech boom and year two thousand and yet so many people bought or held on to stocks at point B expecting that stocks would continue to grow to point to say\nHere's another example point aid the start of the housing price bubble around Nineteen Ninety five point be the top of the housing bubble in two thousand six yet people were still buying houses like mad just before the housing bubble crashed expecting that they would continue to rise to point see\nWhat crashes next the bond market precious metals national debt the stock market again who knows all you can do is that just because your retirement account grew from point a to point B doesn't mean it is going to grow to point to see in fact points he might be lower than point hey if you're not careful\nWouldn't you rather have planning based on

then grew to point B so obviously it is going to continue to grow to some fictitious points see has been proven to be a delusional concept just like all delusions there is a clinical name for it\nIt is called the appeal to a probability the appeal to probability is defined as the assumption that something will happen because it can happen\nCould have stocks continued to rise instead of crashing after the dot com bubble yes that's possible could have housing prices continue to rise after two thousand six once again that's possible the problem is many investors take what is possible and they start to believe it is probable or worse yet a certain fact\nAdding fuel to the fire and there are plenty of people that contribute to this appeal to probability just watched the financial news on cable when the market goes up you can literally feel the energy coming from the talking heads on your TV there are so excited and happy when the market goes up just a hundred points in a day\nIt doesn't really make any sense of what does one day have to do with anything how was one day of stock market gains going to help you guarantee that you want to run out of money\nEvery one is jumping for joy about something that doesn't mean anything all too often one day of stock market games is like a sugar Russia after eating a candy bar lots of energy for a while but in a couple of hours is

called the gambler's fallacy\nGamblers believe that because there is the possibility of winning for everyone that it is probable that they will be the one that wins after all if a gambler didn't think his odds were better than everyone else has he would never play\nBetting on the stock market during the critical years of your retirement could also be called a gallon gambler's fallacy you know your fellow retirees are losing money yet you think somehow it will be different for you\nI don't mean to be insulting here but investing your money in stocks bonds mutual funds verbal products all during your retirement is gambling and unless you are very wealthy you have to ask yourself if you can afford to become a loser\nDid you know that if your retirement account declines by twenty five percent this year it would need to grow by thirty three percent the following year just to break even if it declined by thirty three percent it would need to grow by fifty percent the following year to get your money back if it declined by fifty percent\nYour retirement account would need to grow by one hundred percent the following year just to poke your head above water\nWhy lived through the stress

reverse\nMore you know what you call and ask questions and learn about it and what you know then we can do it with the we can do to reverse mortgage\nFor you but I Want you to understand it and and know all about it a first question how old I had to be\nYou must be sixty two years or older and if you're married both of you must be sixty two years or older\nThere is no average in ages have an eighty year old and a forty year old or\nA Seventy in a fifty or sixty whatever uh you got to both be sixty two are older I'm trying to make that as clear as I can can I get calls every week people well I'm Seventy five and my wife fifty eight why can't we do it you know when you ... it's just a Texas last ... both must be sixty two\nAh who own the house that's probably the biggest myth biggest myth out there you own a home\nAnd when you die you're Arizona home it's not the government's home it's not the mortgage companies home it's you're home you're on the deed\nAnd when you die your your your or a spouse can lived there until they die and then when you both uh then it goes to your heirs typically your children so it's not the government's home or the banks home at your home and then your children's home\nAnd then let's say to you both passed away you say well what are my children do well first Ninety Days a year not doing anything that's for grievance period\nAnd then you get six months to sell the home you list it sell it if you had sold it usually give you another six months of his list it so that gives you a year and three months to fellow fans hold it by then you're probably asking too much but then they sell the home\nPay off the markets keep the different stuff you're selling for three hundred thousand and you pay off a hundred thousand and they keep the two hundred\nThat's how it works and that's how it is\nA the next question my favorite one is how much will the payments be\nPayments are the same whether you borrow four thousand forty thousand or four hundred thousand all reverse mortgage\nBorrowers have this exact same payment cause that's zero zero for life some people say I outlive my\nA reverse mortgage you can't because it doesn't have a finite time it has a time when you pass away not in years like five years ten years Twenty years fifty energy live a hundred years than God Bless you that's a long time but uh you don't have to make any principal interest payments for a hundred years if you live a hundred years\nSo it's I don't think you could outlive the reverse mortgage\nAnd remember at your home stays in your family if you give it to your kids [noise]\nOkay what if I have a mortgage and I'm a home and that's really what got me into this business and a gentleman called at my ministry that's what I'm doing I'm Mr
