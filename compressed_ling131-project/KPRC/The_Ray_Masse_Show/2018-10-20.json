of still invest the money yes that's what my wife and I did we we were going to pay cash for that somebody saw this a opportunity to\nPay a down payment on the house still get zero payments which is what you're shooting for when you're paying off houses is not have any monthly payments so then we take the money we didn't spend on the house we put in our savings right now we're getting about seven percent\nTax free not taxed for tax free so one day when we made it will start saying Seventy three thousand four thousand a month and they'll come in handy towards our retirement\nOr do I need a lot of money to to qualify an answer is no because all loans are based on how much you make and how much expenses are so when you normally ... or something like Homer car they forgot your payment\nAnd then they have to figure that into your expenses so but I went with a reverse mortgage your payment zeroes there's nothing to figure and so it's a lot easier qualify for verse Marty's then is conventional mortgage\nOr one of my home is clear ... and that's a good really one of the really great questions because the guy says you know ... clear I don't want a mortgage on it well the whole
