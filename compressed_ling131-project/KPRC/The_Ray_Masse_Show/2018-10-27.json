you to do a reverse mortgage a hundred percent understand so the whole thing [noise] it's just a choir [noise]\nOkay we're going to take a break [noise] ah me back just a few minutes thank you [noise]\n\n\nHe has said welcome to the right mass to reverse mortgage show much talked about a government program that are out there that can help everyone at sixty to an older\nSocial Security checks and then they by sending those back I Know my wife and I don't turn our back but they've really been great and I know there are for you to and the second one of course when you're sixty five you get Medicare which we do\nAnd then the third one is reverse mortgage but a lot of people just don't know what reverse mortgages are and I'm a briefly go through the first session but we were talking about is how old are you have to be you have to be sixty two years or older\nYou can be a hundred if you want to but you have to be at least sixty two if you're married both of you have to be sixty two in the state of Texas\nWho alone home you own a home not the mortgage cutting out the government you own a home I Would do in this bar in a small part of your uh equity in your home to to help you pay it off or get some extra cash so you own a home and then by the way when you pass away your airs on though so it stays in the family doesn't go\nTo the mortgage company or the bank or the government just don't let people a lot of people try to tell you an advantage and everything but usually they're ignorant of the program and all you're getting his ignorant advice and that's that doesn't plus all well\nAnd then how much are the payments bay they're going to be zero for the rest of your life never ever make a principal interest payment again you're still make your property taxes you're still pay you a homeowner's insurance and if there's a homeowners' association digit by that but no principle interests even if we give you two or three hundred thousand dollars you still don't pay\nA principal enters if you have a mortgage that's what I'm here for that really want to help the people that are more just I Do not like\nUh we have no payments for life\nAnd then when we die we're going to heaven way of Jesus in our heart and we hope you do too but uh he's our savior and and they don't charge me any ran up and in heaven so I've got uh my wife and I have zero payments for eternity here in and have and you can to\nYour love Jesus ... back I tell the outage shut and that just from the rooftops too so I'm\nAll right we've got that question out of the way and that makes one wonder if I Want to purchase a home and that's what my wife and I did we we lived in ... of memorial in big two story in a big pool and we you know yet in her seventies wish that we need a single story and a smaller pool so we went to Katie and we bought one from David weekly\nBuilt it actually and turned out David weekly and his wife both went to memorial high school where my wife taught and she taught both of them in fact his wife was my wife's ah student writer and they built is an awesome ... they're they're really good builders and and we're proud of our home we're proud of them\nOkay so if you if you purchase your home\nOr and you get cash adamant can you still use the savings account yes\nIf I like my wife and I did we purchased it we're we're going to pay cash and we ... we didn't have to put down you know we paid a down payment and finance the balance with zero payments forever for eternity and um we used the rest of their money put in and save as mass right we're getting read at seven percent tax free\nNot taxed for tax free and so we're letting grow and grow and then one day we'll say hey destruction there's three thousand four thousand a month\nOr for the next ten or Fifteen Years whatever and um so we just used it for retirement and you can't tell you all this was available but it's only available if you make the call call me an eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOkay next question do I need a a lot of income in order to qualify and the answer's no because when people figure your expenses versus your income of giving you a loan they have to factor into how much your payments going to be on that home well\nYour primary zero so it's just easier to qualify and if you have no payment\nOr when you're talking about income\nSo I did a I got one lady approved she only made twelve hundred dollars a month but she didn't have mixed fences and it all worked out\nSo give me a call you have to call I Can't help you if you don't call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred re messy M A s that seem a reverse mortgage eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nOf chain next question what if my homeless Claire\nYes if you're homeless player is nice to have a clear home because you don't have payments\nBut that home isn't giving you one check one dollar a month nothing is what you do and you're spending money to live there you know you're paying property taxes and you're paying in church and you're\nPaying ... in many cases than you sometimes you need to root for an air conditioner or painting or whatever\nHow old you are very expensive so why not use a little bit of that equity in your home get some cash I've given people up to three or four hundred thousand dollars cash\nSo it just depends on how expensive your home is and how old you are but we're going to take a short break we'll be\nBack on the other side of the state's fast I think it is because we really love love love them enough to see the side [noise]\n[noise]\nYes then come back to the re Massey reverse mortgage of ... really thrilled to be here still the thrill to be in Houston, Texas to the United states is just south\nOf life is good I was good uh we want to talk about to reverse Marty's we've been talking about it for the last recession but a lot of you are just downturn in and I'm and explain what the reverse mortgages and and how it works and uh\nHow it's one of three major\nGovernment programs you know we pay taxes on her life so why not take advantage of everything is that we can what's available to us especially his senior citizens when we start to me the most to help\nThe first government programs Social Security checks and you know we all get those and then I don't know even the rich people send those back it's just it's just a wonderful program for\nFor everyone to retire on and then the second one is Medicare and when you turn sixty five where you could\nTake that and then the third one is reverse mortgage but\nA lot of people are familiar with reverse mortgage or maybe they've heard some negative things about it that aren't true ah because you know you have everybody always says oh don't do that they'll do that there's there's just a lot of negative is at out there and I all I Do is fight in the program to you'll see it's an awesome program\nWe pay taxes on our life what I take advantage of the reverse mortgage broker number six to ... let me give you some qualifications and also how it works\nOn reverse Marge is how do I have to be you must be sixty two years or older there's no top and you can be a hundred that matter in eighty nine hundred but there is a bottom you've got to be sixty two are older and if you're married both of you must be sixty two are older\nSo you can't be Seventy ... sixty and say well that's a hundred and thirty has about that back to that sixty five or ... or older\nWho will own the house that's the biggest misnomer out there you own the house not the mortgage company not the government your names on the deed and not only that but when you pass away your your spouse owns it when both the pass away your kids on it or whoever you left it to your airs on it so it's not the government's home mature home\nAnd and always will be\nOr how much will my payments they and that's the really exciting thing about the program yeah because you know some people might bar four thousand forty thousand four hundred thousand it doesn't matter everybody has the same payment the payment is zero for life\nYou know you have people say well I have somebody that he ... he outlived is reverse mortgage impossible\nReverse mortgage goes until you die and then if your spouse's lab till he or she dies\nSo you can't outlive your reverse mortgages\nWhat if I have a mortgage on my home and that's what I really try to reach out that's part of my ... [laughter] ah what we call a ministry now trying to help ... a senior citizens and their economic situations and\nAnd uh uh sure it's a business but you know it it it's fun to help people\nUh that need help in anything whether it's financial whatever food or whatever and and I know that can help a lot of people out there that need it and maybe you're not the poorest maybe not the richest should this I can help all kinds of people\nSo if you have a mortgage on your home and you have enough equity and you're sixty tour older and your spouse if you're married is sixty two older\nThere's no reason for you not to call me call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nI can help you if you have enough equity in your home is that's based on what two pounds worth and how much you know\nAnd then what's your ages and that tells me how much reverse mortgage acting in many cases not only do I pay it off and keep those darn payments and make them go away every month for you\nI can give you cash in addition so let's say you qualify for two hundred thousand dollar reverse mortgage e oh fifty thousand on your home we pay off to Fifteen give you a hundred and fifty\nSo I mean it's their folks you're putting it out there for you so why not check into it or at least Enquirer mean don't listen to these people say oh it's a bad thing don't call thing I mean that makes sense to me uh\nI gave me example um but I tell people that said if somebody said re a you've got three thousand dollar payment\nI can make it go away and your payments got to be zero for life\nThat you know how fast I can say I'll take the zero I mean he wouldn't get that last word out of his mouth for say ... I'd say give me that zero\nAnd uh it makes sense it's just like if somebody said right Eileen do a million dollars or a billion dollars and you don't have to make any payments until after you die\n... then it gets paid off I mean given tend to give me the million or billion it it it's it's a\nIt's a no brainer folks but\nCan't help you let you make that phone call 'cause I got to meet you got to talk to you on the phone that if you want to make will meet everything's free the phone calls frame I visit ts for your visit to me is free whenever you want to do that I'm here to help you but you need to make that first phone call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred okay the next question as\nIf I if I did give your money what\nCan you do with the money and the answer is whatever you want you're not limited to what you can do you can pay off bills always pay officers charged cards first and then maybe your car and\nThat you don't have any bills that's great just put it in savings account like my wife and I did that are near six point two percent tax free and I'd say it's actually not taxed for interest on your money so let it grow\nYou know you put a hundred thousand and let grow grow grow when you needed a take it all out of your one or just say send me a couple of thousand a month you know sure money you can do whatever you like with it\nI Wonder if I Want to purchase a home and that's what my wife and I did we purchased a homing and Katie and love it and it's a smaller a it's a one story a smaller pool and we love it would just made a down payment and no payments forever", "show_name": "The Ray Masse Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "27"}
