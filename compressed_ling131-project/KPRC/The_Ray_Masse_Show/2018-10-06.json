advanced planning incorporates estate planning for your beneficial ways to make sure that your money is passed on to your heirs as you wish with minimal delay and minimal taxes\nHas your broker or advisor after you how you feel about your money or or what you want your money to do for you\nWhen brokers and advisors are more concerned about making in income for themselves they usually don't ask these questions they're more concerned about getting their money into a brokerage account or variable annuity so they can start charging either high fees year after year\nI see it as my responsibility to keep fees and commissions from eating away at your hard earned money yes I have to make some money but I make my money from the financial companies that I represent you will not be charged iffy by me and you will not be charged a transaction fee by these companies\nIt is so important to keep your money safe and not let it get lost fees and charges even a so called small recurring fee of one to

how\nTo re Massey reverse mortgage oh [noise]\nHe used to this is ray mess with the massive reverse mortgage so excited to be here journalists than have a new day\nI came here so you know we're all we're Harold Saturdays from three to four pm every Saturday So listen when you can and and it could really help your retirement years\nTo reverse mortgage is one of three major programs that the federal government established for retirement age people\nOf course the first one was Social Security\nAnd a what a great program that turned out to be ah I don't see by turn return to those Social Security checks of most people must like it I Know myself and my wife were not returning of our church where it's just really helped us as we got older or in our seventies now and it's just an awesome program then when we turn sixty five we've got Medicare\nBut now the thing that most people don't know about is reverse mortgages and how it works they've been ... you know some knowledge of it but not enough and it's certainly not correct\nOr the reverse mortgages originally come into effect in Texas in two thousand one and it\nTakes care of people that are sixty to an older than you know we pay our taxes on our lives so we want to take care of every ... can especially in our retirement years so the best way I can explain reverse mortgage is I'll go through questions and answers\nAnd I'm trying to explain the program to you but what I Need you to do if you're sixty two are older and you own a home whether it's clear\nOr whether you're having a mortgage on it doesn't matter or if you want to purchase a home new argues that can be a hundred years old I don't care new ideas this call eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred raped Massey reverse mortgage and then what we'll do all explained I'll call you back says I'm off the air and and we can talk to call this free up some of your home if you want me to explain things to use your children anybody what\nAre you can come to my home but it's all free that calls for individuals free or so why wouldn't you I mean if you're sixty two older than you own a home whether you have a mortgage or ... or it's free and clear doesn't matter you it is a program that the government established that can help you\nAnd it certainly helped me and my wife and I have a reverse mortgage and we're thrilled with it and just did one for my sister and a bunch of my close friends and of course lots of lots of people off the radio so let's get under the questions let's find out what is a reverse mortgage and how it works\nFirst off how old are you have to be to draw a reverse mortgage the answer is\nYou have to be sixty two years or older and there's no top aging be Ninety a hundred whatever your uh but but you must be sixty two are older and if you are married you and your spouse miss most be sixty two are older\nYou can't have a Seventy five and a sixty an average it out it's got to be both of your six to ... to an older at least in a state of Texas and that's where I Do business anywhere Texas if you're in Dallas Austin San Antonio doesn't matter where we are here in Texas I can help you second question\nWho will do the whole that's a big myth out there that people say oh you own your home anymore the mortgage company ... or the government on it or they'll take it away from it and that's really that is totally false and uh the home is in your name your names on the deed\nAnd if you're married and one of your pass away they are then we can stay there till they passed away and there's no end to end there's no five year ten year twenty year can be a hundred years do you live in another hundred years that's fine you know payments no principle and interest payments for as long as you live there\nAnd if you want a movie you can you know you're not stuck at it if you decide you want to move a what the next month next year ten years whatever you want to and that's fine just move sell the house use the proceeds to pay off to a mortgage keep the rest of it and move then we can do another reversed and it has to move to\nSo they don't believe people say it's not your home they're going to take it away it's just not true the third question is uh how much for the payments bay\nThat's always my favorite question I mean I just love it you know why because what you were four thousand or forty thousand or four hundred thousand everybody that has a reverse mortgage has this in common there payment is exactly the state\nAnd the reason is the same because there is no payment is zero zero for life\nNo payments for life and hopefully you're a Jesus in your heart my wife and I do we know that when we die we're going to heaven and there's no payments up there either so we as zero payments for eternity and you can to just live Jesus they love you right back but getting back to the reverse mortgage you don't have any payments forever\n[noise] okay what if I have a mortgage on my home and and that's really what got me into the reverse mortgage business uh one gentleman the other day said it sounds like in some ministry for you you want to help people and then there's sort of a ministry I Want to help seniors\nThat may be struggling all paying ... a payment on their home and are the other thing that could happen is if you're homeless clear and you're just not making\nA enough money anymore you know as we get older we don't make as much uses Social Security and uh you could use the extra funds for your retirement so let's say we give you a hundred thousand dollars cash and\nUh you put it in our savings account we set up for you with a reverse mortgage to earn about six point two percent tax free and that's not tax deferred it's tax free\nThen you got another six or seven thousand dollars worth of\nA income coming in and you'll be tax free so a lot of times I just put you in a much much better position and you know we go to bed at night we wanted about paying that payment tomorrow in our house and it causes a lot of stress for people and stress can call it cause illness and of course even cause of death\nSo are the those no payments forever for eternity way I'd like to call it\nIs it's just an awesome pro government you know if you're sick detour older comedy called eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nAnd there's always something to do to our house so it it it doesn't throw you off any money it costs you money but we do a reverse mortgage depending on the price of your home and your age\nMaybe we can give you a hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand four hundred thousand depends on your age and your and then a which are homeless were so called they call it five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred I'd love to talk to your loved explained the whole program to you I don't expect you to call and say hey I wanted to reverse mortgage I Want you to call and ask questions so you feel comfortable with it if you want me to come to your home with your your kids anybody\nA outcome free or you can come to my home and feel like some that have more people to St liquor coming amount which is fine I Love it uh but I Can't help you unless you help yourself as a as the old saying is true if you want this kind of program to help you through your senior years\nYou need to call me eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nEight five five to six six sixteen hundred it's re Massey MA SST ... lifetime you sodium my wife's a lifetime is Tony and we've been here forever and ever 'cause we're in our seventies and\nYou can help you uh that can help you if you know make the call and don't be afraid of is like they say you know when you get older and you're sitting there was you know want anything to do and don't want to change or\nThere's a million reasons for like a ... bill for the SARS and put some nice spring water in a new is Thursday walk them over there and he wouldn't take a lick he's either scared or because his brand new or maybe one of those horses out there in the field told him\nOh don't drink that water as bad water just like people telling you don't go to reverse mortgage that's a bad\nDeal is not a bad deal is a wonderful deal the government's not in the habit of offering your like Social Security and Medicare and reverse mortgages if it's not going to help you and we pay taxes all of our lives some others longer than others but uh but um for gosh over sixty years I guess\nAnd uh I took advantage of this program ah with my wife and we're thrilled that we did now we have a\nLot better ah lifestyle with our with our retirement a lot larger comfort level and we can do and you if you owe ... money on your house called me a because well if you have enough equity we can pay it off and give your money\nAnd sometimes a lot of money or if you don't do anything on your home that's fine to weaken it gives you a small portion of your\nEquity you still have plenty of equity for if you ever want to move or leave two kids and it still your home and doesn't go away you're

you're sick deter over\nA if you want to take the cash would give you in a co pay off bills you can do anything you want with it if you want to leave it in a letter grow and grow and then take a

last recession but a lot of of you are just out to the men and I'm and explain what the reverse mortgages and and how it works and uh\nHow it's one of three major\nGovernment programs you know we pay taxes on her life so why not take advantage of everything that they were chanting what's available to us especially a senior citizen when we start to me the most out the first government programs Social Security checks and you know we all get those and\nThen I don't know even the rich people send those back it's just it's just a wonderful program for\nFor everyone to retire on and then the second one is Medicare when you turn sixty five we took that then the third one is reverse mortgage but\nA lot of people are familiar with reverse mortgage year maybe they've heard some negative things about it that aren't true uh because you know you have everybody always says oh don't do that they'll do that there's there's just a lot of negative is out there and I all I Do is play in the program to you'll see it's an awesome program\nWe pay taxes are alive what I take advantage of the reverse mortgage broker mature six to ...\nBut let me give you some of the qualifications and also how it works\nOn reverse mortgage how do I have to be you must be sixty two years or older there's no top and you can be a hundred that matter in eighty nine hundred but there is a bottom you got to be sixty two are older if you're married both of you must be sixty two are older\nSo you can't be Seventy ... sixty and say well that's a hundred and thirty has about that back to that sixty five I got to both be six deter older\nWho will own the house that's the biggest misnomer out there you own the house not the markets cutting the not the government your names on the deed and not only that but when you pass away your your spouse owns when both the pass away your kids on it or whoever you left it to your airs on it so it's not the government's home mature home\nAnd it always will be\nOr how much will my payments they and that's the really exciting thing about the program because you know some people might bar four thousand forty thousand four hundred thousand it doesn't matter everybody has the same payment the payment is zero for life\nYou know you have people say well I have somebody that he ... he outlived is reverse mortgage impossible\nReverse mortgage goes until you die and then if your spouse's life just he or she dies so you can't outlive your reverse mortgages\nWhat if I have a mortgage on my home and that's what I really try to reach out that's part of my book [laughter] uh what we call a ministry now trying to help ... a senior citizens and their economic situations and\nAnd uh uh sure it's a business but you know it it is fun to help people\nUh that need help in anything whether it's financial whatever food or whatever and and I know that can help a lot of people out there that need it and maybe you're not the poorest maybe not the richest should I can help all kinds of people\nSo if you have a mortgage on your home\nAnd you have enough equity and you're sixty two are older and your spouse if you're married to sixty tour older\nThere's no reason for you not to call me called eight five five to six six sixteen hundred eight five five to six six sixteen hundred\nI can help you if you have enough equity in your home is that's based on what the pounds worth and how much you know\nAnd then what you're ages and that tells me how much reverse mortgage I can do in many cases not only do I pay it off and keep those darn payments and make them go away every month for you but I can give you cash in addition", "show_name": "The Ray Masse Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "06"}
