last one you saw Chris don't even try\nSo but that is something they reserve that beating somebody that has something they reserve for the people they hate the most\nThat is not a it's not it doesn't mean nothing the way the mafia kills you\n\nIt means something\nI mean a lot of times you see these guys these ... guys got two in the back of his said that it just it's just sees you said that's just somebody they want a debt\nThat they beat you to death\nThat something different you are you guys have seen that movie everybody but Chris I'm sure has casino\nAnd it was based on a lot of it was based on a true story they changed the names around and do you remember Joe ... character in that movie he was a short little mafia spit fire used to fight everybody always yelling at every one and everything in real life his name was Tony ... or ... it was his name but Tony I mean obviously he's a talented they all go by Tony\n[noise] well what they did to him in that movie is not necessarily reality but\nIt's Dan close to it you make enough people mad and the mob they don't just kill you they kill ya ugly and they beat him to death and they threw him in a in a whole not quite dead and they buried him and that's what they do and that's what happened and what he Bolger\nNow I Know a lot of you may not be into organized crime like I Am but I think that it's just endlessly fascinating\nFor a man who ends his life in eighty nine and let me tell you that the guy had it coming I don't do a lot of\nOf death things right after the jokes that such a sensitive subject with so many people but when it comes to complete scum bags who spent their life murdering other people yeah that that the world's better place we're just bought\nHe got what he had coming to him I Believe one of his victims daughters my computer fraud so I'm just going off memory here I Believe one of his victims daughters immediately took to Twitter\nAnd celebrated his demise so that tell you what kind of guy as there that's is that human being but still fascinating Schumann fasten it\nVery much so\nTrump throughout I Know I'm supposed to get to the big news everybody got I got distracted with all my awesome\nHalloween stuff Trump or floated out the idea\nOf doing an executive order\nTo change the fourteenth amendment and what you immediately saw was every make believe constitutional scholar in the world\nGo to their Twitter account or Facebook account and start putting up their definitive opinion I don't know about what he can do that money can't do and as you all know I have three very prestigious years ... accredited community college well almost three years\nBut I'm not a legal expert I'm certainly not a constitutional expert though I Know my constitution so I'm not going to bother trying to pretend\nI Am with something like that I Will just say this\nThe left wants to border open but half the right wants to border open to there are\nA ton of ... on the right who cannot seem to get out of their own way they're beholden to their GOP donors who want the cheap labor coming across the border and that is the reason the border is not secure if Trump wants to secure the border\nIf he's if frankly he's taken as many steps to see you can as president to secure\n\nIf Trump wants to secure the border\nAnd members of the GOP are going to stand up against him that's fine the guys and the GOP don't work for Trump they're supposed to work together the separate\nBranches but what I don't want to hear is if you've been this gigantic weeny your whole life on the immigration\nAnd you're like oh we can't be too hard I mean we can't deport everybody how what kind of drugs or do we look like if we're stopping people at the border do we want to be your country with walls\nYou guys know exactly what I'm Talking about you've seen these nerds for years\nAnd it all translates into the same thing I'm conservative right up to the point where it gets uncomfortable and that I'm not conservative anymore it ... seconds ...\nSeconds me if you're in a nation as we are we're forty to fifty percent of the population\nDoes not believe in limited government which is our constitution that's our country if you're in a nation and like that like we are\nAnd you think you can be a quote conservative without offending anybody you're insane if you're not offending anybody conservative\nYou not\nThink about that and now it's time for all the stories\nWe didn't get to [noise] retailers are gearing up to take on Amazon this holiday season I think it's awesome for the small businesses in smaller companies are trying to take on a juggernaut like Amazon we as an American people\nIn the interests of preventing these huge monopolies need to make sure we patronize the small businesses we need to make sure we help them out and you should do that while I shop at Amazon\nSay after I see a plane crash in Wisconsin lake and rescuers couldn't find a body they track the pilots who was home turns out he hitched a ride there after the crash I don't understand why he's in trouble he's doing what every single man would do if he crashes\nPlane into a lake you swim to shore you saw him and hold you pour a gigantic glass of whiskey and you get ready to have to explain to your wife\nAs soon as she walks in the door\nThey might chi is reconsidering its ties to Saudi Arabia following the murder of ... but many others will continue to accept money from the kingdom if only we had any previous indication that Saudi Arabia is not on the up and up\nThey started letting women drive like three months ago\nNot that they should have dozens of which is treated in their broomsticks for\nTitles in Oregon hundreds of Oregon which is titled die on the river MINUSTAH brooms I had no idea women's march had a parade down rivers do us food regulators are rethinking what can be called healthy could pizza bagels chewing gum\nIn bottled water be able to use the term why do scientists always act like they have\nA monopoly on knowledge of some kind we all know what's healthy what's healthy is all the stuff that tastes like crap what's good is the stuff that tastes good\n\nWhat's good as the stuff I served my kids what's healthiest the stuff the wife serves the kids\nYou know what they love their mother\nBut they get excited if she has to take off for something around mealtime\nIt's waffle house time baby\nRight mia Jesse it I Am Jesse Kelly dot com Chris you were also today she didn't have to do much [noise]\nThis will not of course include person born in the United states who are foreigners\nAliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons that's right not\nForeigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents who are green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners\nFor the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and they were dropping some and it was never there intention\nThat this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child as a citizen this has led to some open it outright scams of the system most notably with the citizenship a or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nAnd there but all stories on that so we're in California in particular you have people from East Asia\nWho will fly to California and stay in a a specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is that uh they're\nWhen they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child that citizenship in this country and they can then go back to let's say mainland China or wherever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older\nThey already have citizenship well gee that's that's a pretty that's a pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to\nBe a commodity that people can just sort of snacks for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it than that\nAnd we obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving\nBut all of it as a citizen right oh but this person to citizen people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business and they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law and they ... or a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interests of those in the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country or another that's all it's unfair but life is unfair\nAnd nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yeah some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist\nAnd then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here what your data crafts really what the Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believe that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person has citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely that later\nOn that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras because that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you're waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a true maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you're not in the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality if you\nHave that child\nIn America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family reunification\nRation ... chain migration ... bringing or as the family and so all the news at one kid in America I Know you're already at the front\nOf the line when it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child that's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the ... Center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nOne in five and twenty forty seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to an immigrant whether legal or illegal\nAnd illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty four teams believe that three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United states\nBut it's not just a three hundred thousand or so I remember that's a few years ago it could be even higher now it's a three hundred thousand plus then the likely sponsoring of their entire family for unification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here legally and you had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families so forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family\nFor a for a legal immigration system\nAh forget about that right because now which you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor\nBaby right it it just actually gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his parents doing something that is a illegal right\nThe crossing into the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe that but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of\nA of a distancing act hear from Republicans I'm ... I'm seeing this now now now it's\n... this is a problem whenever you have a celebrity that starts to get cozy with the GOP there are there are always going to let you down I I've been saying it certainly said a lot of rising I think I've said it on the show bunch to\nA British or Mike if I'd been predicting this I think I've been predicting this\nYep yup yeah that just wait you know he's going to turn on us and we're going to go oh gosh now I think he's really just more said he's out of it now Mike what's what's the real deal here he's he's saying he's ... he's been used so clearly there's a little bit negative situation there and he distancing himself from politics right that's what driving that's what he's saying\nSo it's not like I hate Donald Trump but you know remember this was a guy that's at George Bush hates black right so you know he has said some inflammatory stuff in the past\nAnd get your opinion on what do you think he's a new operating by the Trump\nHandbook of creating chaos to you know create a bigger name for himself and fell more ... gay apparel and your music\nOh after a dude absolutely and I know I Know you think that oh yeah of course of course ... is all about marketing I mean it is music is is kinda it's catchy but I don't think anyone\nSits around like wow Conyers changed you know change what it is to listen to like contemporary hip hop or anything\nUh I I think that he's very good at getting attention and marketing and in the current environment whether it's politics or you know mass media and entertainment that's like Ninety percent of the game you know you have to have a product that's okay but you can take a very mediocre product and sell the bejesus out of it\nUm by getting a lot of attention for it you know ... and and getting a lot of people to sit around and talk about it in and get free marketing I mean look ... visit to the White House Mike and we were trying to put a dollar figure on that what do we think that's worth that there was a marketing I mean clearly it's worth\nI Would argue it's worth tens of millions of dollars a free a free publicity absolutely like it if you were to pay a publicity for him to get you that level of attention in the national news media ... you're looking at an eight figure media by yeah I mean you'd have to be enormous and all he had to do is be like yeah I like Trump and ... and all this yet but and actually you know he's in the oval\nOffice yeah and that's always an Oval Office right and you know I I think\nA lot of ... I mean look I Know I expected a lot of us did but the good news is I wasn't sitting around with Conyers changing the conversation [laughter] I'm like no you're not changing the conversation I mean he's changing the conversations\nThat it's about ... but that's not something that I think we all need to sit around and celebrate I mean you know a good good for him a but I I never thought that he was a ... a reliable ally for conservatism so this is not\nThis does not surprise me I I Do I look I if I went back and was the shows I Know that said I don't think everyone needs to bash the guy he should be allowed to you know should be allowed to approach trumpet say these things I don't think he's that\nCrazy and they did get some uh they did get some\nPeople out of prison and you know there there were some good stuff that was done here I can I can say that the conversation I think the conversation Trump Tanya was interesting just won a spectacle but two there were some points made that were worthwhile\nBut you know look this is why conservatives and we we always seem to remember this we have heroic ideas and ideals we do not really have heroes [noise]\n\nFive bucks a month called Texas runners dot com today Seventy one three eighty six nine rent that seven won three eight six nine rent we filmed a TV commercial for top\nTax defenders and um they had some of the people that they've helped come in and I got to meet him and it was interesting because\nThere were guys that were several of them were small business owners probably\nTwenty twenty five of them and the different stories of what happens and how things happen and\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that\nMore people see Democrats inaction before\nThis midterm coming up in a week the better by the way\nYou keep keep having these little moments that pop up or you go oh wow okay so that Democrat who is positioning himself or herself as\nYou know somewhat of a moderate on some of these issues and a person who work with the other side may be you know very very I anti Trump obviously almost all the Democrats have to take this very anti Trump position but yeah there's some people that are at least\nMaking a going through the motions of being not completely insane leftist but then you see what ends up happening or you see what happens with the candidate you see what happens with the supporters uh you know ... Andrew Gillum\nIs an example of somebody who I I don't know how you\nCan think he's a good idea for the state of Florida I mean I've we've played it on this show and the Florida election I think is probably going to get more national attention than any other election and his mentor\nBut Gillum is a guy who a lot of people focused on obviously he's a young telegenic African American and you know so and and the state of Florida politically\nIs a kind of Lynch Penn State for anybody in twenty twenty and that's why you know when you when you look at this and you try and assess\nThe conversation around this raise you got to remember that it's not just even about this it's about how it sets up the the future or for the Democrat Party\nAnd you know this kind of give them though we've we've talked or we've talked about it before on the show doesn't know how we pay for some of these programs doesn't know how he would uh actually improve health care it really when it comes down to is a lot of these politicians they they talk of the game about how they're going to get more health care to people really it's just they're going to raise\nTaxes and expand Medicaid that's all it's going to be raised taxes expand Medicaid and Medicaid health outcomes are really poor and you're not going to get better health care outcomes just by having more state dollars thrown into programs\nYou know we we've seen this with schools\nYou can spend a lot of money on schools and have them be bad you can spend a whole lot ... a lot less money on schools and have them be good but the lid answer is always just more money for schools\nThat's more money more money and when you look and pull it apart\nYou actually get into the nuts and bolts of what's happening in our education system which you see is that the money isn't going to the\nKids it's not even one of the teachers go into these bureaucrats that administrators the teaching system what do you thing happens with the state state paid for medical systems a tremendous amount of waste and abuse so I mean given image to a bad idea but you also get a sense he's kind of a it's kind of a nasty guy\nUm you know he's very very willing to uh say whatever you think she has to say about the opposition which I guess it's sort of all Democrats these days but it play fourteen\nMonths of the fact is is the given too much harbor a to re citizens\nYou know anti Semite or he himself when he became the Republican nominee went on Fox News said to the voters afloat and that's a monkey the the the price\nRace has been an issue from the very beginning and this campaign that because I introduced is having\nMy grandmother used to have the same [noise]\nThat because you're both get dirty but he actually like\nWhat the what to do is a threat to the gutter yeah but I [noise] because they can survive getting dirty\nNow let me just take a moment to stand back with you and just admire what what happened there\nThat is a rhetorical technique known as ... veteran CEO is I could talk about how my opponent is a complete\nMoron who would be nowhere without his family money but I'm not\nTo do that it is doing the thing that you say you will not do as a form of attack and a a predator CEO in this case\nIs on full display he says well you know the census said monkey it up about the state and he's clearly saying just ended as a racist that's what that is but\nThen they pay in this is nonsense\nPeople will say there was like oh they ... they'll they'll there'll be paying taxes to really\n\nA vast majority of of people who are earning what illegal aliens earn are going to over the course of their lifetime take much more and government benefits and they pay in taxes even close\nSo how does this make us wealthier better off with the country by the way we're always hearing about how divided we are as a nation oh we're so divided okay how is it supposed to make us less divided to bring people into this country or allow them to come into the country and stay who do not speak the language\nWho do not share our culture\nAnd whose first by definition first act on us soil is to break the law\nThat is going to bring us together that has some\nUnifying effect that uh up to this point the most of us have been on aware of that I that that strikes me as very strange that strikes me as very unlikely\n\nBut they've been lying to us about this for a long long time there are many many people who have a vested interest\nIn propagating this lie even further and propping up\nOh Schmidt by the way is not is not done with the big batch of stupid thing that each day very still ... keep playing it\nKellyanne Conway ... today goes on national television and she said well this shooter's motives were because there's an anti religious out of it no man\nThe propaganda industry that shape commands with a vial president that she serves a bet it by ... and Rush Limbaugh\nAnd Breitbart News pastors and judicial watch and all the rest of them have blood on their hands for the insight maps that they have made that have triggered an radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in ... he said\nThe lung and heart religious guys aggressively aggressively stupid and the fact that he was in charge of the McCain presidential campaign at any level tells you really all you need to know but why McCain's campaign was due to he also was the one I think the thought that Sarah Palin at the VP was a great idea a great idea writer who was part of that whole process\nSo but it but to the to the main point here claiming that Breitbart and a rash and a little van and others have blood on their hands is just is just a a a smear\nEach just slanderous it has no basis in any reality especially because the first of all really he's he's going to go out he's going to go after ... after ... after an anti Semitic shooting in a synagogue\nThis complete buffoon on MSNBC speaking about propaganda that's out there he's going to go after ...\n\nWow I mean it showed brazen that there I just can't figure out is she too stupid to know the full scope of what he's saying or is he in fact just that cynical that he doesn't care\nAnd that MSNBC put this on their air and allows us to continue by the way I'm sure there were other segments of the right before right after this about how we need to restore civility in our conversation\nAfter they got this guy yeah the guy got blood on time for a thing the thing about the same to\nStage but with the now with the who\nLook market within doesn't need me to catch his back but I I got to say you know that it's just it's just an outrage somebody was set of them are at war or about rush or any of\nTotal outrage but I Am is NBC is maybe that's why I don't spend as much time on that because MSNBC is almost in terms of stupidity well it's more honest about being a bunch of left is it's really beneath contempt\nUh it it really is that a level where it's not worth analyzing it because you only watch that if you really believe that history does not matter that capitalism is not a good thing that a math\nIs not an essential elements of good policy making ... ... that's the only way you can watch MSNBC and that everybody should climate there were a victim and just fight over who's a bigger victim and that\nThat's a recipe for healthy society that's the basis of the MSNBC watchers mind\nMan\nIt is it has been rough\nWatching all these people just make complete in Brussels with themselves just outrageous stuff and then turn around and want to be taken seriously and other things oh wait wait since we're talking about the dumbest people on TV it let's just throw in one one more\nOne more out there who is a quotes conservative\nOr you know it was coming the laughs favorite all I Do is jump on the right person that is allegedly on the right Jennifer Rubin who ... you know I I just before we before we get to her her little part of this\nOne of my favorite things that I have a red in in a long time was my friend Charles Cooke who's a brilliant writer and I I Wish we saw and heard\nMore from Charles these days I think he's just enjoying life in Florida but I I've always really liked Charles and thought he was very talented or but Charles did this piece that was comparing what Jennifer Rubin writes one year and then writes the next year and it's like a person with schizophrenia fighting with herself in writing all the time\nIt's like this is a really good idea for Israel is a terrible for Israel you know this isn't really good thing for concern of this is talk of her conservative\nOr there's no consistency your principal whatsoever but you're Ruben sure enough sees an opening to trash Trump brandy Semitism she's taken to play Fifteen\nFull that's not something that has presently have high paying that's not to lean on people respond to say that out there talking about his tax plan it out there talking about these fake trained L O L not why take out I found a marathon blaming the bloody shirt and that's why we got our\n... I I you know what guys we hit\nThe ... I don't want you to get frustrated we hit the she used to do it too stupid now we can't we're we're ... I'm ... I'm shutting down for for now because it is too dumb to err on this show that's what I'm going to ban on said I've heard it on the show\n... were were banning I think Reuben is the outer limit producer Mike of what we could put all the air here\nI tried to ban most MSNBC stuff but you know you know but sometimes I Want to buck slap it so you know and I know you do that rights but I but I feel if the sometimes when you buck slap and you feel dirty afterwards 'cause you're like oh I actually\nTouch it you know\nGross MSNBC it's gross\nA meal my um yeah sometimes it goes slap MSNBC around a little bit or are we got we got a big second hour of\nThe show come up so let let's get right to that and uh we will talk about the election them intermittently a few days away an oath so much more awesome efforts their car will be joining al Bundy Johnson cigarette [noise]\nEverything you do online is trash there's tremendous amount of information that people can get from whatever it is you're doing on your computer or your tablet\nOr your smartphone and once the bad guys get their hands on that oh man you're in a world of hurt [noise] I Know about protecting your information and do it off and that's why I express\nThey they pile of hate atop hate and then say that the\nConversation right now is to hateful well you're not going to bring the temperature of the rhetoric down you're not going to lessen the\nOutrage in our discourse by just being more angry more destructive and more hateful than ever that that that's pretty self evident\nMedia has a figure that out they were on the one hand say Trump needs to stop being so political in his speech and then the other said Trump is Trump has blood on his hands and these are media organizations aren't even pundits relieves their whole whole news of its they'll say Trump has blood on his hands because of this or that terrible thing\nBut it gets even worse um I I saw this yesterday and I\nRarely do I have to do I have a wild moment watching\nCNN or MSNBC these is rarely made it happens but I'm sure we used to them smearing the president so used to just ... everything gets raises everything is white nationalist average you know this is at a\nAt a certain level it's also just so boring and repetitive you know they're not even creative anymore and the way that they hate the president it it's just they're all repeating\nEach other and then they're all just trying to outdo each other with the the worst and nasty stuff they can think of to say and this has become a this to become its own little industry who can think of the most outrageously anti Trump thing to say on national TV but I think ... I think we've got a winner\nIn Julie or your father or your coffee who\nI did not know this uh had been fired from Politico for a tweet suggesting that the president commits incest and she was very coarse language not just as the thoughts disgusting but the president commits incest with his own daughter that's that's who\nPolitical head on stuff yeah she got fired ah because I guess even for the live media there are some limits to how protest they can be and still be quote unquote journalists\nBut Jake Tapper owes so famous fake tapper oh so serious tapper\nWho just can't stop chin wagging about how he's the most uh you know down the middle you know\nErnest gums shoe journalist ever oh and oh by the way you know how much you love charity and the troops let them tell you a hundred times a day it's just you know enough Jake we we get it or\nYou know this is a guy though who is ... Ito will get very gets very aggressive with conservatives on a regular basis gets very aggressive with other people around the president calls amount called them for being liars and all this he has the\nOff on a show and does not stop her or challenged her at all when she says the following yesterday play quip one\nYou know that's passed that at one of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on it talking about Islamic rattle radicalization of\nThis president has radicalized sell many more people than I sat right did I mean the way he talks the way the way that is that's just it it it's hot out the way the way I see a allows the way he was ... ...\nYeah that's right presidents radicalized more people than ISIS now now I I Know that there's there's some people who might say hold on a second book you know if you're if you think that being a conservative as radical and they tried to rationalize this in some way but none of what she just did there\nWas to compare the president and therefore his supporters who she says have been radicalized goes so far there's only\nBeen one radical that we know of who's actually been violent who's a Trump supporter one out of sixty three million that voted for Trump never mind those who didn't vote for him I think he's great it was a lot of those do\nYou got one that we know of we don't have people run around in the streets like we do with anti fall in large numbers causing mayhem and the name of Trump you know that's all on the left\nWe don't have anybody who's actually harmed and come very close to assassinate as being a a member of the opposing party as we do with these Steve ... shooter and the Don lemon treated out today that he can't even imagine a Democrat being violent Steve's lease\nRetreated that just with these eyes looking up at the sky like are you kidding me\nDon Lemon multimillionaire newsman image also the Trump is right he's just not don't let me just not very smart and he's very insecure about that because he's just not just not very smart\nBut\nYou know you look at the way that this conversation happens and and and the way that the left\nTries to frame it and you know you off a decides that ... whatever she decided that the way to get attention here and she succeeded in that regard it should just go even crazier than everybody else the Islamic state\nRan a totalitarian caliphate for a few years that in slave millions of people that engaged in massive kidnapping torture and rape operations as a function of of war and policy like they did that systematically\nA murder or at least tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of people if you were to really kind of a mass graves horrific televised torture executions\nAnd she thinks it's she thinks that it's in any way\nRational and reasonable to compare Trump and his radicalized supporters to the Islamic state in in any context now the only defense that I can come up with for free yeah your coffee here and\nShe's indefensible but I mean the only way that you could really try to explain this as well there are so many people on the left that casually compare Trump to Hitler at this point casually compare\nTo you know the third Reich and uh and and ... and say that there's all this this rise of white nationalism and Nazis and that's occurred under Trump mother you know I remember when rock Obama was president and there were all these all these stories from the\nYou know the Southern Poverty Law Center on these other groups all there's this terrible rise of white nationalist groups because of Obama\nAnd nothing happened for eight years in the white nationalist there's like fifty losers no one pays attention to really or just pathetic and want it and want attention you know the white nationalist really equivalent of like the Westboro Baptist church but the media makes it out\nTo be discouraged or coming for us and they're going to take over everything and\nThey're just delusional I mean there are ... well it's not even that the delusional they're they're really cynical because this serves their interest their interest is to make a white nationalist seeing what they are much bigger than they are much more menacing than they are because that's a means of of attacking Trump\n[noise] but yeah you off he came back after that break and said that you know she got a little ... Jake Tapper most him in the break realized just control or mature gotten his ear and said you can't do much cancer that with the President's Day and we're going to keep pretending remember this isn't even on a quote opinion show trapper runs and it's laughable but to ever runs a a straight news\nUh he earlier today Brad par scholar who looks like a a a Brooklyn barber slash arches cocktail maker or you know he talked about the\nPalo Alto mafia and the censorship of conservatives you're talking to this on on CBS this morning these are real things that are happening and it ... it reminds me of how at a place like CBS or NBC back in the day they didn't think they were biased\nAnd that was the really the the main underlying point and Bernie Goldberg would work at CBS for a long time then became more of a Fox News stable in a conservative\nBut you know ... the part of this the liberals didn't understand was that they thought that they were being objective they were so biased as to be in capable of understanding and accepting the degree of biased in their journalism\nWhich is a whole level right it's it's one adult level beyond it's one thing just say I know that I'm actively pushing for one side or the other and I'm making a conscious decision\nAge even more pernicious\nWhen you push for one side and the debate over the other end you don't even realize you're doing it\nAnd like yeah you know I'm just I'm just just the facts you know this is this is Apple's not bananas there was a banana as not apples whatever it is over it and CNN [noise]\nSo I I I Do think this is a the finally this is the time when we understand that we're going to have to find workarounds or at least have greater understanding of what's going on at these places and greater transparency because think about it this way if if a\nSmall I ate really infinitesimal amount of money spent on Facebook ads by ... by some Russian a troll farmers if that can be thought to sway an election what do you think Google and Facebook can do and by the way do entirely legally that's much better than in many ways an entire contribution to one side of the other\nThe answer is they can sway an election [noise]\n\n\n... and electricians most students are referred to college rather than a trade\nThe independent electrical contractors is trying to help fill that gap trying to help young people who want to become electricians to become electricians and trying to help electrical contractors\nThat need to hire for their companies find good people join independent electrical contractors association seven won three eight six nine Nineteen Seventy six I sure hope you\nThis is there some day thirst and host of fifth I heart radio podcast with twenty three and me listening in and I chat with brothers Darren in check Chris of the band computer game and New York times best selling author AJ Jay could about how we are all family like it or not the way that I had to find\nFamily is you know we are surrounded by people in our lives that\nWe consider cousins and close close loved ones that are closer to us and [noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for some members saw\nSome getting twenty five and thirty thousand people to these rallies nobody's ever seen there has never been at this isn't bragging that has never been anything like what's happening I went to Illinois ... ... seven forty said this massive hangar\nThey had to use a second bang for the overflow nobody seen now and always look what happened to Ted Cruz is doing great how we use and he's not doing great\nThat's right it's not bragging these you tell it like it is Margot delicious all over the place how's it looking for the midterms is the Trump effect is going to carry the day is the cabinet wave still assessing\nAnswering these questions and more we have with this now ... Johnson reporter at the Daily Caller Mr Johnson good to have you back\nPay but thank you so much for having yeah so\nDo you think that they're going to be a lot of lives eating Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream or on election night in order to to do all the hurt and and deal with all the tears or they go in the house or how we look in right now\nYes Ben and Jerry's resist ice cream actually comes with a warning label on the back that says it does taste\nBetter if you're crying liberal tears into it and you mix it up and the extra salty and the extra sweet it goes together beautifully\nThat's good and I think there's gonna be a lot of that election night but there are trending\nPolls upward for Republicans nationwide you have a lot of races are particularly after the Kavanaugh the Kavanaugh fact you mentioned earlier a lot of races that work toss up\nA winning right a lot of races that were steady down it's going to cost up\nLot of races that Republicans seem to do and Democrats seem to be able to cling onto his seat that have now ... um massively in that direction of the pie as we were lectures babies over tightening you extra races like Tennessee races\nI'm like in history but it really is trending upward for the ...\nYou think that a Ted Cruz is going to from an electoral perspective kicked a skateboard out from under ... and tell them the Sylvie heavy stuff is loud\n[laughter] there's actually a viral clip from Ted Cruz yesterday Republican on the Daily Caller a where he where he colder where he told a a a reporter who asked him about Texas getting their first Latino senator or what is there a shortage is there a shortage of Irish men and the U.S Senate\nBecause beta of courses are actually Robert Francis over ... years very very Irish and Ted Cruz's halfway between\n... and married to a billionaire by the way how does that not really ever get reported until now I've been reading about this guy for months I just found out that he's married to a billionaire family and tends to with his own financial interests are at stake side with the plutocrats over the people Benny what a shock about based show\nBack what a shock I mean what else have you got to say we're gonna come up this is terrible how could but the millionaires and billionaires promise kept ...\nBlue I didn't know if you were going to count like count Dracula thing there that was burning it first I'm Glad we figured out it was it was Bernie but I Do feel like I Do feel like Bernie or rather\n... ah got got kind of a pass for being incredibly wealthy and so every time I see this guy he's got the rolled up sleeves and he's been described as Kennedy yet and I'm like oh so he's a silver spoon or\nWho's running around with a nickname for the culture that is not his own okay that's interesting\n[noise] yeah well correct at least as these on a skateboard there's less of a chance for him to hit someone while drunk driving in a vehicle and actually hurt them\nAnd then he could still flee the scene on a skateboard my friend don't think that's not possible\n[laughter] either way whatever happens whatever the cops but in the police report it was alive remember that but it was a lie\nThere you go to ... cops always lie about things like that so do you have any races that you're looking at a that you think are\nWhere where you're expecting the Republican to over perform expectations up to this point or you know who do you really let me at best question for you here ... who do you really care about seeing get the W. on election night was only a few days away but I mean who who if you get W by their names you going to say it's a good day for freedom a good day for America\nRight so you have a of course you have Ted Cruz versus beta and what that is just position recorded twenty that was the candidate a liberal journalist right now are writing the beta\nWalk for he actually won right shout out to the journalist right now that are that are already have that piece prepared because they do is down by double digits in Texas or this just isn't going to happen for him also the president of course is who is boxer campaigner and there's really actually\nMoving the needle her a lot of close races the president's going to do a ten day and a campaign stop ... or the next seven days up to election day\nHe has an obligation to try to read us up much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helpful meant that\nThe president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence\nDirectly I got the same so how do you marry the situation with the president last week says he's a national audience daily say white nationalist tobacco he does have to take some responsibility for the pipe for races bio climbing that we find ourselves answer\nPresence opposite race is obviously a demagogue geography condos anytime 'cause I'm stuck so national and say this is all the left\nReally has by the way at the national level for why you should vote for Democrats Trump is so terrible Trump is such an awful person and\nWhat they don't seem to understand is how much that then factors in to the other side beating our sides unwillingness to\nChange any of our tactics they're not trying to convince us\nAre trying to strong arm us into a ...\nPutting trumpeter bending the movement they're not making good arguments they're engaging in moral blackmail why would anybody who's really thinking about the issues and thinking about what affects them and their day to day lives\nWhy would they listen to want to get this they're not even saying hey let's have a bigger European style social welfare state with free college and free healthcare now and as you know there's no such thing as free so it's really\nA ... you know they\nPaid for health care and they paid for college which means you pay for worst question of how much it who\nAnd then let the mayhem of the bureaucracy ah get unleashed in terms of price and and the distribution of care and everything else but did you you're not even hearing them make a real picture about any of this\n... this is where we are the Democrats I think had been anticipating either a bad economy right a ... a downturn economy right before the election or they were anticipating that people would become\nShow beaten down by the anti Trump rhetoric and all this stuff about racism and racist Republicans and they're so terrible on a show of all that stuff they really thought\nThat that would be enough to turn the tables against Trump but they don't understand is by doing that\nThey're actually making the case because there's only some people were going to be persuaded right you're you're never going to you're not going to turn the tables with some ... hat\nWearing Trump early stage true believer many from listening to the show and high five to all of you for seeing a political movement that Ninety five percent of the professional political class\nHad no idea what's happening until basically\nAn editor already occurred on election day\nRight so you guys thought Ninety five percent of the professional political elites did not\nBut you're obviously not going to change your mind based on what they said no matter what no matter what right um because you see the result but I'm Talking about if this is really a function of the persuadable going into this midterm election a few days right we're we're a week away\nFrom finding out who controls the Senate who controls the house that has profound implications for certainly the next two years I'm not I'm not it's not the most important election of our lifetime that is not true okay that'd be ... and it's not what that\nIs twenty twenty gonna be the most important election would probably be the second most important election of my lifetime because I think the most important was twenty six feet so twenty twenty will probably be the second most important I don't think you're ever going to outdo twenty sixteen but you know obviously every election really matters\nAnd and the next two years or that the tone will be set\nIn terms of legislation and what the government's going to do by how this midterm shakes out and that's why I just it gets so noticeable the Democrats aren't even\nAt the at the national level and they're trying to do this thing and every different race will do they're trying to run a good candidate for the district right or a good candidate in that state if it's kind of a purple state so they have these people that are a little centrist on some issues it's like the Joe Manchin affect\nHow was Joe mansion even a Democrat because he likes unions\nI you know you look at it because he's pro worker I mean Trump is pro worker so you know you get some of these people who are Democrats who might as well be Republicans there's a few of those but much more common was on the left or people that are pretending to be\nA more centrist than they will vote to sexually fool the voters and then get in bed with the Democrats later I mean that that's the more common tactic that's much more likely to be or what you see happening and and that's why it's either a local local media market stuff about\nHow protecting protecting preexisting conditions in Obamacare and that's what this is all about but at the national level all you're hearing you get base turnout from a left his trumpet Trump is a racist he's terrible\nAnd you know they're just they're never going to stop\nSo that's why whenever they make it sound like oh if only Trump would if only trouble one what stopped being Trump and you'll like him this is nonsense waste are based on\nA mentioned twenty twenty and how do the second most important election of of my lifetime or I like what Trump is to say about this last night and Laura Ingraham show a place that\nSo far I like 'em all\nI don't see anybody not and should they shut down and\nI like to I'd be very happy with Hillary I like 'em all [laughter] I don't see anybody that I wouldn't enjoy running against\nYou know the truth is that is the truth is nobody right now that Trump looks at\nAcross the island things oh wow I don't know if I can hand I think that person might have the you know the magic formula to beat me oh wow you know I don't know\nThis is nobody there's nobody that's even close\nI the only one who you think maybe it's enough of a wild card that it'll be interesting is Bernie Sanders and I think what people figure out more about the more people know about Bernie Sanders policies at the national level the left they're going to like him so that's a pretty big vulnerability\nBut you know you're pretty close to you talk to me the most but when you find out you're gonna have to pay Seventy percent of your income in taxes I I

Fox News President Trump considering doing away with birthright automatically get citizenship to children born in the last even if the parents came here illegally white\nAnd it's it's really quite frightening\nSarah are you this is a this is a part of the discussion that I think always somehow gets or other pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some on his confusion and the parts\nThose who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic but we always hear that it's the person it's prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic from what you're telling me\nThat it it it's really that these are similar to prescription drugs with there being obtained illegally and being made illegally so ... is is that an accurate ... to what's going on here I mean is it\nIs being made invests in Mexico it's obviously they're not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out visor as if from the picture in or any drug company entirely from this\nAre who are we so we know that there was a problem and we know that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in for a debt tool\nFor dental work there was over prescription of opioids on we saw a rise in that not only with you know veterans but with boat with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing but what what happened was as soon as those\nIssues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in doctors stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this we can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels\nBut China China is also a culprit of this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own pills their own pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da ... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\nThey said look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an ex it looks like his antics that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real Xanax it's not a real Percocet it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking those for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it ends to lives lost but when you see it come talented with the enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure about you you hear about this all the time but setting all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose and die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man\nAnd we've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example in April this year in Nebraska and state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds of that and all and\nAuthority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcased\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcase did in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country\nWhen we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez came and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I closed off this theater right now\nAnd they released a small package affecting all through the air systems we would all be dead he\nSaid so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives realizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids\nWe have to let them know without on the street\nWe have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happened before we lose a generation of our kids and we have to face it and we have to be honest about it [noise]\n[noise] service the documentary tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people would have been affected by this in any respect 'cause it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before\nWhat what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all\nPeople have to find their lane everybody in ... in\nAn all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child as a health care provider it's\nUnderstanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing goes right away so we can save lives and as people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriated the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic that there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the vast array of our of our\nOf our money pet but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this as we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in Dane\nB. E. I. N. not in pain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and that into our people's veins and into our children's bang when we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala was Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nOrganization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives of millions of people and we have to start treating it that way\nWhether that's putting up the wall building the wall\nOr enforcing laws um international laws and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I Can't tell you about how many parents I Know that have no idea\nThat this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that these pills are manufactured in trailers that\nThat our kids are purchasing step\nThat the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical or prescriptions a that what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home that it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nLike the drug cartels in Mexico likes you know lower elementary do all these different cartel the Beltran Leyva and really making sure that the Mexican government understand that we're no longer playing games\nWere going to stop the flow into this nation and of course ah you know we have a lot of issues coming up at the election\nWhether or not to build the wall whether or not to deal with how we're going to deal with Mexico and our southern partners are these are issues that Americans should be actively involved in and put in their own thoughts and their own sense and calling their congressional leaders and saying hey what are you doing about this what can we do about this to help\nSave our country from this ... this potential disaster which is already taking more than a hundred and Fifteen lives a day\nFor working people watch the documentary\nOr would what for people to go to not in vain V.
