about mobs\nHuh what we call angry large groups of people that are threatening and sometimes attacking individuals on the street which we call large groups of people that show up in a concerted effort to intimidate harassed threatened scare and upset people when they're trying to have a meal\nThat's not a mob is no such thing as a mob but then again Democrats ... warns the Cherokee so there's that\n\nWe are entering a very dangerous period here some of these threads that you are seeing now some of these trends toward a radicalized and deeply angry left it's not that all of them are anti

anybody ever try that\nBut no and and I don't think that would be talking to you of ideas that that's a way of getting the message look we're fake news everyone's sake there are so much of this information they put us\nThat's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour but I I really believe I didn't do that Stewart number one I probably wouldn't even\nBe here talking to you like it to not just I Do like it is a form of getting out to say\nThey hate I mean the mainstream media hates that Trump has this personal information fire hose and he can turn on any point in time\nAnd just let it ... they want to be the gatekeepers you see CNN wants to decide does he get an interview or not\nYou know does this person's message get out there were not same at MSNBC ABC all these different networks that they they want to be the ones that get to form the narrative it's a lot harder for the narrative Trump's like no that's not true you guys are liars and tens of millions of people can see it right away\nThat's why they're so upset about this that's why they get so angry and that's why I'll tell you later on I actually got it a little a little tat tat\nWhere they CNN executive today via Twitter who you don't do it takes issue with the fact that I called out that their coverage will be Elizabeth Warren DNA debacle was hysterical and\nHighly partisan and they were trying to at first kinda help or a little bit and then they got annihilated as other big oil just maybe this DNA didn't prove a [laughter] it's just so obvious it's so obvious\nBut they pretend that it's not they pretend that uh\nThe president's the problem you see when he called when he talks about fake news now whenever a journalist anywhere in the world is thrown in prison or as killed by some despotic regime is Trump's fault\nOh isn't that amazing isn't that isn't that cute or\nAll your ears on the do you think that if Trump started saying nice things about the press that they would stop saying that it's just well no of course not because they liked this line they they think this is great it can't be just proven it makes the media feel like a bunch of murders and they are a bunch of cry babies\nAnd sure enough\nNow they have a president who calls them out and make them feel uncomfortable about their lives and they can't handle it and culture who is one of the true grades you know we've had her on the show many many times and she's a great lady and great writer\n... and has done so much for conservatism I I Would argue that and has been the most\nAll of this is not a word that people who are good writers like to use in this way but most impactful conservative author of the last Twenty years I think you can make that argument um and and I should also a great lady I I I just think she was a lot of fun\nAnd she has taken to task I mean there's just such a perfect example of what we're talking about fake news what do we mean might do we have the clip by the way\nUm because okay we're getting a ... show on CNN there's ... I actually just now it's just scary time for that she claims the president said it's a scary time\nFor young white men\nUh she said quote white men have a lot of fear right now according to Trump\nUm that's not\nWhat he said he said it's a scary time for young men in America\nHow did why get inserted into this and putting this out in her column how was it an ... has it very clear quote we've all seen it I've played it on this show President Trump said it's a scary time for young men in this country how does that get turned into\nWhat I mean here's here's here's what the president actor we played played Trump and Trump junior saying it's scary temperament play it\n\nOh I Will come back to where we're about to get it we we have it we just got to find but they what they said is very is very easy to understand it very clear\nAnd they somehow they somehow took this are they somehow took this and made it into an issue of it's a scary time\nFor white men white men have a lot to fear right now um\nAnd you have to ask the question why did that get insured in there why did that all of a sudden turn into an issue of Wyoming here's what the president said play\nThis isn't it was hard when you invite you to see Fleetwood Mac live going on the road when I went to the [noise]\n[noise]\nHave the ... audio see we're going to call that before remember we we played at President Trump's at a scary time for young men in America here's what she said he said but\nPresident Trump signed on June here said this week white men out a lot to fear right now\nI'm Sorry what did that come from ...\nPresident Trump has signed on June ... white man had a lot of fear right now\nI play the audio for you guys did did they say anything about white men\nNope they did not\nSo what do they do here oh that's right they manufactured a pretext to of course get their audience all oh my gosh you know Trump and racism and go for the most sensitive ... political topic they possibly could\n'cause they know that their audience wants to hear that Trump is a racist they know they want to have an opportunity to bash Trump as a racist and it just like everything else you know the initial lie gets goes viral the old sorry we made that up nobody pays any attention\nNobody cares to disgrace it is a disgrace [noise]\nSpeaking of what they're willing to do to stop trauma treasury treasury official has been charged with leaking sensitive bank information to\nA reporter oh that's right\nThen employer treasuries financial crimes enforcement network was arrested and charged with disclosing banks suspicious activity\nReports tied Jew who wants to guess what investigation\nWho wants to get us the Russia investigation what a shock so here's somebody who is a government employee who thought you know what I'll do to try to jam up\nSomebody in Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael\nCohen though there's more than one a and released this information to is believed buzzfeed news and bus be of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happened\nYou're a so quote the criminal complaint against ms Edwards alleged that she leaked materials that led to about a dozen articles\nIn twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen pertaining to among other people in matters Paul Manafort Richard Gates Maria Butina the Russian ambassador in Washington a unit of ... holdings a Russian company entangled any money laundering case\nBuzzfeed reporter who isn't I okay it is a budget isn't identify the charges is Jason Leopold who was listed as an author on all twelve articles cited in the complaint\nSo here's a woman who is taking financial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes\nDid you say is he's a suspicious activity reports this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean the kind of like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential legally\nProtected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this oh yeah yeah so and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means nothing it means the government flags it\nAnd then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve law breaking but here's somebody who forty year old woman\nThought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath\nThat you would violate the law and\nRuined her career and now I now probably her life along with it because it was just as that important to try to get Trump\nDo you remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it explicitly to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone who was leaking classified information\nOr sensitive information about individuals and businesses right this is stuff since then reports for our own on anybody this isn't even intelligence world stuff is there are there can be a suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe a lot of banks sale\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it\nCan do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed by this so you have to wonder how many other federal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press\nTo embarrass the administration members there was a from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that tied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message\nSense it very clear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump you could be the subject of this kind of government activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high levels sensitive access could decide to release information about you too\nI'm not saying it will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it\nAnd it's not just people that have worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing argue to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you'd be willing to incur in order to continue speaking yeah they are waging a form of psychological warfare with\nThese kinds of activities oh just this one oh how about the guy who ... a bunch of ... a Republican members of Congress who worked in the Congress but all their private information out there\nThat's the kind of stuff that makes Senator Rand Paul's wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now this isn't a one off these people are doing this stuff who leaked the conversation between General Flynn and the ambassador from Russia served ...\nWho did\nHaven't found that person yet I think it was a very senior Obama administration holdover I've got some guesses\nHorrific abuse of national security power and the destruction of individuals privacy that's how they play the game they will break the law they will weaponize the government against us\nAnd then we'll turn around and say why are you still I mean when we win because we have superior arguments [noise]\n'cause we're right [noise] and they can cry that could whine about this as much as they want [noise]\nBut we're right [noise] don't ever forget that [noise] I've got some thoughts on the show be\n... a washer those with you and what what ... what's the biggest problem the media dresses your oh that's right it's

Kim Jong on these others and essentially spit in their faces and anything short of that show that he's a coward anything short of that shows that he's a bad guy\nUh you know they're they're not operating in good faith and I think that's really essential\nWe can't lose sight of that they they're not criticizing his predator because they really want to do something differently it's all just an excuse for Trump rage\nHey Trump or that's what this is whether it's foreign policy the economy immigration every criticism of Trump from the left now is infused with this anti Trump rage\nOh you know they are really the cause those anti father should be anti trust anti Trump she'd I did there she was a while while\nI I Am so sick of all the grandstanding on this on this ... issue and I also think that people are really over selling overestimating how much of this is our fault in our problem how much of this is something that we really need to take the lead ... why do they think we're going to

that right now if I were look it up if I could probably look up something you can do it right now I'm On air look it up the Vegas odds are I think that it is yeah\nProbably you probably get at least two to one right now maybe three to one\nThat the Democrats will take the house Senate look I shouldn't say things like good to go 'cause a lot he would yell at me and I know I don't want to dampen any enthusiasm I Want us to make the right choices and go to the polls and vote Republican no question right and and everyone needs especially if you're in a state I mean I'm In DC doesn't really count but especially for those you live in states the matter\nPlease please go to the ... ... it's it's gonna be a small margin or a small margin of victory for either side I Believe in the house and we will have to see what that actually looks like a lot to see you know how how close it gets [noise]\nI'm In ... you know there is a a story out of Texas a that there are in fact there are there has been a a an effort to engage in\nRigging votes and I think people are now facing felony charges a you know there's this Texas vote rigging scheme is getting just a little bit of coverage and you know here it is to women to Texas women arrested on vote fraud charges in Fort Worth\nThey targeted seniors in the city's north side of this from the star telegram so the here's what they were doing the scam allegedly was it they were targeting older voters and they would they would use that we get their mail ballots and then try to have them sign them or they were trying to\nDo this fraud and mail in ballots All right um\nThe complaints on this is what the the article says you're the complaints focused on mail in ballots which allow people to vote from their homes\nWithout any ID or verification of identity a key concern has been how often people may assist others were physically helped by witnessing\nA with filling out the applications for mail in ballots were the ballots themselves supporters have long said melon balloting is crucial for overseas residents in the military and senior citizens critics maintain that such voting is ripe for abuse and raises concerns about vote harvesting in which people could fill out amateur and other people's ballots\nSo here you have these Texas women who were accused of stealing other people's ballots\nFor the Democratic party by the way oh what a shock a Ford signatures ballots cheating all this stuff and it's for Democrats\nSo now people go to prison for voter fraud were always told there is no voter fraud and then I I talk about a case like this and they say oh well okay there's some voter fraud but then why do they say there's no voter\nFraud you know what the thing is they don't know how much voter fraud their aides and they don't want to know\nThirty council voter fraud according to a statement from the Texas attorney general's office okay these are people who are trying to cheat and an election now you could say why would they do that some people are just true believers some people are probably getting paid off to do it but\nAt the end of the day they also believe all along that there's almost no chance that they are going to get caught how do you get caught\nThe Democrats fight any form of verification any form of election integrity and security at every turn and they say oh it's racist it's racist\nAlways that uh always this notion Democrats pushed that\nAny hurdle it in the in ... when I heard all any integrity measure right like can you showing ID when you vote shown I did when he cash a check right he showed ID when you wrote anything like that is specifically to target minorities targets everybody\nIt's generally applicable because of the history of the voting rights act and ah the fact that the Democrats still like to pose as the great heroes of the minority underclass in this country that is their position that is there that is what they do um with all of that yeah they they don't\nWant any election integrity measures and they want to keep protesting there is no voter fraud even when people go to prison for voter fraud [noise]\n\n\nThink of it at ... here in Baltimore member from\nHarvey practical tonight as a software providing for reading your sample ballot and pregnant with a guy you can vote on a life of all\nArmed him I said in your home phone sample\nBallot provide that information from like I'm a county board of elections but\n[noise]\n\nHe's back with you know because when it comes to the fight for so long never saw [noise]\n\nLimited really well and I I look I don't want to make predictions we have great poll numbers we have tremendous turnout at these rallies thousands and thousands of people more than we can hold his enthusiasm like we had\nYou know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening I think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I keep hearing about the enthusiasm to blue wave but I think we have tremendous enthusiast\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough\nHe uh he is I I could tell very optimistic about how is looking for the Republicans going into the midterms you know I think that he's I'm really feeling when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people on the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close it's going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump brought up in that same interview uh think of that same interview that that is really got me\nA concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nosedive and if if if it's\nCyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nOr anything in this country everyone will say oh this guy but there's no [laughter]\nInflation is very low on hey Powell I think I don't want to get laid ...\nIs that that goes to bed is raising rate is just too fast and it's independent so I don't think to them [laughter] but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last inflation numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue\nAnd I say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is a this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around\nWe're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even with the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached this point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough I'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be some rough water and that's a very gentle way I think\nOf saying it as a result of unraveling all this all this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years\nTo keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more indebted now\nThat when we were at the time of the crisis in many ways and you know deeper or deeper in debt and we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt\nAnd we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not I cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore but\nHere's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your cue John and uh all these other groups out there the far left wackos are considered very fringe will you'll notice that\nThe the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um you know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do\nHave a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does and all of its rhetoric but they liked that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as a opposite oppositional and willing to\nTake action about all this and with that uh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis if all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent my interest payments on the debt struck a crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy\nI guess it was one of my calls to mind but somebody else scream is based on quitting I'm Out here a little thing and then when he went home and it was over the weekend he realized oh my gosh what am\nI ... I don't have a job a that was a great job I made a terrible mistake and then he didn't know what to do and thought and falling thought and then he figured out he figured you know what I think he talked to a friend who told him and do this if I remember the story right which I might be missing some of the details\nAnd he just showed up to work on Monday I pretended like nothing had happened and it worked\nEveryone just acted like he was fine and he just you know they maybe they forgot to melt out or just chose to ignore the whole thing but they wanted them there and he showed up at everyone just went about their business no he said there was not even a conversation about it [noise]\nAh so I think that's what it was the one thing she's going to do when it comes running for the presidents I think are approaches hey America let's just pretend that that whole thing\nDidn't happen let's just get past the whole DNA thing and\nI'm Still your progressive heroine right let let's pretend that that's the case show um that's not going to fly\nAnd we heard there from Debbie White delve a poor echo who is a descendant of the real Pocahontas Pocahontas was a real person it's you know John Smith honest although I gotta say John I think that the Pocahontas animated Disney film is one of the weaker ones\nNot not good can you seeing with all the colors of the mountain I don't even know what that means right and that was not particularly in June you get the idea you know what I'm Talking about some of the some of the young ones and they're like yeah I liked the Pocahontas but yeah it's fun I mean the best is\nIt actually you know I Know people are going to get married for this one I think you gotta figure the best animated Disney movie\nIt's tie for me between a Latin in Lion King I mean their their neck in neck I think those are those are two of the best I'm also very partial to beauty and the beast of oh no it's a little more for has to be a little more for the ladies\nBut it's very well done with the first animated film ever nominate for Oscar okay back and focus back to a descendant of the real Pocahontas\nSo you have it ah what what you saw here was that\nThe left has this whole framework of something they call cultural appropriation right the last has this framework where they will say\nUm you are not allowed to make the cuisine of another of another culture yeah you're not allowed to wear the uh the garb of another culture\nAnd cultural appropriation let me just say is a stupid concept because all culture borrows and steals and it influenced by other cultures all the time\nIn fact if you were to look back at what we consider to be western fashion a lot of the most well known western fashions today come from other parts of the world are ... are from fabrics that we're only possible because of colonialism and I mean there's there's a lotta stuff\nSome of you were like oh you mean like Muslim city of Mosul for example a ... you know getting a pattern from Malaysia getting I mean you think of as a very wide speed\nNorthern northeastern American kind of a thing but no uh comes from Malaysia ah Sears sucker comes from India you've heard me talk about that before so\nCold culture is always changing and shifting and we should celebrate anything that's good at any culture right is this notion that people have a a particular claim on a culture strikes me as odd to begin with but if you're going to be policing appropriation\nThen for somebody who is as white as Elizabeth Warren\nTo claim that she was a Native American specifically for the benefits they're all but also\nReally to to to have some kind of an identity to make her a more interesting person which I think was all part of this I mean she wrote in she was a fake Cherokee who wrote into a cookbook called powwow chow\nAnd stole a recipe from my real French chef\nAnd called it a charity recipe so it's a fake charity stealing from a French chef to make a fake Cherokee recipe\nWow\nThat is this is the person who wants to be an expert in the United states by the way\nYou know there are a lot of personal failings there are a lot of things that I think I you know you could point you in any number of people and say you know that\nI could have made that mistake you know\nThere's there's there's certain things that you can feel a little bit of a personal understanding of it and say you know what that person may be crossed the line with that or that went bad but I can understand how it got there I can understand what the circumstances were that led to it a being that way\nI'm pretending or Native American for many many years is not one of them are\nAnd and I played that story for yesterday where she talked about her mom and how her mom was dealing with the sting of racism because of her Cherokee family really\nTheir parents were or you know the\nParents involved here were worried about the grandparents I guess for Elizabeth Warren\nAbout a maybe eighth ninth tenth generation back Native American\nAncestor that's a that's pretty crazy that's pretty well but\nCultural appropriation was always destined to collapse under its own stupidity and the moment that it is politically advantageous to less will try it out once again the most oh no you can't do that you can't wear that kind of costume oh about ... I saw this stupid\nHulu all these platforms are just overrun by lives can we get some normal people involved oh\nHave something about this Halloween you don't wear costume that's offensive twenty culture or a culture ancestry or whatever okay so now that means you know no costumes or somebody dressed as a Native American garbage can dress up as Pocahontas you can dress up as any of the foreign Disney Princess is\nA ... and I just wonder you know what but if you're if you're a non white then under liberal rules do you have the right to dress up as anything that's not as any person or you know any entity that non white for uh\nHalloween then so is it really just white people that are allowed to dress up in and cultural gar that's not\nYou know I guess I could wear a Viking ... I mean I could wear a Viking thing\nBut\nI don't know I don't know what the rules are and here's what offer you I don't think the left knows what the rules are either I mean I think that they\nIn general just make it up as they go along and this is just a power trip it's all a power trip of political correctness started out as a means of trying to rebalance power for what they thought were a under represented in discriminated minorities but with time political correctness is just turn into a weapon\nFor those who want to use those groups\nAnd I'm Talking about white liberals now for their own purposes right to use those groups for their own power so close to appropriation as stupid term but bottom line of years that if what Elizabeth Warren did is not cultural appropriation [noise]\nThere is no such thing he does not exist even for [noise]\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home titled fraught with the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nMaybe that's the really the plant that's what they think that's where the aid of the Democrat Party is right now and I I Believe\nThat is true you know Nancy Pelosi who is just such a such a Charlotte in you know what is Nancy Pelosi sample she's this incredibly rich courtesy of her husband are disconnected from normal people self involved political power broker that's what she really is\nHelping people care about people care is one that people do see\nWhat do you think about it or what what can you point you oh or or great achievement was ramming through Obamacare that's that's fantastic talked to somebody who has to deal with Obamacare now or lost their health care plan and tell them how great Nancy Pelosi is I think you'll you'll hear some four letter words\nThis is now where it where it's all gone this is this is the reality of trying to deal with them um and by the way ... essentially endorsing this anything goes at any cost attitude play Thirteen\nAnyway they\n[noise] I\nHave to believe that the way\nYou see she's saying and this is part of the disconnect you have from the left she saying on the one hand do you have to do to win big right\nDo whatever you got to do I mean that that's really what follows these views on this do whatever you got to do I just don't let the Republicans way\nAnd then the same time she's saying but I refused to let the Republicans you know she she goes from\nAnything goes just wind power to oh I'm so outraged that how how rough the Republicans play this game this reminds me of what we saw after Kavanaugh after the Kavanaugh travesty that was televised for the whole nation is the after all that\nThe Democrats didn't take a step back and say you know maybe we shouldn't have been psychopathic about this maybe we shouldn't have tried\nTo enrich your lipstick fashion torture man on TV in front of his wife and children tens of millions of Americans were watching because we just really want a Supreme Court justice there that agrees with us ideologically that's all it was wasn't about women wasn't about sexual assault that was all part of\nThe smear campaign\nThat was the plan all along it was about power it was about a Supreme Court seat but their take away from that\nWasn't okay hold on a second maybe we shouldn't have gone quite so dirty maybe we shouldn't have taken it to such extreme lengths and engage in such reprehensible behavior know they came with the Republicans were playing so mean\nThe Republicans were so mean the editor in chief of political\nWrote an editorial he says you know I guess the gloves have to come off though if that's the gloves on meaning Kavanaugh and what they did the gloves off I'm Sorry I mean goes off after what they did a cabinet could only mean violence and and widespread civil disobedience and and writing in the streets I mean there's just\nThere's nothing else you know the ... if you're going to take it to the level of because remember they didn't just want to destroy capital ... they were talking about trying to trying to dredge up criminal charges against him oh there's no statute of limitations in Maryland oh there should be a criminal investigation all she she maybe go to the police\nThey wanted him in prison they wanted to use the state to lock up Kevin on not just stop him from the Supreme Court they would do anything as long as it was going to destroy\nAnd they thought that wasn't enough they thought that was playing by gentlemen Lee rules\nHow do you have a conversation with people like that how do you have a discussion with people who take that approach ... the answer is I I don't know what they call you can do you stay true to yourself stay strong and when\nI'm now seeing the wisdom of Donald Trump\nTelling us all that we're going to win so much we're going to get tired of winning we need you the alternative is putting people in positions of power who cannot be trusted with it who do not act with decency who do not acted in good faith do not care about the law\nAnd what's ... perhaps most disturbing both they don't even recognize those things anymore they're so ruthless\nThey don't even understand that they are ruthless it's a terrifying thought\nThere's a lot of social media activity out there but you know that all the stories of piled up over time and there is bias at work\nWhat if we could have a platform where you know that you're not going to have to deal with censorship and you don't have to worry about conversational health or social justice or political correctness or any of that other stuff getting in the way when we got one now folks Snoopy dot com\nMaybe dot com is an up and coming social media site that's just gotten started and it's a place

[noise]\n[noise]\nAgency in sexual decision making he's this\nVery murky area where you know if two people are drunk and they consent to intercourse but then later the woman decides that she did not think that that was a good idea or you know it's always the guy's fault meanwhile if it's about alcohol and that's what dealt with the consent wouldn't the female be equally libel\nOh now we're going to get an who's more drunk and you know we're lines drawn here at what point is consent could set\nThe left I Would note for a while was pushing for the idea of having digital contracts before you could have sexual intercourse essentially woman would have to initially your smartphone this Israel they talk about this\nThis is\nReally a psychological problem that much of the country is happening and this this left wing radical feminism is so corrosive and so destructive and so nasty and yet anti mail it against ...\nIt's not just about women it's not about women's empowerment is not about equality under the law each about finding ways to unleash the anger that this subset of women have against men\n\nAnd then you have a case like this where they've admitted there is evidence they lied they they tried to ruin a young man's life by the way he'll have those psychological scars for decades to come being falsely accused of sexual assault twice when you did nothing because girls didn't like you and thought it would be amusing\nBut there's no there's no charges against them oh 'cause why oh that's right 'cause they're victims but wait they lied so they're not victims how Garry you women have a right to be believed but these women admit that they should not have been bullied so what are we to make of that\nRational response to this would be to say oh\nMaybe what the left promotes years toxic maybe it's destructive maybe nobody should buy into this notion of a left just being believed\nBut we haven't yet gotten there as a society we still have these elements that push this notion that there are different standards of evidence and different\nJustice expected for men and for women and\nThat shouldn't be the case and the people who are pushing this nonsense are really doing a disservice to this entire country [noise]\nUm and that their their ideas are in defensively [noise] unfair and stupid but they become shrill and nasty and hysterical over it and the less sees that as a political when [noise] so they allow innocent people even to get destroyed [noise]\n\nHe's holding the line for America bucks back then is that\nBoy mainstream media is getting a little upset at Mr buck given given Mr\nBuck a little bit of a hard time or or what do I do oh happy learned how to part\nUh so the headline on media today CNN executive trade barbs with X CNN commentator I don't think of myself as an ex CNN commentator technically that's true but you know just there for a little bit low but your shoveling stuff\nAlthough they didn't say stuff to score cheap points obviously this uh the person writing this media to live so he wanted to go with a big line from the CNN so a senior CNN executive is throwing down with box section is according to media I'd a former political commentator for the network Africa conservative pundit criticized the network's coverage of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry\nThe ... began after the right wing host of the hill TV posted a critique of CNN is reporting on warns attempt to prove or Native American heritage orange claim has been a source of criticism for years this week she opened herself to scrutiny a again since or DNA test results they her Native American ancestry ... only one in one thousand and twenty four\nSo here's what I wrote folks um\nIt's a good thing CNN wasn't blatantly complicit in the massive on forced air ward pulled yesterday that would've been really embarrassing oh wait a minute\nAnd I had below that Elizabeth Warren this is the CNN politics headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of native and Native American ancestry no strong evidence is in quotes\nBut that's ... that's hysterical right I mean this would be like this will be like running with a headline that says you know for somebody that was caught on video you know that that that is and it's already confessed the murder be like a man accused of murder not guilty in quotes\nAnd they'd be like well it's that that's what his lawyer said okay but\nIs that you're making an analytic judgment by pulling that out in the strong evidence ... it's not strong it's garbage is not strong evidence knowing that strong evidence they would never do this if it were Republican all anyway so this year the attention of CNN vice president of communications\nAll Matt ... never heard of this part of my life who defended the network's coverage while accusing section of not actually reading the piece I read the piece but thanks that that's cute anyway\nMatt wrote to me see how strong evidence is in quotes that means it's a phrase attributed to someone other than the author it's almost like you didn't read the article or watch our coverage oh wait a\nOkay Matt well I did read the article and I did see your coverage could see it in his honor the news room where I work all day long so yes I saw lots of lots of see it as coverage and it was a appalling me stupid\nThough there is that uh the media outlets unfamiliar to fight to get an earth bucks actually respond through ...\nHa ha sure dude CNN coverage of war is DNA release was really top notch journalism and your headline wasn't clearly constructed to put a positive spin on a disastrous decision by likely Democrat twenty twenty candidate just own you're biased\nAnd he writes give me a break you didn't watch or read our coverage you're just shoveling S H on Twitter to score cheap points here six more headlines from CNN\nAnd the DNA chess I don't care if you criticize why's he but I have no time for trash books actually goes back\nThat's funny you're leaving out this gym of analysis by a reporter a quote reporter who wrote in this piece Donald Trump never cared about Elizabeth Warren's DNA\nWeight but that's a reporter she's doing analysis though oh you mean opinion but no they called analysis but oh she's a reporter\nSo what's the difference there was no difference there just playing games and then I wrote to him CNN tried to run covered Warren and then got caught looking dumb your coverage than adjusted out of self preservation it's fine to be a DNC appendage just own it\nYup yup yup yup yup yup yup that was fun\nJust take your spanking CNN just take your spanking\nAnd just go home All right John don't try out after you got your little spanking and be like show me you show me\nA good times good times she CNN is in fact often fake news and it is definitely part of the news and if they really want to try to have this fight and they want to know all also noticed with a guy goes to ... this is what a quotas I'm smarter than you more on do you think I don't know what a quotas\nAnyway\nGood times good times made it up a media today plug slap we need to sound buck slap slap books\nLike [noise] these facts you roll calls up next week so [noise]", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "18"}
