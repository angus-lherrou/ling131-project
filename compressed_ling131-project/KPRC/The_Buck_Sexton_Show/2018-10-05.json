N. J. not can we do for the people today\nI'm all set up a little straighter and proud or when you say stuff less has bought a a really are and if it wasn't for are notorious levels of humility ... we might pat ourselves on the back they just want to say she was proud\nWalton then Johnson shall\nWe say warnings five thirty to follow the or see nine fifty [noise]\n\nI gotta have something nicer but uh eh you throw it in a Ruben there was some uh cheese and some sauerkraut and some uh ... ... a Russian dressing like you love\nHow do we know that is Russia ... is that hold it gets very similar to a thousand island there's a serious Russia yeah how do we know\nI always suspected or used to eat at a place called ... what I mean he used to and uh well it's\nCloser id die you're just I still would want to if ... if it's handy or a cause they got sandwiches bigger than your head or they do yeah you can't eat the whole no you can't ... I mean you order one cat on not just telling me bring you the takeout box with the sandwich\nA lot of the people the white white Christian and waiters and stuff that work there they have to go through special training to build up muscles just to carry the sandwiches yeah\nMy my daughter and that was her first job was working she caters to the mall to carry those same which he was a hostess yeah they have to stick or at the front of that was the reason why she couldn't carry the load to the table she thin little limbs averse would Trimble under the way it takes us dirty check with big powerful arms to bring the food\nTo the table but anyway uh I often accused Kenny\nOf using thousand island dressing on the same old he would swear that it was I said Kenny this taste July of thousand island dressing you crossed a line or if I go in the back I'll bet you find a big craft\nA thousand island dressing in there that you're using a the sandwiches are and you know what kind of like this this whole a convict the judge thing\nHe wouldn't let me into back you'll look oh well that's all you needed to another guy imagine that they got oh I don't get to go look OK boom no new study out from the University of Oxford in England where they know so many things\nAnd I know you're not going to agree with it is you you workaholic you while the jobs in show to dedicated to work I Know there's like a yule so I said if we all had three day weekends we would all be happier and more productive and our jobs\nThe recommendation is from Oxford that three day weekends\nAnd four day work weeks would mean we would actually work harder\nAnd be more productive on the base we work I don't trust the communist to tell me anything we'd rather work more but they hold us back they restrict is kind of just how much work they'll let us do around here I mean I really love work I just I mean the harder the better\nWhen you go to the possibility of experimenting with this give me an example\nOpen minded is all I'm saying what if we were to take a day you know soon ... about two days and then and then come back when we took to the you know like Monday\nAnd see how much more productive we can be next week I think that's a good idea even thinking about it now it's making me want to be more productive at this moment yeah I think it's a good idea we should or possibly at least try not that we want to but if it's good for\nOur fellow man then we will sacrifice for the good of all I'm like you\nI look around every day and I say what does my fellow man neat yeah you do [laughter] times I'll leave this office building where we work and I'll I'll stop and pause\nAnd they got what the hell's wrong with this guy was the dominant pausing and looking around I'm looking around and see what my fellow man needs a survey and\nThen of course I get in the car slam the door put my glasses on and get home as quickly as possible but ... of course I check and usually uh it's just been kind of the current state of things that my fellow man doesn't mean anything that looks like they're good you know what I'm home going to get a sandwich take a nap\nBattle ... looks like he's taking care of well good to know that I check you define yes that's right that's the most important always check with other men\nNeed what can I Do ... ... ... sometimes it's nothing but yet check and that's the key [laughter] it's kind of like I'm\nBeing one of those blue guys in a avatar\nOh not in the blue man group that I I I Want to be some blue man group make a like a special appearance in the next avatar movie and wouldn't that be fun\nBut they'd be very small cars the blues guys are huge and regular blue man group or just regular size guy yeah I think cameras could work it out though he's pretty good those blue devils as they call them a can just lift you up by your head and pinch it like a temple is just huge\nYou notice did not an avatar movie\nWhen they would shoot the bow and arrow at ya the bow and arrow look normal size to them yeah ... when the arrow would hit somebody for ... the size of a ... year it was that the the metro generally are the guys differentiate and mail it in that they absolutely you don't want that\nIt's like when that guy's girlfriend you know the the blue girl with the tail all that tail wellness who played that a Saldana going yeah anyway we so yeah\nShe uh when when it was just him and he wasn't in his blue blue man suit you a little Biddy things you can carry him around like adult like rag doll and and I\nAlways wonder what you did with the tail she'd wonder ... none of my business I Know what I'd do it [laughter] don't don't sully a perfectly good family motion picture with your craziness is that\nHas been pointed out to us the genius of judge Brett Kavanaugh you explained it to me I guess somebody explained it to you and it never dawned on me just how smart he was as a as a high school kid he even was able to figure this thing out really\nIt was ahead of it even in high school as a teenager Brett Kavanaugh\nOnly chose to molest all true liberal women connected with George Soros how did he know even back then I guess it's like this uh six cents or something he got\nThey didn't even know they were ultra liberal women yeah now the handle is already they've never even met during jobs yet and yet somehow Brett Kavanaugh new\nOnly molest ultra liberal men and women that who you should play with and he he got they\nCan even accomplish something like that we should vote that guy and for that sense of awareness alone pretty impressive it's a\nIt's huge wow and how about this one get a feel for thing that's the sound is a great idea Dr Warren minimum in fast as I\nWrote in something called the L G B. T. Q. nation that a true veteran speaks out stands up and advocates for social justice\nHe says\nThat the category veteran like right now we consider a veteran as the guy that has served in the armed forces and fought for America I'm In the military or whatever branch you happen to ... well we should also consider those fighting the cultural and figured if war\nTo reduce violence in injustice they should be considered justice much a veteran as a Marine Corps guy or a\nArmy why why so she'll justice warriors oh my God are according to the veterans uh you got to be getting me yeah\nNow he's serious we've got that uh Joe Joe is a retired Marine corps a bomb\nTechnician Hurt Locker said a Monday\nThat the argument is pretty stupid and laughable Jones lost both his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan\nWell there's probably a social justice warrior out there who lost a cell phone and a little windy still doesn't know where that cell phone yesterday man I got pretty rough out there and the bark he said you know the term veteran is something that's\nSmall but it's big and meaning and sediment\nIt's something we choose to do as a country it's not something some individual chooses to do that or they're weird sense of something or other or not they just when you think that the mentally insane liberals couldn't come up with something more insane her\nAnd didn't sound right to me that takes stupid they doubled down on ... ... they just they come up with stuff you couldn't even think of if you if they told you are among give you till tomorrow\nAnd I want you to come up with the stupidest thing you can think of a deal could not come up with this one and you can make it as stupid as you want oh yeah it's been two huge stupid for these people know bull never would have\nCome up with that one yet right gotta tell you that sets up beyond me please stay with us but it's more stupid\n... [laughter] good on the clock is the fact that your audience far primarily stone slackers\n\n[laughter]\nHealth and\nOf the capital mistake he made trying to get all spring go I mean he could be like the king of the Senate\n[laughter] he picked the wrong to say [laughter] ...\nHe got drunk and a ... not only do molested unexploded a woman I now have you did it all at the same time ... now that's that's pretty pretty big ... if you want to do stuff like that do it in Congress not in court\nYou ever think about doing radio picking the lowest form of life from Johnson [noise]\nYou know run on the\nYou know roll my own cigarettes because those are Marlboros I get my pack and I\nA survey that law now\n\nYeah [noise] ... [noise]\nMainly 'cause you smoked a ...\nThat's what I call my cows\nThe whole or cattle called ... [noise]\nNot me a cough and those cows that cough anywhere\nGuy that won the with the way that sounded hokey\nThey did a a remake of that years later with\nA cute little yeah Ann Rimes but now that\nThese are the way to go that route or do you like right there I mean\nIt does good to read these emails from ... read news emails from people usually well it's good\nTo see that first there's people out there like you that share your opinions about the show we love the folk tale that sometimes you hear differing opinions and stuff well sometimes by reading an email from somebody like that guy whose sister was back in town and\nHaving a birthday and we wouldn't tell her how it lead to other people know the rules\nSay you can't just always be on here telling the rules but sometimes you know the rural seat Ben a by content yeah like Susan emailed us and she learned something today she says a deal on all the great things that are Amy's brother said about your while to go in that email\nWithout you all I could never get myself up and down I thirty five in central Texas you know so she got us banging away every morning on a K rock one on one seven temple glee Waco belt in hiding ... and all the other\nCities or around that area it she didn't name I just know the area anyway she says I Know it's against the rules\nI heard you say you can't wish me a happy birthday to date either Susan a\nSo I'll just keep telling everybody\nIs wise up and listen to a lot of jobs and go get help get walk up and you got to get what we got\nI think everybody knows the rules now and we're not to be ... when I go\nSo these sneaking birthday wishes in love getting inside a woman say a little bit there it's very nice just to stand another minute let's go a little deeper\nAnd now it's time for another episode of one minute inside a woman's head while you know hot topics have gone on a new level when there was a sign\nIn the break room that says no debate please\nI guess I understand what their insinuating but does this mean I Can't bring the dropping of the word ... from Duncan [noise] what about Real Housewives of New York and I bring that I came back any are taken care of\nThe debate in probably divide the entire off at I mean how did they see is just getting so I don't know who's going to get the other day who they take turns hating each other every season I bring it up and it might stirred debate and that in my mind Sawyer ban me from the break room\nThey don't even have the machine in here anymore\nSomeone keeps steering ... not a fan and I know like ...\nYeah right like I said I'm not white\nTrash telling me I learned and that was another episode of one minute inside a woman by the\nWay I can you Bethany [noise]\nThe year ... in front of a man's\nWinds my dog staring at me like that she's staring at me I Wonder if he's thinking why do you keep staring at me keep staring at me\n[laughter] dogs and\nFact that maybe\nThe dog up says they have your cell phone out yeah turns out dogs get depressed when you use your cell phone too much I don't know that your friends your significant other your family your co workers your kids you think about all those when you're using your cell phone how you're cheating then at a time\nAnd you know wearing them for some inanimate object that it's not like it's like crack in your hand when are you are you getting the feeling that this crosses species now the dog even field and told\nThe new study says dog actually get depressed when they see on your cell phone recharged ... your dog picks up on the fact that you're totally ignoring them when you're on the cell\nPhone and that makes that makes you eventually all of that anxiety leads to depression and the study found the cat\nDoesn't love it either when you're on the cell phone grew the cat since they're less social than dogs and they don't really give a damn what you think of them they take it a little less when the heavy heart\nSo really if your cat had a phone\nIt would totally use it as a way to ignore you also it would pay you back with his many cell phones or something you got on your phone he cheated on his own agenda joke Castro and out you just say well I'm On the phone to\nFeel like the dogs are like that dogs are the ... the dogs are your you know they love you no matter what the dog is stares\nAt you because they want you to do something chances are already there want you to let it outside but I Want you to feed it\nBecause you've been staring at your phone you forgot to feed butter on feeding is always good that's always been a dog it was tearing it you're saying basically the ... even if you want that side he'll take food yeah that or outside or\nWant you to interact with him in some way play through all through the ... uh ask me who is a good boy lumped into my Chesapeake retriever it's\nMall suck ball inside a science ah yeah because uh she uh regular ball doesn't keep entertain but if you put a tennis ball in an old sock\n... that fucking last all she'll destroy that sock in a day but if you've got some old socks are and you put that that tennis ball and socket and then it becomes\nLike a weapon like a like a nun Chuck or a bowl of she well actually swing around she's learned to wield it knocks stuff off with and use it as like a swinging club\nCatchy also hurt herself was it if she shakes sitting out there and destruction like a nun Chuck it'll flip around and he yourself as a top dogs but yeah they love that stuff they will whip that thing around like crazy\nJust got to be careful you'll get your I put out watch yourself ... emailed us a picture from the Trump rally last night he was in Tennessee\nOverflow crowd\nHuge the pictures taken from way\nBack here Trump's a little bitty thing a crash whatever reports this how huge he when he goes this was shocking because it's not in the news surprising to anybody that wasn't in Tennessee at this event but there's just thousands and thousands of people are outside of this arena or something that he's at\nAnd it's just a huge swelling crowd and you know this kind of thing just drives the liberals in St Louis has already and say now that I wanted to make some crazier\nThere was a guy they interview this morning it was at that rally last night he's a Vietnam War veteran and older fella\nAnd he said I didn't vote for Trump yeah I'll be honest with you or I didn't vote at all\nBecause my dad was one of the other guys that were running against drop one of the other Republicans and so I didn't vote at all used to but I'm Sorry I didn't know because he went and saw ... last night and he said man I got chill bumps he said something about if you've never seen Trump in person you get it when you see him in person and he just connect with\nPeople he's got an aura around him and is this something people about Bill Clinton that no matter what you thought of Bill Clinton when you're like when you're in the room with him and you're overwhelmed by his personality I ... the same\nWas true with Reagan and remember a lot of people now they look back on the Reagan you think he was universally beloved\nThey hated Reagan when he first even Republicans when he first started running they hated it they weren't too wild about him when he was an office Democrats ... not quite nobody hate on the level they hate Trump but they didn't like Reagan\nConstantly made jokes about and fall asleep being too old and that his wife was really in charge ...\nCat explicitly\nJohnson\nWon the rock and then by the wind\nSo here's the thing I talked to seems owner and he's agreed to start paying us fifty per se share a false prophet served from this gay would you like that and that would be great glad you said that

WNBA this franchise has never really made any money sorry\nHis face so I like the way that you found out\nJay ...\n[laughter] ... [laughter] for\nA two man\nGave the RCs fifty [noise]\n\nTo see who won't ... [laughter] it's like\nA we're adopting a little bit of a every once in a while a little bit of a foreign accent to show that exotic flavor this was a show is that a recommendation from uh some there's some\nGuy or the console console getting probably ought to be a little more exotic [laughter] about that that I mean like an exotic dancer\nThat's too bad well more exotic so I'll start to look up in a whole number ...\n... ... back to the day they used to say well may be unable to your show\nWas exotic yeah it's not true not not now no no the times has been a change you guys were ever are now you're all over the place we we all wear Black Panther and did all that forever you know ... ... ...\nGo on to a baby or whatever it was a you wander forever ... well don't worry about me in a day we got to Laurie yeah uh me and who\nYou are as I think that gee isn't that what it used to be ... or ... or ...\nI ... that don't call me ... that anyone named Omar ... like to weigh pull daddy and be do you use the changes ... or ... or ... Italy I liked it better that whatever was up again now I'll keep up with all this\nKind of a little trouble down there at the uh he was the musical gassed on Saturday\nNight Live and uh\nNow they might not care for him much in New York City will with him coming out of being a Trump ... elated ya ya I'm not sure how serious he is about the I think it helps you get a lot of attention and publicity you know the caller\nSaturday Night live live but it's not necessarily live everywhere\nIt's only live in New York at the time they do it then\nLater it's ... for the rest of the country and this that and the other\nHand there's the tape delay because they do say some nasty stuff right and so\nThey took out he did to musical performances as the musical guest they took out one of the musical performances and he did it he said they you know they they record it and he performed it for the crowd ... body had\nA symbol of hate\nOn the whole time he did it do but like a swastika that's what I saw when I first heard it so ... to ...\nMake an already to allow NATO ... yeah ... ... make America great that is so it's a hateful terms or want to make\nAmerica great\nThey well they need to do\n[laughter]\nGetting new ideas I'm just saying okay this is yeah now\nSuperman ball and it's amazing to me what to do\nBy the way you know my hair cut\nTo be out on an ... which are they going to hang up and I don't think it's actually that helps [laughter]\nAnd I don't think it's helpful what you do it [laughter]\nHe didn't perform it to you know go head to play the song here yeah yeah we don't have to\nPlay though I mean it is sort of like he's starting to make a little bit of sense about the media going\nOrdered him to tell you when you don't want to ruin the bag I guess the producers ordered him to take his head off and\nYou say none of my contract I bet you get to tell me what kind of had to wait and what about choosing their though you took me by my shoes so he performed they he didn't have the hat on I guess for the first performance second when he did and that's the one they did not air\nAnd they said they made some lame excuses\nAbout had nothing to do with the had it was more it was a time consideration are going to do a more skits with such and such and coral or she did and uh nothing to do in the ... the hat was not the reason for the\nThey lie just like they do about this stupid woman you know we got to really be nice this woman you can't be little the victim and the more we find out about this woman it's time to get a little ... did they get ... this woman lied this woman is a ...\nOperator or she's not some and she's not some horribly wounded a bird everybody treats like a ten year old or a nine year old she's like fifty something you're so she talked with a little girl and she's a victim and she's so bright she's on her she's a political paid actor\nIn liar the hell was through all of that\nYou know the politicians know that you know the media knows that but they're not telling you how the regular folks out America the ones that just don't\nSeem to have a clue how they don't see this is beyond me there's a blindness a foot isn't there that tell you it just embarrassing that we live in a country that is made up of about\nHalf of a bunch of ... one of the things I always say is a everything they do including\nThe set up for this woman victim and her whole terrible ordeal is a a comment that they think you're stupid\nBut the reason they think you're stupid is that so many of you are [laughter] not all of the of course probably the ones that we see this show is stupid at all but so many are that it just makes them think\nThey're ... well I guess they're followers they're stupid so they think everybody student so no I don't think it's stupid we thank you of the smartest\nRadio listeners in the world that's regions are up with a show\nNow where do you go when when the world needs answers to problems
