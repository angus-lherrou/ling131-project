[laughter]\n... says you know when they go low\nWe [laughter]\nThey go low we can\n\nYou know that's a pretty accurate description of where the Democrat Party is right now they kick us they're okay with that\nAnd we don't have to go low by the going alone now means demanding due process\nGoing lo means the presumption of innocence to Democrats going lo means not sitting there complacent Lee while yes a mob of lunatics senators and with actual mobs outside decides to skewer\nYou in front of your wife your children the entire American viewing population by claiming that you are a secret gang rape is from your teenage years and nobody figured it out until right before you're going to be a Supreme Court nominee only idiots can't believe this\nOr people who have been brainwashed people who have been so thoroughly propagandize\nToo that they can't find any weight or reason through these things\nThey really think that Trump is a threat to the republic they really think that Republicans want to uh set up concentration camps on the border for people that aren't from this country but these this is the kind of rhetoric that they keep using and we say OK okay this must be\nVicious must just be the Democrats trying to fire up the base trying to get people enthusiastic about politics on their side\nMaybe we really just need to take them at their word maybe they actually do believe this stuff or at least enough of them believe it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues\nTo being dangerous one thing to say the Democrats are ignorant of history and refused to admit or allow evidence contrary to their closely held belief is another thing to say that\nYou can't even have a conversation with them any more about this they're living in an alternate reality and they're aggressive and they're angry and they're being encouraged by their most prominent members to take this out on you\nI I've been asked the question is I said what do you do when someone says oh you're a Republican you must be an opposite the answer is not oh try to convince them you're not a Nazi the answers get away from them\nWe are now entering a phase in political discourse where for reasons of self preservation and safety I Would tell you\nDon't engage with these people don't don't talk to them and probably 'cause you just don't know you just don't know it's definitely going to be ugly or going to say terrible things do you ever you can handle\nThe harsh words I Know but\nIt's a very small margin of error between someone getting up in your face because they don't like your politics and screaming at you in front of your wife or your husband or whomever\nAnd all of a sudden a scuffle breaks out and now there's real violence and not only has to happen once before then the temperature gets raised even more and now the next time people square off in some kind of a public dispute over politics\nThe impulse to become violent is even more apparent right the impulse to take this to a level of\nHitting people attacking kicking people and perhaps even worse do not forget that the Democrats\nPushed the lies of the black lives matter movement and there were many many lies I heard them I can tell you what they are among them that there was an epidemic of killing of young black men by racist cops who have their their for whom there's no accountability that's a lie\nA but among among the many lies that were told to this day as well it didn't lead to any violence that the anti corporate or did not lead to violence alert there five dead officers from Dallas texas Texas\nA who clearly their families their departments their friends would disagree with that notion very strongly as well as ... instances of other violence against cops cross gotta chew killed sitting at a patrol car here in New York City where I'm currently doing this show\nLeft wing rhetoric has led to violence including lethal violence where's the correlate we we hear so much we're that CNN anchor talking about Charlottesville and we will continue to hear about a casualty at Charlottesville\nWhenever this conversation about political violence but\nHe's holding the line for America bug sex and is that\nI'm waiting for liberals and you know intellectually honest liberals to admit that when you have a raft Ted Cruz in a restaurant that is also mop like behavior why is it that I'm willing to concede that Donald Trump is a bad person and that that's my behavior but I never hear liberals come on or ...\nI don't want to say I am not to say that that kind of behavior following senators or any other elected official into a restaurant and now with their family I don't agree with that I did not bury their ...\nDon't know I I I Know you've got something that shows that there were or as much as\nWe saw okay I've got to get to the break we'll answer your question the U.S or is it my behavior no it's not my rights but people who are angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy either will not\nBefore you jump in okay\nHe's just supposed to sit there you see and get pummeled\nHe's a he's a never Trump conservative or never Trump Republican or whatever and his job he look I I Know because they wanted me to play the role and I wouldn't blame his job is just sit there and just get smacked around by I think there were four lips on that CNN panel including the host for lips and won't do\nThat as a lab valid they that\nHe's totally correct I mean I I give him credit for at least we want to say it on CNN but they act like it's now it's a question of the number one it may not be ... what do you mean it's I'm up when you've got a big that's when you've got more than three people who are together screaming\nIn your face and acting like maniacs because they're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like her politics don't like her political party that's getting into my behavior when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThat it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nAbout using that were there very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lips to feel like anyone sending me about the really devoted lives\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise Andy fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who\nDon't necessarily agree with ... methods but they agree with the message\nThey know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem on the left ear and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it reminds me so very much of what was being or what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys don't I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these\nIncidents the most probably well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri\nThey're these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind\nAnd they were burning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analyst later on doing what well is mostly peaceful protest it was mostly peaceful protests\n... emotionally peaceful protest well what is it even made\nIt can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire and they were like oh my gosh look the country has been in turmoil look at the rioters\nAnd yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of the black lives matter movement\nThen all of a sudden you know they're they're not ... you can't afford them as writers you certainly wouldn't refer to what was going on even though it was about race and racial animation claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\nBut that is what it would have been called decades before and if you were to look at what was happening yes a lot of times riots or follow on to demonstrations usually people have to get together first before they can be a big mob is destroying things you could always have this\nOn a cable news show when when keep in mind there is a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who was a sports caster\nAnd she said something about about boobs on he said that he you know I forget what it was exactly but he made some reference to the female organ that is\nCalled by some uh boobs and\nIt was a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see another excuse me so it looks like when does it it was a big\nProblem but then you out what just happened there where there's obviously very racially inflammatory language being used in and people\nLaughing and and mocking Tanya west to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour and people have all these very strong opinions on him\nBut I I think that there was a long crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time if they're grasping for reasons are grasping for for ways to justify a their intolerance of other ideas\nThe the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies either we we have so few celebrities on the right that speak\nOr soap operas alright period and we've so few people that come out and and a spouse conservative principles that with someone of ... a level in celebrity land says anything about\nBeing pro Trump H there's this mob yes there is that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately it's one thing that they want to say who cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm you look every idiot\nCelebrity I Know we talked about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney I mean name one Tim Robbins and Susan surrender these these people were\nAll just absolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin and it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a ... ... all of them are on this one side and then you add and\nAll the music artist you know this is always a big joke with whenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist and the world and the Trump recording artists were\nI don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually the different artists I don't know\nUh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq them up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country and things that I still remember up there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone who's your favorite country artist John I'd ... I'd have to go with I don't know Garth Brooks just because usually when I think of off the top of my head no no she Tommy is Garth Brooks no come on anyway\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and Kanye is out there and he said people are what are you talking about muggy I look I Adam Baldwin Nick Searcy\nA James Woods used Twitter account is awesome I mean there's there are some conservatives out there for sure but we have worn high level music act like this\nAnd really more of a cult it look he's more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big cognac fan or isn't gay or you see John the recall and with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right\nYeah that's right I work I mean technically I work for her media so I feel like I Need to know more about the music industry lingo show\nBut but they're they're piling on him and why was because they resent any loss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber effect of love when it comes to any cultural\nA music Hollywood figure ... they they cannot abide if they cannot deal with it and I mean I Can't deal with them like they cannot psychologically process it it\nConcerns them at worries them they don't they don't know what they would do that or how they would handle it if they didn't have all the celebrities\nThat they know what I'm saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all the stuff people really really do need to get it need to get a grip and uh\nThat's that's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this by the way\nUm I Would just note that the\n... years or for a moment we have a some others but so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we hold out of here here's what we've got on this so far\nThe biggest concern is if everybody that are the people they just chose not to evacuate I I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a horrible\nHorrible store a hundred and fifty miles an hour a disease twelve inches of rain this but the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge whether the ... thing or fourteen feet it's all deadly\nAnd I'm very concerned that people are not taking that into consideration so we are ready to respond we can't help anybody have chose not to evacuate ah they have to hunker down and take care of themselves or we have nice ten thousands of people that are\nAlready free physicians that get the power back on but I Am scared to death to people that chose not to go back in fact this is they just say her when a storm and\nThat's the Governor Scott and Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thought suppressed everybody's affected I Know we've got a lot of great listeners a lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody\nEveryone down in in the state is is going to be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a kind of snuck up on people writing because of the hurricane before this there was a lot of oh this is going to be\nA huge and we I mean I remember seeing it way out in the Atlantic I'm like that you know is that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am I mistaken him that notion\nYeah no this one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right I mean it's coming up to a point where they're not used to seeing it like Clearwater Beach Naples like that area I haven't\nSeen it usually somebody usually from the Atlantic yeah right in the ... the east coast of the four oh well\nI Hope everyone is All right I I'm surprised I'm hearing that there's been a lot of lot of people decided not to evacuated\nAnd we we just like I said also preserving but what are more coming up here in a second on the continued fought from Kavanaugh\nLeft is still just [noise] living in this fantasy land of of they're going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing [noise]\nUm but I have a solution for everybody I have a way I think the shutdown that tall [noise] not just going to complain about them complaining about capital I'm gonna tell you how we can get them to shut up about Cavanaugh\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud\nWith retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere is called home title fraud\nIn a simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this thief would've taken out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals were have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host titled the instant they detect sinister activity their own at helping to shut it down your hopes title may already be compromise you know sign up and get a free title scan and report\nIt was a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title locked dot com [noise]\nFeel a threat I leave ... Fox News hurricane Michael downgraded to a category one storm last Wednesday to eighty five miles per hour the storm came ashore this morning as a category four in the Florida Panhandle rather\nA different attorney general a different department of justice looking at it let's see how that goes there is nothing that stops the deejay from doing that there is nothing to stop them from doing it\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith there really aren't any limits on it\nReally ... there aren't any limits on an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the right to be the investigation\nIn fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on it and bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial making all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F ... style can serve I used to be the mind up you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that he that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related uh Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the da da da da da de la ... who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the what the deal Jay determination is about Hillary's emails this time around ... no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that match a mess speaking the FBI by the way\nYou know Rand Paul who's had a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president\nYou've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years so you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning the given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these prophecies work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nIn remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party this this all happened after we should

I like the libertarian not they're not lives there libertarians\nAre they're interesting that politically they're annoying because in some states they'll run a candidate\nWho will be the difference maker between the Republican getting elected and not and then they always go you know but you know we've got to shake things up and no I just wish you I just kind of wish you wouldn't cause these problems literature as much as as much as I Love you love the libertarians but sometimes you get in the way a little bit\nOf there's this piece in reason about uh about a woman\nWho had a consensual or a consensual I guess called hook up right they were in college and then later on changed her mind and then brought charges under title nine\nAnd guess what even with a ... this is essentially retroactive withdrawal of consent\nAfter the fact oh actually I didn't really consent even though at the time I did consent and under title nine and he's kangaroo courts that are set up yes what are they found him you know he was he was in some way punished as you've found liable for this\nUh you finally had to some people coming out and ... for example that there must be a standard\nIf there is not a standard this will be abused and there has to be evidence and this has to be running in the first lady herself in an interview we have that uh no we don't have that All right well burn up the first lady yourself given a ... she said you have to present evidence if you're going to make these accusations\nUSA Today published a piece\nNow I was going to say today but it was actually a dare dare go I think\nQuote I Am a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it\nAnd the er the sub heading here is I'm thankful I cannot condemn the man without evidence I was assaulted fourteen years ago due process the due process laws that protect him also protect me right this is this is where are you really get down to it you either believe that there are laws in process he is in place for all people or you don't\nIt doesn't get it doesn't shift based on whether you think somebody is a victim or they've been traumatized you know in terms of whether there is a process or not\nIf you have no process just because you like one person or don't like another or because of the specific circumstances are there then you're just you're making this into\nDueling accusations and allegations with no real way of sorting it out and justice will not be served if there is if there is no process\n[noise]\nBut they didn't want justice that's why a Kamala Harris and saying oh you know the thing was limited scope what we're gonna have an unlimited in scope background check you know theoretically you could have a background check that goes on forever\nIs that what that is what they want they want her background check that goes on and to the Senate takes or the Democrats like the Senate that's that's when he generation of the background check would be acceptable anything up to that anything that does not take them\nOver the over the finish line of Democrats control the Senate would be an insufficient background check that would be unacceptable\nThey're having a that's [noise] that's\nI think the ... that's all we really need to know about their assessment of how this all out is always\nThe FBI Director [noise] I don't know how I don't know how we hold back his contempt for some of these senators are just playing games but I guess everybody knows her [noise] [noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the fight for so long never saw [noise]\nAn\nOp ed in it or on an op ed Trump's op ed confirms that this is the Washington Post the central issue of twenty Eighteen\nIs health care I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms in just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question force over Roy is with us now\nIs the president forty foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over great to have him\nA buck so ah ... first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house and the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I look at it pretty closely at that particular question I haven't seen any polling data suggest that health care right now is motive motivating\nPeople to turn out ah for November having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not ... they just take the house um and even if they don't somehow whatever at\nThe midterms are going to be over you know the fuck your listeners know this was seen as the midterms are are literally within ... hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge truck and what that primary is going to be all about it all going to be about\nWho is gonna outfitters who who's going to be the truth purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is she's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election where is the left positioning itself where Democrats positioned themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on health care\n[noise] you know one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked\nAbout this on ... in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending\nMore money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit\nWhich aims to overturn Obamacare the out by attacking with a pre existing conditions provision vomit and so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm going to call Republicans racist for something that's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle\nAs the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember\nFrom when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by Warner Brawley who went on to lose in court a defamation case they settled this she than\nA centrally refuse to pay and it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to wander Brawley a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she\nUh she lost so you can imagine\nWhen you hear today from people saying oh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out\nBut let's say focus for a moment on this stop and frisk point because Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was it earlier and we mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey won't claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today\nDemocrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member remember when he says you those those uh those speeches\nAbout the snow and then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like yo soy Mayor Bloomberg God Bless that and you all you know you do as little Bloomberg Espanol ... I I\nThat was great that was great those are simpler times producer Mike\nMayor Bloomberg would slip into his\nHundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know that uh you know the snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you know that was only a scene the Blasio common\nI Know we we didn't know what we had you see the Blasio are read by the way he says the mayor of New York city in case anybody a needs to be told that\nA major city he had somebody ... was talking about housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out like oh you mean to work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\n'cause you like that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess for our we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lot of stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd you know that that is when somebody comes up to them and the gym is a public official\nHe gets all Snoopy about it he says he's is nippy just a few minutes anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on a reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nA large number of these stop and frisk the hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you have a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist\nInteresting when you actually crunch the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped last\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it's you know it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York\nIn a crime and it continued downward trajectory on crime but\nIs that reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in\nIn the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like it was already happening in the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think it's very fair to make on this is a conservative along did say to get rid of stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAnd the ACLU types and all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about to stop and frisk and Chicago nobody has any ideas for how to make Chicago a\nLess crime ridden place I mean that's the number of shootings people think of fake ... and I look that obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's on where you get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot at a low it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbed in any given year\nThat's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lips and I get to talk to them when they\nCome on on the hill TV show all year from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school at come out and this isn't serious\nBut they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that you know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we all the studies\nShow that the the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood\nStatistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household\nThe crime rate is essentially the same across all ah all all cultures and all ethnic backgrounds\nSo you can have the structural conversation about why this violence and places like Chicago or you can't talk about more aggressive policing and say that's raises\nAnd at the end of day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do good or is there protecting\nThe civil rights of minorities but you're just getting out of having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton he's running around and demagogue ing well this sharp as what he does struggling runs around and and demagogues and things but that\nThat he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from anyone in the media just goes to show you that some of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away\nYou know liberals would prefer to call Republicans racist and Sharpton to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was that there was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in\nYou know a numbers ... numbers based policing a calm stat\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling in shrieking over that too but then they realize oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen for Chicago\nI Hope they managed to get this violent situation under control that are not going to hold my breath because Democrats are in charge [noise]\nGlobal verification network is the answer to all your background investigation and vetting needs they're the only dual certified veteran owned

history that their history of finances all of that is on the up and up\nThat's where global verification network feeds show invaluable to you all their employees are located throughout the United states no data or client information\nIt's trying to convince people the mainstream media is trying to convince people that the Kavanaugh effect isn't real that Republicans aren't as United aren't a rallying to each other side on this issue it as they actually are\nThe ideas to suppress turnout among Republicans oh no there's not going to be there is not going to be a backlash because of the Salem witch trial that the Senate Democrats put on for capital there's not going to be on or don't expect anything for that\nNot gonna make any difference at all meanwhile if you look at what's going on right now with the\nWith the house but the Senate you have seven Senate toss up seats in play right now it's\nYou know leans forty right now it's forty nine GOP forty four damn based on the based on the polls oh that's that's where that's well sorry that's where it is and based on the polling they think that it will probably go\nWith the G O P actually taking the are taking this at so that's a good thing that's good news in the house it's\nThirty to toss ups according to the real clear politics average here thirty to toss ups which means that the Republicans are going to have to\nBuck the trends I Know ... uh in order to in an off year in a a mid year ... mid term cycle as a party in power manage to hold onto their majorities will see governors races by the way geo piece looking pretty good there too\nSo despite all the things you hear it right now I I think that we should just remember not only does history show us that this stuff can be wrong\nI must say will be ... I don't believe anybody can predict the future as you know I'm very consistent with that I think that you can you can have some fun\nWith your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever forget your losers producer Mike it's like the secret of being a stockbroker just got to make sure you focus on your winters meant if you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody about all your winters\nVery successful stockbroker and wonder members of losers they don't pay enough attention so\nIn politics than the there's got to make you make a few bold predictions you get one or two of them right and all of a sudden you are\nThe sheer of all things political or the fact that by the way you get\nThe Senate race in New Jersey with Menendez the fact that that's even competitive I Know it's Jersey and I know you're a Jersey resident producer Mike I Know you're you're you're a you're a sophisticated Jersey fellow by the way John we like to make beer do eat the my beard is good you guys got a real got some real facial hair\nGoing on now everybody loves it except the parents what is it with parents not like you know what it is you're their little their little my you know you're always little Mike yeah so you know they they think of you as being the same thing with me my parents don't like facial hair I mean either\nSend my parents' picture last night I was out some friends in the Senate pictures you know shown where I was and get their responses went from one for that [laughter]\nThey're both like what's with the beard what's going on my mom's like I said I'll send you a raise or how they are\nYeah but this is the stuff that I'm getting column is in the office I'm keeping it and the leaders and the officer all fence and they think the beer\nThat can be very very distinguished but you know it's a generational thing two beers or in right now if you go back to the seventies and everybody had the uh the the airline pilots stash while\nAirline pilots they'll keep this stash never got an answer to this though whenever they have some kind of an airline related incident and all of a sudden you get these former pilots on TV they they all have the stash Kelly ... is the only stash yeah they've all got to solve these stash which you know hey look they pull it off I I give them credit for it but are this generation right\nNow with people that are thirties forties lot lot of beers lot facial hair a lot of tattoos also\nI remember when you add tattoos if you were a biker or a sailor and now everybody's got that too I just came back from Vegas you can't you go down by the pool and it's like a tattoo symposium or for for 'em or what I mean it's it's like a museum of tattoos when you're out there everywhere and all over the place\nTo look I mean I'm fine with it I'm just I don't have any I don't know\nNine out of ten of people that I've talked to a pet to regret at least one of them or something about it I always get that view\nUm no I get ... everyone I Know that ... is is pretty much all they don't really yeah I I don't know any ... unless they've got the full ... leave them run on roads and painful\nYeah there you go\nMike and they're going to take the are they going to hold the house what do you think Republicans I gotta\nAbsolutely and when I like it absolutely you're that you hear that producer John ... as you know buck is to shape public opinion yes and in a way off and as we get\nCloser it gets more realistic so the pollsters don't look like fools\nAnd they're going to win the same thing over as was two years ago\nI I certainly hope so because if nothing else just dealing with the liberal reaction to having Trump with a majority in the house and the Senate and going for that's going to be amazing\nWhat ... what do they tell themselves what do they tell themselves then but what do they say\nIf Trump has been president for two years and he and his party stays in power\nMaybe the lips have some a spleen into do\nYou ever find yourself when sitting at the weak taste of coffee from one of those left leaning corporate brands you probably thought I Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased training bathroom policy and other stuff that defies common sense\nAnd more time on coffee that's why you need black rifle coffee I drink black rifle every day in fact I've got my entire crew at the hill T.

as it is so bad enough social use easy breezy first time caller Leo [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nForget that a little while ago I wrote a story\nAbout how woman tried to bring an emotional support peacock\nOn an airplane with her and I thought you know as crazy as that is at least give her points for creativity because you yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane too big not off like a lot of leg room\nBut could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with you yes you could\nPeople are starting to crack down on this and and I've got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it\nThere was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida or just a few days ago and she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support\nSquirrel and sure enough\nThey had a problem with that because there is a policy that frontier airlines does not allow rodents aboard flight so they they are and she wrote inch at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nA but I've got to say if you're trying to expand your horizons for what could be\nA ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subways did you hear in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying to carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think a score it would be in the same category so that she does a part of me John it's like hey\nMaybe she's got a really close bond with this coral maybe the squirrel\nIs very meaningful to her and you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel but then there's the other side of me that had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John it was supposed to take off as one hour flight\nFrom Las Vegas to San Diego and it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning to you know when that flight actually took off seven pm at night almost eight twelve hour delay for not for weather weather as weather right that's that's a\nThat's got deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues and I can tell you that I lose patience very quickly when I'm In that airport lab and not lounge airport area you know the little chairs they set up at all face each other it's kind of creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else people tend not to be staring at them but you're staring at them\nAnd they don't want you to I was ... you don't want to lose your temper uh but what can you do there's not much you can do show on the one hand I feel like emotional support squirrel I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like\nIf I were there and I was told that somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat but I Would feel I find out one way or the other that squirrel that that emotional support squirrel would probably be toast and I'm going to get all the hate bill from Peter now but\nWe eat we eat out all kinds of animals you know I eat\nObviously cow and pig pigs are smart I've actually hung out with pet pigs before micro pigs that are kind of a fun thing ... why do we draw the line John at squirrels why do we discriminate against emotional support squirrels\nBut we think that cat somehow or the superior species I don't have an answer for you the\nTruth is you give me the choice between the pets growing pet cat I don't know squirrels much more portable uh\nThey are good at hoarding their own food you know they buried a little acorns and stuff there there's a lot to recommend squirrels anyway have you know the emotional support animal scam is looks like it's coming to an end I have friends who have gone through the whole process of getting a little vest for their dog\n'cause you get an emotional support best or that's what it says a service dog\nAnd you have to be allowed in everywhere with service dog because of people who have\nReal issues that the service dog is addressing now there's been a little bit of a of an explosion of people that say that whatever the dog like they have a service Chihuahua and they put a little vest on it and I will say\nService dog when really they just mean it serves there need to have their pooch with them at all times that's not really what they're going for service dogs\nSo emotional support squirrel held this thing up for a couple of hours people were obviously very upset about it they did it scored her off this this plane", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year":
