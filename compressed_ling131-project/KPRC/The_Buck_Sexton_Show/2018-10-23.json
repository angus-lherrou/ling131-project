have got to hear this guy hurt on Fox News yesterday on America's news headquarters Chris do we have that clip of this guy man who's good just sit back and enjoy\nPresident Trump has another week of rallies on Jackie heads to Houston, Texas tomorrow to campaign for Ted Cruz despite better or ... third quarter fundraising up thirty eight million dollars to cruises twelve million\nAnd you can see there is a real clear politics here's shows cruise leading in the race right there by about\nEight point what's bringing our talk radio panel from New Hampshire Arnie Harrison and down in South Houston Jesse Kelly nice to see both of you a Jesse explained this discrepancy between cruise fund raising and the average uh in the polls down their\nCruises gr the fundraising numbers or ... or high because they don't have to be high on cruise doesn't have to raise another dime to win this race\nBut it was running for Senate in Texas I've been telling everybody this per month but it was running for president in twenty twenty he's taken a public anti gun impeached Trump's stance in a state where Trump won by nine points Beto this whole thing has been a gigantic scam but he's doing what Democrats are great at nist wasting money\nArnie Arnesen a is that a fair assessment that better really isn't running with it\nI had read the Houston Chronicle the Houston Chronicle endorsed a Ted Cruz in twenty twenty\nAnd twenty Eighteen they didn't endorse Ted Cruz and they embrace tobacco and there is an embrace that all the exact opposite they say Ted Cruz has always been learning about Ted Cruz take us as always wanting\nTo run for president there has been to every county in Texas and they don't care about Texas they don't know what the issues you know this is going to be a referendum on Trump and twenty Eighteen there's no question Trump is driving the conversation what they do is doing if he's driving the solution and that's how Kennedy would every every whether it's train whatever\nThey bring up an important point in in places that the president is either underwater or very close on favorable unfavorable does he help when he comes into these markets\nThat helps huge because the president is love him or hate him as a superstar he's got Seventy five\nThousand people signed up wanting to come to this rally on Monday there's not a single Democrat on earth to get get Seventy five thousand people to any kind of a rally and they have nobody to thank for that but themselves they probably weren't going to gain seats in the midterms but then they drug habit all through the ... and now their party has the likeability ...\nFall he was President Obama that killed mile high stadium in Denver back in two thousand eight but neither here nor there this is a nationwide poll is when you do is we kind of having the conversation extremely interest\nAnd the twenty Eighteen elections the latest Fox News poll shows that Clinton voters in the last cycle certainly are more enthusiastic by about a six point margin\nThan Trump voters war ten point margin I should say why do you think that is yeah see if the president is such a star power and doing so well\nBecause it's a term of a president's first term don't get me wrong I thought Democrats were going to win back safe in the house until the Kavanaugh show trial but once again the Democrats can't get out of their own way there earlier but general Jesse these numbers in post Kavanaugh\nWhereabouts aren't out these numbers because the last generic pulling the six or six toss up rates have Republicans up one this is what Democrats do they take victory and they snatch defeat from it Hillary Clinton could have beat Donald Trump if she if she didn't have all the correct way of a vampire bats\nAre already ... hold on let me just ask let me just ask a question of how you you've got now a pretty significant lead eleven points in terms of extremely interesting how did Democrats not screw that up and the next sixteen days\nTalking about the issue was talking about the issue is talking about the issues we don't have to talk about Trump Trump that's on the conversation himself he's out

[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nWe just said is one to replace the ice and put it inside the department of justice and organization that I Would at least have if I get to the law what were you\nHonor requests from Donald Trump sites agency if they provided the pain or requests were you honored as governor or you work with Donald Trump yesterday I received their time\nThey won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when somebody is five and I'm probably older I've worked with law enforcement when they're in the system they're convicted that maybe they serve ten years but it comes time to come out there's a painter requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that's the only two options\nAndrew will not answer the question that failed her me let me would be willing to release centered anymore like\nMe and said he won't answer the question that was Gillum\nAnd dissent is a dissent is was the one who's pushing them on that issue\nBoth candidates for ah ah for the governor of Florida and and trying\nTo you know trying to get that last push here as we get very close and people are going to look at Florida they're going to say\nThere is a bellwether state this tells you a lot about the direction of the country for the midterm election they're going to say that this is you know really uh depends if the Democrats win it if you and wins who is the uh mayor of Tallahassee\nAnother person who I don't think they're going to run him and twenty twenty but they see him in a young a charismatic Obama ask mole so a lot of Democrats very excited about about Gillum\nAnd you know it was a ... a socialist I mean he's pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer and he wants to raise taxes will be will say that your last ... papers a bunch of things and you know we'll find some ways\nBut just that this was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained request and noticed have Gillum would not answer because what this really is is a question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do notch\nAnd now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered you or do not on her\nEyes to attain regrets what that means is when someone is already in custody of law enforcement and immigrations and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody day Sunday detain request if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse century city jurisdictions refused to do that and what descent just knows and\nHe had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sandwiches including sometimes for violent crimes and\nLocal jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats jurisdictions will not honor these chain of requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested\nUh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it help they will be stonewall we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nRight and people realized that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true that even local crimes can get tangled up and the federal Web\nAnd so there are ... and just the FBI's viewed as a legitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the almighty the intelligence division I would sit in a city with seeded with pardon me a sit in with\nAn FBI agents DEA ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies were all singing to gather because stuffed them come on my radar would also be on their radar and we worked together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular but we understand that there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is causing problems for the law and multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWould give him is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous he won't say it\nBut dissent is was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from a lap and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nParty if not what it tells us about the possibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board smiling at corruption Democrats tried to save Bob and then does months after his bipartisan as admonished bitch\nA Kim great to have you back\nAnd it's great to be here are out what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well as you said you know what's notable here is that well the entire media has felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look at how Ted Cruz is is that not like pulling away from it all worked\nThere isn't races even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where the Democrat Bob Menendez wet you mentioned um he was censored by his colleague rather modest it by his colleagues back earlier this year\nI'm after she had been found to live accepted also get from a man who is now convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud down the government an all time\nI'm not only was he accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of this guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry that department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court\nThat change the standard um on what it would take to convict him but he was honest and he's now facing a very tough race against ... and the Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it's it's really driving a favor\nHow'd you say there is a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I I hear this people will be the all the time and I say okay well what is it and then there's this has nothing there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump meanwhile Menendez who\nWhether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy who was associated with even grosser and they're just open the bushes got launched with the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi this summer actually handed out to her members a toolkit\nA talking point how they supposedly go after Republican corruption chomping and all sorts of other issues none of which as you said there was any real evidence for\nBut in the meantime they just close their eyes of the in some cases actually or outright helping I mean look the Democrat that's why I called the called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majorities superPAC helping Senate Democrats decided to reroute three million dollars help Bob Menendez in his race on night they're taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to defend seats on them places where Trump won\nI'm ... so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption have get their adult trail of evidence that very clear in fact the senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving and one of them is on this\nOr is on the notion of corruption which as you pointed out is is a talking point against Republicans but do you have so many Democrats you start to think of it all the Democrats that have gone to prison and just in the last oh four or five years for\nIncredibly obvious and very shady corruption and that never gets brought up in in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump\nMost you know someone starts telling me about the ... that tends to be what I hear about a but also on on the notion of mobs I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the\nOf the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal land\nBut most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy look it's absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have civil society we have to face it so that we don't have mob rule\nJust because your site when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nThere is absolutely nothing written in any of that formal or informal rules of our society they give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm this is the fact precisely why he has a ballot box and elections and anybody who's out there whether it's on CNN I've seen a couple on there and well I Am not a ma and be they're just saying what they think\nWe all know that's not true I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street is not and if that's the best it got and conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy marriage\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make her production and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have less you're Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans or Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which is one hearing what mainstream yet is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can already saying with complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent a they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down to five feet one way or the other right on whoever does win and going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns and also her book the intimidation game Kim always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\n... back\nYeah I I think he was spot on there with the it's gonna be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously but we're not going to know who controls the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around ... there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till I don't know maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which just goes to tell you you know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America\nAnd now they're praying and hoping that they can not have a blue wave but a little blue reports a little bit\nIt's crazy right now you got the left freaking out chases people at a restaurant screaming at little old ladies and\nThat shows up at a Trump rally ... you've got all kinds of nonsense going on about these post Kavanaugh rage from all the different progressive how about we all just\nAll that crap and drink some delicious coffee how about that for an idea because that's where I Do every day I drink whack rifle coffee every morning I drink at all on black because it was delicious high quality small batch roast or a coffee I've made\nOr we can give a diplomatic statement about it we can say this was terrible you should never have done this\nBut we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone ah this was a crime committed on Turkish soil so we don't have any jurisdiction here to speak up it was also done in a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this is a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lotta people focus in on that but\nHe's still not a citizen ah he held foreign citizenship show you know why is this the president's situation primarily to handle you know why is it something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action\nAnd we do we\nKnow the answer the answer is that it's because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and all this other stuff uh and he loves dictators here's Obama's former\nPublic relations propaganda czar from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be play clip five\nWhat we're seeing here Chris is is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist and said we call them the enemy is enemy of the state and we're giving a green light not just to the Saudi regime\nBut to any regime around the world who wants to harm dissident harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that is sort of Romanoff phony a family\nAnd their families seem to be locked together Geron yes it is [laughter] yeah yeah and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... ... ...\nOh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't want anyone listening to that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management MSNBC I don't know why people listen to a really don't know among one of the worst analysts on TV or a total of leave it used to be a conservative and say whatever you have to say to try and be relevant at any point in time\nBut you you have there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the show the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people\nUh I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where journalists are the enemy of the people straight up is the north Korean\nMinistry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes is North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people whether the ... yes same thing is true in Iran thing that's true in a lot of countries just being a journalist did not give you some moral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling\nJournalists around me here in Washington D. C. and they really think that there's a national they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nAnd this is she always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the pathway anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this\nWhole conspiracy theory about pushing her and Mohammed bin ... where they could get cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get you ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis in a meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on her despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who was babbling literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStopped making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do it they don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them and they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as it happened to him but the way they're talking about him it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile as anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean in American conservative Lebanon attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less\nOutrage about this just the fact it is just the if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered and but there is a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the coast Yogi was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he was an Islamist ... nobody he wouldn't\nDo not as if he were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean it should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double and his clothing after they'd kill them\nTo try to create footage of leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to or they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left and that they had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear him that was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of entail\nAgency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain you\nThe regime's security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are their primary concern is ride regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion\nMost countries are worried about toppling from from the inside um and\nThey get very adept to dealing with that threat but they also often operate in places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis\nThe Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be so ... turkey and that may have been miscalculation here they thought that they could get away with this and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there's also a very by the way ... intelligence apparatus apparatus\nThat is at work so a lot of intrigue here we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms and they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what\nThe big ones out there are making editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on a regular basis you know this you heard about the shadow ban and you've heard about the D. platform ing\nHow about we start our own social media platform where there's none of that stuff about bias no conversational health nothing like that at all Snoopy dot com is an S. N. I. P. P. Y. dot com\nIs for his ... he was just one example of this I mean here's a reporter was supposed to be interviewing Beto O'Rourke and this is what she says to him during the interview play quip not\nObvious strategies that I've seen employed in a in a modern campaign to show off everywhere all the time for every one you can get along without interruption in from the ... much I Love you too thank you well you\nKnow it's just so many [laughter]\n\nDon't rock star you may think ... that's a reporter got the Mike and and the whole thing you know star really\nThat's what you say to the the guy that disease your interview subject now like I Know people were saying oh you're so great but does anyone has any reporter ... from the big mainstream journalist outfits out there has anyone on the left\nOr or even in the main the quote mainstream media is down the middle journalist the big lie but they still clinging to it have they ever gone to somewhere with Trump from like wow you're you're a political phenomenon the likes of which this country has probably never seen\n'em does anyone ever say that did they say he's a rock storming Trump's if they do it was a rock star Trump is a some kind of super human superstar right but they would never do that and I'm not saying that they should I just want to know the comparison between the two because when you take a look at it you can find very obviously that\nYou know they they buy into this mythology runs got beta everyone says by the way you know always show handsome you so charismatic I I don't see it at all I don't ... none of it I like the guy is okay looking and you know it sounds okay and as the whole savings strikes me as kind of funny but I I guess\nThere's a and a myth a kind of\nMixing here and their minds of that\nRunning a person from a red state as a down home Democrat who can speak to the whole country and but also has that kind of youth and coups charisma thing that Obama had\nSo it's almost like the best of Bill Clinton the best of Obama politically speaking pulled together um and\nI think that is how they view which uh I think that's kind of the way that cause they're obsessed with\nThis guy and I'll tell you this and I've seen some other saying and I think it's true\nThey know he's going to lose going to lose by double digits off until he's a lose by by nine or ten points they think he's going to run for president\nThat's I think there's a lot of good enough showing in Texas the case will be they'll win all the blue states and be competitive in the red\nStates and he can take on Trump and I'm here to tell you that Trump fluids [noise] crush him so vast\nHis baritone day Thursday and and I am so excited to tell you about this and I heart radio podcast where I sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives in the world around I don't feel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me and the very beginning\nThat you are part of a revolution can make family family's life [noise]\n\n\nAnd that was you know because when it comes to the fight for self saw never saw [noise]\n\nFood seriously seriously what it is not\nNice cool I'm a prince ... princess we were gonna you know we must around with the parties so we're just picking up where we left off [laughter] let's see she went to it now she told me earlier she wants to be from the pie from the piece that yeah that's me the prince the pie I'm the pie here the sprints fight\nTo generate a contractor something snow but I mean did you ask her if she wants to [noise] Mm [noise] well [noise] I guess not really\nOkay in case you didn't know that is a\nKind of public service announcement from Amnesty International which is an organization that apparently has a lot of time on its hands and Amnesty International thinks that people need to be told via fairy tale\nThat there should be no uh no kissing women who are asleep\nThis guy also this this it's a cartoon we played the audio for him and he kind of like reaches like he's going to do a little group group thing a while this woman's passed out and you know this follows last week when you had Christian Bale who is a celebrity a talent or does not strike me as very bright\nShouldn't have a fine actors I guess I don't know she kind of plays at a you know attractive youngest blonde female or I don't I've never seen a really extend herself the man who cares I'm not a thespian critic or a critic of the attack a but she said that she's worried about what will happen\nTo young women that see or people in general including her daughter I think she said with a fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty who was ... to wake her up from her dream because that there was a violation of could send that goes on there now I pointed out to you last week that\nThe the point is really not that there's a consent issue because they were talking about which has a magic apples and somebody's in a coma from eating the apple and it is a it is a fairy tale\nAnd really the only way for her to be awoken which is the the storyline is by a print to kiss her she saved her life like kissing her\nShow it's really almost like he's performing mouth to mouth resuscitation I Would say and therefore he does have consent if we're going to take it to this weird place where we're talking about this\nBecause if somebody is choking and you give the mouth to mouth resuscitation you don't have to say hey can you can you verbalize that your choking and I'm going to give you or you know or they're ... they're hard to stop and choking as the Heimlich hard to stop you get the idea\nAh some out the mouth resuscitation ... you know in in a fairy tale is really we're talking about here but they ran with this\nThey didn't stop they weren't they weren't it wasn't enough for them to just say I have an actress say that because there was another one I forget who another actress came at all I'm worried about fairy tales and the patriarchy so they're they're destroying centuries old stories\nThat is instill very basic one creative sensibility in young people but also have some basic morality and sales of good and evil and now they're fairy tales they're meant for amusement I promise you I don't know a single guy who in college age was like well\nBecause the handsome prince ... the girl in a coma or I can because this girl in real life you're like no one would ever think that nobody no human being has ever ever ever thought that\nSo this was a problem that did not exist but now they've gone even further with it and you know in that video I don't want to play it again for you because you've already heard it but you know there's some very ... first of all there's a curse and there's some\nAs they make it very clear that there are some are kind of crude sexual humor in there as well you know referring to the initial that he uses and everything and he's clearly supposed to be in a title frat bro the ... I mean there's there's all the the patriarchy left\nStuff is there but you know this is what the what the left doesn't yet grass is that they lose on this stuff they lose on these cultural issues where they are acting like maniacs\nUm and and this brings me to not just this battle over fairy tales and consent\nBut this whole this whole story that broke today about how Trump is uh taking is telling the idea of Jane now um that they should do this this is the story line at least\nA transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration now that is such a loaded headline\nA that is such a loaded headline in so many ways one of them is that no person can be defined out of existence a person as a person and all of us have equal rights under the law as people

the Republicans are going to do very well\nTired of high taxes which we gave the tax cuts winds up so much\nThat they want a strong military they want for executives I Want to safety they want security we give that the Democrats do not have that the Democrats don't know what they're doing they don't know what they're given I think we're going to do very very well in the ...\nNot in Trump's right I think that we're going to pick up Senate seat something's going to be fifty five you heard it here for fifty five Republican Senate seats by the by the end of this thing not quite the super majority of sixty although it would not be sweet midterms going to be tight I mean a house rather intimate church going to be tight very very tight I\nI think it could go either way right now and it's going to be just a few seats that separate the Democrats and Republicans\nAt the end the day but Trump is incredibly powerful voice in this whole debate and discussion I think that he's really making a very he's making the case very well\nWhich are the Democrats don't actually have an agenda or a platform other than trying to restore the legal and cultural edit fish of Obama is some\nWild Trump is president and they're ... they won't be able to do that so this is really just going to be much more a rhetorical battling much more fighting it out in the media and nastiness and it really is it is moms or jobs\nAnd Republicans need to hammer that home the\nPoint that I think they're on that and they're doing they're okay is that they could be stronger honest but on health care I'm furious with the Republicans because they don't have a unified message and because of a couple of very unreliable GOP senators we don't actually have\nA real achievement to speak of in a in the healthcare realm and Obamacare is garbage in\nTrump is allowing people to get out of the individual mandate but that and also giving states more flexibility in this but they need to be telling people what that means what it does for them you know they are not effective messengers on health care and that could be I really do think if if the Democrats when that when the house it's going to be because of that issue\nOn the Senate side however Ted Cruz versus a bet to Rourke a no surprise here Trump is going out there to Stanford Stanford Chad and I just thought the thought this was a nice moment in your play play quip twenty as Trump's on his way to Texas\nThat any more taxes go up and I had a very very nasty stuff\nIt was it was a very\nGood at it and we got together and then by the way very late in

lot I actually like you have a lot of very shy he loves people expect us to\nFact right now I guess they said they've never seen a fucking exam that goes on for miles is over a hundred thousand\nIs incredible the crowd all that's going to be reading Trump in Texas saying over a hundred thousand people have\nRegistered for this thing a ... we've had some fun with the whole ... ... on this show tonight\nOr but keep in mind it it's just yet another case study in the media malpractice and in the bias that's pushing so much of what they do every day I mean this guy beta ... never had a prayer never had a chance\nBut the media just cried short thirty eight million dollars\nOh they're going all in on this guy all in on it and I just feel like you know it couldn't be any more obvious they

regulation\nThat are supposed to have intelligence ... opinions are are actually more on 'em and and I know this is the thing that happens but I you know here's some guy that Wesley Lowery at the Washington Post he ... he wrote over the weekend after this Mitch McConnell saying\nQuote yelling and elected officials in public is protected First Amendment speech and it's pretty disgusting to see journalists lecturing our fellow citizens for directly petitioning government officials\nLike to fully brains clip everything he said here's ...\nIs wrong in in ... an hour ... yes it is is protected speech but that's relevant because they're protected speech we're talking about here in a restaurant no one's saying the government has a right to come in and arrest these people but the establishment can say get out your trespassing is private property\nThey have that right to you know the the left\nThinks that the first amendment means they get to say whatever they want an act however they want and nobody else gets to say anything about it because we're infringing on their rights by exercising our right they don't understand this they have no concept of\nA of rights existing in parallel to each other you know somebody can say something really stupid about Trump and I can say that was really stupid that doesn't mean that I'm getting their\nFirst Amendment right if I you know put tape over their mouth and locked him in a closet that's probably kidnapping but also it's that's negating their First Amendment right\nIf I refuse to give them a permit to speak and a public park when I get that permit to other people to speak in a public park because of viewpoints discrimination that's not respecting their first met right but in a restaurant no\nYou don't have the right to go to a restaurant and act like a moron or any more than he was the right to go to a restaurant and play your you know boom box which we used to have some you remember we used to have those the eighties and nineties poop [noise] the boom box you remember he's carried around with you\nI remember how cool you were high school was almost directly correlated with how big your speakers were you know you want to big speakers then you were really cool\nI was little speakers are much more starkly pleasing and people like why do you like little speakers book\nAnd and what other non speakers there there was a guy there was a public pool that I Would go to 'em over the week or well not really public but a community pool whatever that I used to go to over the summer and there's a guy to show up there\nWith and he would bring every time he was there he would bring a little outdoor speaker with him and play his weird\nBuddha Bar lounge music and and I just think that that's ... ... weird thing to do like everybody else the pool wants to hear your music you know that that's a bold thing to do to inflict on ever bring a Bluetooth speaker will use you can blast your music at a pool with a hundred people\nI think that's very very strange\nUm and I think that you know it's it's something that people should not do anyway back to Mitch McConnell and what's going on here and this guy was Lee at the Washington Post\nIs essentially a doesn't understand where the first amendment stops and starts and you see this from a lot of journalists which you think that people who make a living from the first amendment would have a better understanding of it but their understanding of the first amendment is they have special rights in privileges and everybody else needs to just deal with it\nUm but that's not the way that's not the way this is supposed to function that's not how this is supposed to go\nAnd Philly branch thing and it's just say that we're giving comfort to white nationalism and we're uh I I hate this talking point it's so vile it's so despicable and unfair and they keep saying all the time and it's just a way of shutting down any honest political dialogue\nWhich is why people like me I'm increasingly said over the last six months you know what the Russia collusion thing now they know they can't win that you're just you're just going to see that same\nThat same mentality that same insane tenacity around an issue where they think they can destroy the president\nThat's going to be a expanded to cover any number of things so that the the craziness that led them to believe that Russia collusion was going to bring down the president that same level of just was char\nOr will now be on everything the twenty Fifth Amendment stuff the can front of people in restaurants because that was just the that was the place where you had the first real symptoms of Tron trumped arrangements syndrome\nThe first major symptom was Russia is going to bring down the presidency it's really going to happen Trump is a Russian Jew Jenna Russian pawn where it's just a matter of time before we prove it and now you see that because that's just not going to work\nThere now pushing out into everything else and you're seeing the same and Saturday when the leap brains they're saying that you know it's it's not a big deal that people were yelling at Mitch McConnell and remember you know what I'm saying these people should be arrested were just saying they're idiots\nAnd people shouldn't do this and we should be able to share that opinion without people so you get your your opinion that's destroying the first amendment no\nIt is not it is not\nAnd uh I I just think that this is one of these places where you know you either have principles you don't abide by the way I'm not skipping over we just don't have unless you're there were there were a bunch of people that were harassing\nNancy Pelosi over the weekend too\nAnd they are total moron okay they absolutely should not should not\nOr be given any respect or any you know approval from any one I heard somebody say they were the Proud Boys I don't know I just know that there was a video of people so I'm getting over coal to my voice has been really shaky last week video of people who ... yeah that's right I called I did the show every day I don't miss the show him sick 'cause I Love all of you so much and I can't\nI Can't skip a day and the freedom huh unless I have a work thing I have to do but that's where\nA but the people yelling at below sea they've done nothing to help their cause a lot to harm it or if their cause is and I and I don't know what their cause I'm assuming it's just anti left wing something\nBut the left you are doing their huge favor no matter who you are if you say you're on the right and I know some people are talking false flag I haven't seen any evidence of that\nIf you say you're on the right and you are screaming and yelling and people on the left now you give them the ability to say oh see both sides are doing it when both sides are doing it but that one case will be magnified so those individuals who are banging on doors and yelling at below sea have done the far left a huge favor\nI just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network last week here in DC we caught up for a while I said hey mark how's business he's had businesses great we've got companies large and small coming to us for their background investigations and vetting and I know why that is folks because global verification is a U.S based veteran owned and operated\nBackground investigation company wherever your needs are for your age are department or if you're going to be leasing out a property to somebody if you need to make sure the person you are trends acting business with\nIs who they say they are you want to us based company a veteran owned and operated company one that doesn't offshore data doesn't send your stuff overseas and really just act as a middleman taken a cut\nAnd then you realize he hasn't said anything he's essentially done the usual lib trick of all I've got I've got some things that we've got to talk about we really care were mostly connected and solutions and think outside the box of all this\nGobbledygook and then all of this cop trap\nDoesn't give you a a solution he doesn't give you an answer a way of dealing with the problem he just said yeah\nYou know I I really care and I'm On it and we're going to fix this and you see there's so much with the Democrats it's really\nA reminder of how the Democrats are operating in general right now and what they're doing is effectively to ... try to connect emotionally with people without having to put forward any of their policies to try and make it seem like they care\nA few uh a few\nYou'll pay that's what they're you know and I wasn't the only thing that Bill Clinton was feeling back in the day I I'm just saying\nI'm just saying a ... you know also grapefruits in the grocery store and all kinds of you know orbital things orbital object but you know Clinton aside for a moment here\nThe problem that Democrats have is the more people understand about what Democrats want to do when it comes to governance the less they trust government the less they trust Democrats with governance\nOkay so you have to keep that in mind\nAnd the more that we find out that the Democrats don't have any solutions less will listen to their oh I've got solutions talk solutions like what\nHow do they want to do with homelessness the answer is they they don't want to clear the homeless off the street and tell them that you know ... and essentially enforce vigorously laws because that seems I mean right now you can't do that\nWell if we're going to create a system for keeping people off the street and we have places for them to go that are mentioned give them a safe place to sleep foods you eat and help to get back up on their feet\nWhich we do as a country that we do it better in some places than others but there are programs that exist for that purpose if we have those programs we should also be able to say hey you can't sleep and leave and poop in the street\nBecause that's what they're doing and it's not good for the people that are living on the street it's not safe it's not sanitary but the the liberal mentality is\nThat they don't want to enforce the laws against the less fortunate because they want to use the less fortunate as a political ... aren't they want to use the plight of people live on the street to say oh you know we need we need more funding we need more funding\nYou know look at the big mean Republicans with their tax breaks and nobody is homeless because of Republican tax break\nNobody is homeless because of Republican fat cats doing you know private equity restructuring or something people lose their jobs I mean I'm not saying it's all fine but\nThe you know they they take it to this point and and the other issue is when you look at a mental health as a factor in homelessness\nUm yes that's true but really what he means by mental health is is generally a addiction that's the primary\nOr the primary factor that you find with homeless population is all across the country putting aside this whole homeless by choice movement which is a new thing which is happening in this country as well people say oh housing is too expensive I'm just going to choose to be homeless\nA but you know I I Would I Would tell you that it's roughly Seventy to eighty percent of the homeless population is is the number that I Believe I've seen but don't quote me on it\nUm but it's a huge majority for sure of the homeless population has either a drug problem a drinking problem or a serious mental health issue very severe schizophrenia or any number of\nDifferent diagnoses and that means these are people who need help [noise]\nAnd it is not helping them to leave them in the public square literally in the public square to engage in all kinds of [noise] you know human activity in bodily function and things that\nAre unsafe and you know not the way that people should be living but that means you're gonna have to have police in social workers and I'll just come ones that are already got to come with me we're going to get you off the street we're going to help you you don't just leave them there to wallow in their

very different idea about the single biggest most\nExistential threat to the United states here she is in her own words [noise]\n\n\nThat's right we're talking about Nazi Germany now there's better be very serious I assume she must be talking\nAbout what happens when China's economy surpasses our own and we have a country with a billion people that wants to be the preeminent global superpower or at least something incredibly serious that's really going to happen and be a real concern for us right [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact of the matter is really radical truth no your not oh my gosh\nClimate change folks climate change\nAnd renewable energy I mean the but let's understand this the ... energy is\nNot about economics it's not about\nMaking a more efficient energy source for businesses the renewable energy is nowhere near as efficient as a carbon based a fossil fuels right there there's just there's no comparison even still with some of the technological advances\nBut renewable energy is what we have to devote ourselves to as though it were an existential crisis similar to what we faced in the second World War\nI don't know how liberals go through the day being quite so crazy and quite so bizarre but but they obviously do and there is very clearly a strain of contemporary liberalism that wants to\nBelieve in the extreme catastrophe scenario of global warming slash climate change last and I'm really starting to recognize this as a disease of the uh western mind in the industrialized world of of the twentieth and twenty first century\nThat because there has been an existential crisis for the individual as the individual has moved away from God and his sense of a divine purpose for being on this earth\nThe existential purpose that exists for these people
