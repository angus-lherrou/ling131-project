University presidents that in a statement of colleagues and students that his actions projected to damage I'm not proud of that is not flattering and certainly not expected from the president of southeast Missouri State University\nDuring my attendance at a tailgate party prior to the southeast football game I was observe being offered accepting a drink from a beer bomb a device normally associated with excessive or binge drinking which is conduct I Do not condoned his statement ... read\nWell\nI mean it's not necessarily ideal for college presidents who get caught drinking from a

like it because I was surrounded by my students and they got a laugh out of it and it was fun and for a brief moment in time I was actually related to a normal person\nAnd here's my state but I'm not

studios\nYou're\nSeeing their own investigation nine ...\nFox News Saudi Arabia now says they're looking into the disappearance of journalist your mouth to show me last seen three weeks ago and during this valley consulate in Istanbul\nWe have laws we have laws that are in place specifically so that we do not have people show up\nAnd just stay\nIf we didn't have those yes we've been open borders state the Democrats are planning to demagogue this issue they are going to use this\nTo try and get their base fired up are going to try to use this to create this sense of a moral separation between the Trump Administration and the Democrat Party and between the Republicans who support Trump on this issue and the Democrats\nAnd is very likely that these individuals who are going to show up at the border will end up in the interior of the United states ah they will be processed but if they claim asylum if they\nTurn themselves in a and they claim asylum they are going to get a hearing hearing will be delayed so you'll have a ... another wave in another wave\nWhat happens when you have a law that has not enforced\nWhat happens when the state has decided their actions that are bad but there are no consequences for that bad behavior or seeing this happen right now\nIt is show very easy\nFor Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats\nWho don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs who don't have to worry about illegal immigrants uh and draining resources from over already overcrowded public schools public schools that are attended by Americans of all ethnic backgrounds of all religions\nThey don't have to worry about that doesn't affect them in fact\nThey view it as nothing but win win by being essentially for open borders from Latin America at least in this country the Democrats get to feel morally superior\nThey get to achieve power and perhaps\nEven eventually defeat the Republican Party for ever by changing the demographics of this country sucks it there'll be a majority of voters built in for always and and forever for the foreseeable future at least ... vote Democrat\nBecause they know that\nImmigrants particularly the elderly people wealth [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for them but who really knows what's happening there\nUh but but immigrants in general uh tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of big government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stop we can't keep doing this the answers\nIt's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is a very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like the president to take the following actions no they want to point fingers and scream racist and they want photos of crying children being separated from parents they want photos of\nPeople looking hopeless and indigent being told by immigrations and Customs Enforcement or being told by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody\nAnd they hope to make this an emotional issue if it's really that emotional for them why don't they just make the case that the imagery makes for them which is well I guess we should just taking everyone\nAnd everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and who have respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have\nMS NBC CNN New York times Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\nAnd it's just very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances than it was just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be in different countries different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders and a welfare state I think the answers are really that the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows is\nNo other country in the world takes in a million people and makes them legal and God Bless and welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nA lot every year were ... million through our legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from I think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand oh my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster\nWell hold on a second we're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing can a number only go one direction can only get larger\nThis is also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even in office for if we're lucky the next six years\nTo try and stem the tide of recurrent migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall Democrats don't want to do because Wal\nFirst off would prove its utility very quickly and then they all look foolish or walls don't work no pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property in has a ten foot cement wall things just got a little harder you may think twice about walking onto their property and trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they said oh walls don't work it works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works\nSo why wouldn't workouts were all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works\nAnd they're they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an on look he has an unfulfilled promise now as to who's behind this march and who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I I don't know but I Do know that this is not a coincidence that you have the largest of these migrant caravans that I that I Know of just\nA couple of weeks before the midterm elections on the way the border this allows the media to play the emotional manipulation game this allows them to forget about the fact that the economy is incredibly strong to forget about the fact that all their\nPredictions about economic calamity because of Trump and all the things that they've said twenty Fifth Amendment he has to be removed 'cause he's crazy Russia collusion that the mainstream media has wasted over a year of the American people's time\nOn this fantasy that Trump colluded with Russia worse than a fantasy minute it's a plot it's a plot that was put into motion by anti Trump elements in our own government to undermine the president I'd states\nThey wasted a year of our time on this year and a half of our time ones it's insane is absolutely insane but they\nCan get enough people at the border looking sad looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and then talk about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety\nOf all involved and also yes as a deterrent you separate people from their children at the border you should reunite them but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again another trumping just rations changed the way that they were going to do it because the outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours\nWe're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again I'm not making that up people were saying that about this\nPeople that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse which\nIn itself just astonishing\nWe are in a fight my friends and we need to understand it as such the other side plays dirty what's at stake here the future of the Trump agenda and the trajectory of this country for at least the next two years really the next six\nWe've got a couple of weeks to figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to do it we'll talk more about it right after this break [noise]\n\nSeven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals they lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale\nFighting the streets Tim Kaine says\nNot afraid of the popular a crime in ... so the mobs right mom in the streets that up what what are we talking about their Tim\nWe'll see I told you yesterday that there were two uh two GOP candidates in Minnesota\nWho were physically attacked why haven't you heard that story until this radio show oh I Wonder I Wonder why it was somebody probably did\nUm but\nThat seems to me to be more of a new story that were than anything that we've heard recently about the uh the way the left his acting right and then you also have another incident where a democratic operative\nFor a group bridge American bridge twenty first century which is a David Brock group he founded it funded by\nGeorge Soros and taught us legs the American that age twenty first century any because it's about democracy and democratization than by that time in socialism\nOr but this guy is called the tracker which I didn't even know it was a thing I've well I Know it's a thing for you know animals hunting and but I didn't know something you didn't politics and he follows around\nPolitical opposition which to me sounds a bit like being a page soccer\nBut he followed around one woman who was the female is the female campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial nominee Adam lack salt\nHer name is Kristin Davis in and she was attacked by this guy or he grabbed her and her and her and left bruises on her he has now been arrested\nWhat the heck is going on here folks I I thought were in the midst of the the me too movement in women's empowerment and\nWhy haven't you heard on all the different major networks\nFox is covering it I mean this is the Fox news piece Russia of course Fox will cover it but we're all the other networks where are they on this\nThis guy assaulted a woman because he's been hired by a Soros group to essentially harasser to follow her around your two Republicans who were attacked one punch really badly actually had a concussion from it by some crazy Democrat there's a video we don't have it but if some complete loon\nBruce or might you know talk about the some video out there or was this guy ripping up yard signs she'd Democrat Democrat Democrat Democrat all the people are doing the crazy stuff\nOn the left why is that\nWhere are the stories about Republican mobs were the ... not that I'm saying I Want the point is they don't exist that's why the left is a touchy about this stuff it's not a good look when the American people see what the left is really all about when the American people see how the progressive act out\nWe don't make it\nWe don't want to get these people power we don't want them to be in charge of more of our day to day lives give them greater authority greater influence over the economy and over the law is a terrible idea\nI think people are waking up Democrats have\nPlayed their hand poorly in the last\nThree months two months they have been showing\nA side of themselves that is the truth but\nIt's one that they're usually more adept at hiding because the left is in fact the political\nWing of the mob mentality\nOf mobs in the streets of mobs in restaurants of kicking women at a pro life march remember that when that guy went viral\nOf tearing up yard signs in screening people's faces of being a member of antifa who yells at a woman who lost her husband in nine eleven since disgusting and disgraceful things to her on video [noise]\nWith went that already for yesterday [noise]\nThat's what the left is really all about [noise]\nThat's who they become [noise]\nAnd now the American people\nVideo [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that [noise]\nWe\nWon the face of all he calls the\nFor your call\nHe ... he didn't have them all into the ...\n[noise] [noise]\n\nAll\nBullet holes\n\nSpartacus\nWants you to believe that he thinks democracies in peril Cory Booker is technically his name but I like to call in Spartacus because he said he was part of it so I think that's fair\nWhat the heck is he talking about democracy that you know we were going to hand or children ... what does that mean\nThis is my favorite question to ask people what is what what are you really saying what does that mean how is it in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are going up on another way what what is the peril that democracies in right now this is like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this it's\nJust rhetoric it's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing just democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant maybe you could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\n\nWhere do we find these Democrats poor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there they're fascinating leftists there are people you can talk to I I I Know people were anarchists that I Love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interests\nBeing belief systems in at least it's worth engaging you learn something but the the marquee Democrats\nThese days it's just all pitiful it's all nonsense\nBooker and Warren and Sanders and fighting and none of them have anti any intellectual heft whatsoever it's remarkable when you think about what ideas do they stand for redistribution of wealth defending our democracy\nThat's\nNot that that's not a policy solution it's not interesting people have been talking about that for a very long time and get them very far\nI'm going to do is very bad things happen\nBut there's there's just nothing that's even more listening to most of these people about Bernie Sanders has a kind of sharman an ... an authenticity that comes across 'cause you know what the government Brooklyn so I looked him 'cause he runs the people that I Know from Brooklyn and\nYou know you hear him talk about these things you say okay well that sounds he sounds like he's well intentioned but then when you started to get things like math you go well this isn't gonna work this is crazy\nIt's a really bad idea same thing with all of them\nWhat does what does Kamala Harris stand for whatever the Democratic party tells you to stand for what is Cory Booker stand for same what is was warned stand for basically the same\nBernie Sanders' same Joe Biden a number one in a CNN poll recently about who they think's going to run for president they've got nothing and I think that's part of why there's such a desperation and why they're being violent mother attacking people either hurting people\nBecause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans and the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of candidates in terms of a bench\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families you know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic incoming are actually trying it now in a a trying it in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas they have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all they can do is get people angry by telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where I'll talk to you a somewhat about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators who are leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate\nMay have in fact caused the Republicans to gain seats I think you'll see fifty four fifty five GOP seats by the end of the election and the Senate I think we're going to go to fifty four fifty five\n... total solution to any type of words he would ever want to do around your house\nAnd best of all it's completely free though to how much either dot com or download the free and\n[noise]\nDoes the country want to put a check on Donald Trump\nDo we want to put a check on Trump ism\nSo we want to repudiate it or do we want to validate it because should the Republicans\nMaintain majority control in the house should they maintain majority control in the Senate this president will not only be unchecked\nHe will be emboldened and at the core what he's doing is stoking a cold civil war in this country ... the American people use that ... in the history of the country who makes new preach about being the leader of the American people here's the leader\n\nOf a sudden he sees political analysis of such crash\nSee Schmidt is among the very worst we'll talk more about it he's going to get another parent later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put them on TV a lot of MSNBC though\nWhat are you saying isn't true by the way what he's saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of ... or something but it's not just Trump it's on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not a the Republicans are not treating it as old as only Trump on the ballot first of all every single\nCongressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that should be the guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that\nUh but beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the last couple of weeks last few weeks that could change this election much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I I had a I had a chat with a Lindsey Graham last night spoken for about twenty minutes we sat down we're over Fox and I was I was up Lindsey we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh\nBut here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game 'cause you know Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local elections\nRather [noise] uh the state and and congressional level of healthcare\nYou don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging and healthcare help your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling showed that that actually for the people were going to vote that matters to them\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently and what you see is that the\nCabinet ... effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake\nIs\nThat's not gonna fly that's not going to work um the dynamic of this playing out right now\nIs the uh\nThe dynamics playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think it's really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the needy because they're ... they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections\nThat are in states where it's kind of a ... a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's\nA little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet issue want Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats would power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple where there you're going to have the Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did a Kavanaugh\nYou can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any if any more authority and they're already have all the lives the American people and cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just huge a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is they didn't anticipate that in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women\nAre scary is about what happened to capping off furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if you're somebody who's like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know not not in ... with some of what Trump has drawn to it but you're you're a a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right wing in suburban districts that makes this\nHouse contract it's going to be down to the wire this is going to be really close I think could she'll go to the Republican so that would feel like a miracle but it could still happen\nAnd\nIt's going to be because of cap and also folks that fight that we had to defend Kavanaugh is critical [noise]\nI've got a cup of it in my hands right now my friend black rifle coffee and I'm drinking it black\nBecause it is delicious coffee\nIn fact I've turned a bunch of people in my office and just in my day to day life in the black rifle coffee drinkers\nOnce they tried to realize that this is as good as any coffee you'll get anywhere and on top of that it's a company that you will appreciate it veterans that Ron black rifle coffee and they found that by the way and now they're all about patriotism freedom and delicious brew all day every day\nAnd that's going to be the ... that's the kind of decision that is going to be the very top level of any government US government any government whether they're going to let that information get out if they have a short memory could be a human source right we don't know but if you're going to have\nProof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to\nSay where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise] ah so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet um but I Do think that there is a very\nReal possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna probably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one because they're going to say that it's just something that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and ah there'll be better in the future or something like that\nAnd got to remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us play quip sex as secretary of state palm pay Oregon\nTitle for the Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that so that we do with understanding of the fact that was when we can make decisions about how the United states should respond [noise] onto\nSurrounding this show I think it's first of all the number to wherever he wants a sightseeing thirty two long relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia [noise] they continue to be important kind of terrorism\nTested it with the two holy sites\nForeign ... alliance the United states we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that we want to just discount and just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can't make all of our problem\nI Know that there's symbolism year journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent within this country not the same as being a citizen but he definitely had\nVery real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis\nYou certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team and last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish ditch Turkish sovereignty here\nI mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be\nAn investigation that is highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get and how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak\nVice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences play clip ten oh I can assure you\nBegan\nThere will be consequences the vice president says noticed that people are pretty pretty thin on details of what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response\nWhich would be both overt covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here and what would happen from a major fracture\nIn the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want a major break with the Saudis and the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look\nJust remember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these ... which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean and it's going to be a really big step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came to power\nLet me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and\nI Would offer to you probably much more hard line Islamists than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach and Saudi Arabia right now only do show with the acceptance and the and they say so of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship\nWith them is because the worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario that the government is overthrown in either of those places and Pakistan because you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia we have very few powerful millet\nThey're allies left in the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan is a good ally but it's a small country not but not for the wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam eyes and they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East\nSaudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there Egypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems are and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping to place doesn't\nCollapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government could never be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around and one way or another getting stop ... whatever they they end up doing\nBut Steve Schmidt maybe dumber\nAnd it's amazing having seen having seen how he's the hero in the HBO movie about Sarah Palin's an ill fated vice presidential run and they see the real steep since\nHe was like yeah you know I still like with the judge and the Republicans and stuff than you know murder you irrational ...\nHere Steve Schmidt Len let your let let let you hear how close the impersonation really is worth in\nIs the leader of a faction and his dividing us and those divisions will take years and years and years and here we are one people\nWe're one people we're on the American people and when you say a president in the United states doing what he's doing to this country not to mention the unraveling of the U.S led liberal global order that\nEmerged from the horror and the catastrophe and out of the death camps in the ruins of a war that killed eighty million people\nHis fidelity to democracy is Neal is the deli ... small L liberalism is not there and you see it with his complicity ended is complicity in the murder of a Washington Post columnist by a Middle Eastern thug\nComplicit in how you complicit you ... how is he complicit what the heck does this have to do with Trump that was on MSNBC they should be embarrassed that they would air that kind of\nStupidity complicit by everything\nHe said was wrong everything except for oh he doesn't believe in a box of really Trump gets shot down by judges in the Ninth Circuit left and right over stuff it's it's ridiculous but you know he goes OK well see you in court\nHow was how was Trump destroying democracy how's Trump\nDo any of those small liberalism you mean like cutting regulations and cutting taxes that's that sounds like small L liberalism just the guy everything he says it's not true as in any [noise]\nDon't want to say mean things you just dumb\nDoesn't know any international relations either like I should stipulate\nNot talking on TV about that [noise]\n\n\nYou [noise]\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the place we saw never tough [noise]\n\nYou got it where you say the Miller is appropriate and independent\nBut you can't answer countless question about something you said in a meeting with the deputy head of the of the FBI at a time when he was frankly acting head of the FBI 'cause it's a told me he had been fired by the memo you will fill the fact that Rod Rosenstein with a no show last week it is something that is just not right either obligated\nAs a guy who Senate confirmed when the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over your agency asked me to come to Congress as if he were obligated to do that you're supposed to do it under oath and he was a no cell yeah he's got time to talk to the press about the Mueller investigation of Russian\nRosenstein thinks that he's kind of a law unto themselves folks deputy attorney general guy overseeing the Russia investigation really has no problem acting like he is part of his own branch of government and really he's running his own branch of government that branch of government is the F. B. a\nSeal you ask for a miracle I bring you the F.\nB. or\nTo get that one but not really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hash tag resistance and Trump knows is to just not worth getting rid of them the hash tag resistance would call them politically and utterly freak out\nIf in fact there was a a a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care he got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein to step down as a ... a deputy attorney general\nBecause lawmakers are looking into reports about how rose aside once talked about wearing a wire drew record present drop you know I really do believe that if when I was a little\nA little a little nobody CIA analyst if I had said that I was going to wear a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I I think I Would have been scored it out of the building bicycles by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people\nBut for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like ... two weeks ago said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very\nTight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself but that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough\nHere's with Fox News reports about meadows a of the Freedom Caucus he says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting a reason imitation to testify before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reporter comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because getting rid of them might feel kind of messy\nAnd I thought the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nThis treasury employee who is charged with leaking financial fence and reports on Trump gene people\nShe was apparently arrested with a flash drive in hand here's a quote from Fox the top

services so when you're a service economy\nThe way to stimulate the economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to be anything that raises the price is a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a tariff it's just another tack\nBefore we're close out here as well as her real quick here to get from a grade on the economy a through at what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents are pretty good regulations are down and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a thing as subjectivity\nAnd in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way this way\nBut the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound as not lasting it's based on that\nAnd the payment will come too soon\n\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and NFL who's saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Wal Mart and\nI was gonna say Sears R. I. P. Sears R. I. P. but these are very different views\nWhat's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul uh let me let me deal with Ron Paul ...\nI was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul [noise] ah [noise] he's right\nRon Paul was right mathematically historically he is correct a there is a\nVery clear history of currency\nIn a in the history of the world additives that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity is very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now that said\nRon Paul saying that the economy right now is not found a way too much debt and all that he can be right but on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't want to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have right telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I don't I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came of on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I\nJust put his I put his words in there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our debt\nWe got to remember that we're we're heading in a brand new a bad place might not be\nTwo years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political will\nYou know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what I I really\nWish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut\nWhen I get home that's the thing they exist\nOr you know deciding to just eat half a wheel of brie that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections and the economy\nDoes that sound will to fancy rags debris debris delicious your is fantastic uh I was like American cheese on America Jews on my burger yesterday was delicious [noise]\nAh [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that I have to think strategically about this you want to deal with your immediate\nNeeds answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know [noise] uh that doesn't mean we shouldn't take action that just means we need to be aware that the actions not going to come quickly and\nWe should balance out what are what what what risks are except what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy to our children and grandchildren's economies are and then you Gary Cohn with tariffs on China\nI I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given up a lot of credit on the turf issue and um I've been willing to say that I I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists and I know the the smart set is almost always an entirely opposed to tour\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can\nThat said ah I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going to have the economy it's been a ... a few weeks and people have ... ... people have seen so stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's\nThat's when you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you\nThe Democrats easiest path to power is a recession where
