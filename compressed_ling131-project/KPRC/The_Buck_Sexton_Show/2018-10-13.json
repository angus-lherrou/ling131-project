American pastor Andrew Brunson now in Germany for a medical checkup after being released from house arrest in Turkey earlier today families folks enjoyed and secular\nThat nobody could really know that's something that nobody was able to to figure out until now what it looks like oh that's right that televised ritualized torture session of Brett Kavanaugh on national TV turns out Republicans haven't forgotten about that\nAnd turns out it was a reminder of what we face on the left but\nI think that the Kavanaugh debacle for the left was really just in a sense the last straw that has pushed them over the edge but they were already heading in that direction and these these symptoms of the mass\nDelusion of leftist that are manifesting themselves with these mad a masters in these mobs coming together and screaming and yelling and this mob mentality and on and the really the lack of\nAbility on the media's part just set the narrative the way they want you in their rage which comes out now more on there I think it's because they realize\nTrump is winning\nHe still winning they haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense\nThey haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable anybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and all the investigations that his finances I\nMean the New York times did I think it was a twelve thousand word essay on Trump's taxes stretching back\nTo his father's taxpaying\nPractices in the seventies I think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean they they went way way deep and it was and I read this piece of thoughts\nOf this is this is kind of like the scene and John Nash\nShowed that John Nash hasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy riding on all this stuff all the formulas in the wall and you and then you realize oh\nThis person has a problem the media has a problem\nCrump maybe has caused it but they're the ones with\nThe problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and\nThey have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they really going to all of a sudden you know to discover that oh Russia manipulated this election is that going to be the play\nIt might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick to that will work what do they tell themselves now I Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is a racist Trump is a is a\nSexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president that they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you hook you'll hear on the left the worst president while time unfit for office should be removed from office\nBecause of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason\nAnd it turns out he's doing a really good job economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know and\nThis is their life's work has studied is that even though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan would've called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have\nThe oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying that as you get worse last Eighteen months and it has it so what do they kill themselves what did they come away with and this then brings me to the outrage mobs\nAnti ... and the uh you know the the the women's march ... creatures in the anti Kavanaugh hordes than the the stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers\nWho are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them all we had a Republican who put up blocks slap on some hallway stalkers today we'll get to him later\nBig high five bugs issues increasingly looking like the last\nIs going to have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable in terms of\nPropaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can\nJust stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from from reaching its its intended goals from doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it and I think that what set in with many of them is it's not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nMen's left must be telling themselves we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we couldn't at least get I'm gone at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turn on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I\nAm more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month what does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage and noise and anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I noticed it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interests of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with Kavanaugh the very end of that nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something they will create whole claw some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough\nThat they have a successful mid term election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something not because they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America period\nThey never or reflective on the situation in an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and and it's crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all that that they just hate him so much they don't look at this for what it really is\nAnd I do think that the the rage moms or anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are\nAn opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump's but that's only part of the story the other part of it is that they are now inflicted\nWith self doubt they won't talk about it they won't share it with you but how could they not be this was the man they said was incapable of leading incapable of running the federal government and capable of being a successful president\nAnd he is blowing away the critics right now\n\nThat's got to be a strange place for them to be\nThere are obviously not adjusting well to it there have been sore losers from the start\nBut now I I think that Trump is living rent free in their heads in a way that it it's just going to get worse for them\nAnd I don't know where it goes but if they if they don't take it leaves the house and I'm ... I'm telling you that because it would have a cabinet I'm starting to feel like maybe we could pull out a surprise you eat in the you know the pollsters over at a you know five twenty eight or five thirty eight or whatever it's called\nOr they're saying about twenty five or thirty percent chance the Republicans hold out that's not enough and\nI think it's a little higher than that too but\nWe shall see aid for for a nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred ... we have a ruckus show here in the freedom operate out by my buddy ... joined it talk about just what's top of mind with him and this week in politics you've also got Dr Sebastian\nGorka I wanted to get a whole bunch of my uh my favorite guests and on the line here we've got ... joining a we also have soccer and Jedi really really a great up and coming a political reporter he's the White House reporter for the Daily Caller who's going to be shedding some light on the whole Kanye phenomenon this week and\nWe allow things also want to hear from you ate for for nine hundred bucks we'll be right back [noise]\n\nHave you ever find yourself when sing at the weak sauce taste of some comic coffee from one of those left leaning corporate brand you probably wish they spent less time on their politics and more time on their coffee that's why you choose black rifle coffee it's found\nMany\nOf you have been praying for this day I Want to thank you I Know the pastor ... and his entire family want to thank you as well and of course a huge thank you to the president and his team for securing the release of Andrew Brunson\nFrom turkey [noise]\nHe's a I think in good shape there'll be stopping most likely in Germany for a full checkup\nThen he's going to be coming to the oval office most likely on Saturday\nBut we're very honored to have him back with us he uh he suffered greatly but we're very appreciative to a lot of people a lot of people\nSo fast that runs in in the air heading to Germany and then coming to the U.S he'll be landing on Saturday most likely Saturday in DC\nAnother diplomatic\nVictory for the Trump Administration\nUs pastor Andrew Brunson has been freed from a Turkish prison where he spent almost two years\nServing time there um and a related charges something to do with terrorism and espionage\nDoes it become a major diplomatic dispute between turkey which is increasingly trending under air to wants government away from its relationship with the U.S still an ally but it's getting more and more chance with time but this was a major diplomatic spat and sure enough\nThe Trump Administration its diplomats were\nAble to get him out\nAnd he should be home in a in a matter of of ours now so a Trump tweeted out today my thoughts and prayers are with pastor Brunson and we hope to have him safely back home soon as you can stop and Germany's you heard there\nSo the dishes yet again what we've been told all along the Trump would not be able to accomplish that he would not be adept in this area which is the international affairs and the people say oh bucket wasn't a ham it was other heat the buck stops with him\nOkay he is the commander in chief he's the president and when things like this happen high level US government negotiations and in this kind of desirable outcome you have to be willing to say okay we we give the president some credit for this one\nUm we get a president credit and and then there's also what's been going on race with China here's Larry Kudlow played fourteen\n[noise] I just would hope\nWould show greater appreciation\nFor the ask\nThat President Trump has been making\nA with regard to blows markets are with regard to uh I ... through a divorce transfer of technology there are structural issues technology is Ryan give away the family jewels there's no reciprocity I'm trading and terrorists\nSo there's a whole menu of things and I hope they get around to talking about it and perhaps the Chinese will be a little more um cooperative\nAnd with that whole menu of things by the way the law brings up those have been problems for for decades but other administrations didn't even try to fix those problems other administrations just allow them to continue on why oh we we we can't mess with China\nSomeone give us a reason for that\nWhat's the explanation for why we can't mess with China\nThey're not Texas right don't mess with Texas a ... suffering in silence was a better option know Trump is taking on that are taking on that whole slew of problems\nAnd could lowest right you know the Chinese government needs to be brought into line here and it's going to require some pushing it's not an easy thing to do but Trump is taking on things that are important without regard you well is this the simplest route\nObama showed his what eight years of sitting back relaxing and not really doing very much in thinking you're brilliant for that uh when it comes to foreign policy he showed us what that results in\nOn the world she knows a lot of strategic patience leading from behind a lot of fancy ways of saying don't make\nAny decisions just focus on the process lots and lots of processed lots of talk\nWell turns out that if you are willing to tackle heart problems and make tough decisions you could accomplish things in the world stage that the Trump approach on the economy on foreign policy [noise] just the Trump ... you could almost say\nIdentifying a problem and taking action to fix it is the Trump doctor [noise]\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is back\nThe Steele dossier that comes out sometime early July when did you personally learn about the memos and yet\nSometime in the fall I don't remember exactly when\nYou're talking for all of us are full of sixteen right so who told you about them [laughter] I don't remember someone on my senior staff you know how they were described I remember they brief me about it explained that it came from a reliable source\nWell that seems ridiculous that I'd have to do it when everybody is no collusion but I'll do what is necessary to get it they've spent\nTens of millions of dollars doing this and it's a disgrace and on top of the committees and out in the Senate\nAnd house you take a look at what they've done is they've interviewed everybody can you can imagine you could interview and then Richard Murdoch said a few days ago and it says we've found absolutely no collusion founded on different there is no collusion but it should end\nBecause it's bad for the country that when you talk about religion and the country it's bad for the country\nWhen is the force but also it's ongoing nightmare uh this bureaucratic\nMachinery of destruction known as the uh the Mueller probe what is it going to end\nI Know it's not going to be before the election but I certainly hope it ends within weeks after the election I I Do have concerns are going to stretch this thing into twenty Nineteen\nBut I I just\nWould love to think that enough people have been paying attention and realize what a scam this whole thing is and what a deep state soft coup disgraceful pile of garbage this whole effort to stop and undermined and remove all of these things\nPresident Trump has been\nYou know ... there was a story there was something that I didn't get a chance to tell you a better in the week the Mueller probe here's the kind of stuff we actually get from this ongoing national debacle of the Mueller probe quote\nA California man engineered and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's election interference was sentenced on Wednesday to six months in prison six months of home detention two years of release\nRichard Pena Nieto pleaded guilty to one count of identity fraud seven months ago and cooperative with Governor investigators in the case against the Internet Research Agency the Russian troll farm accused of interfering in the twenty sixteen presidential election\nAnalysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you got a lot of analysts talking about this one to the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with policy ... obviously a bit annoyed by it because they they're saying you know why is the president and detracting away from his great we with Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally attuned know that more Americans saw that clip ... anything else\nAt the end of the day you know if you were to go around\nAnd at at somebody you know a universal studios like they used to duty on on on late night shows and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West up in the president's perspective\nHe's using the star power of ... in order to talk about you know talk about criminal\nJustice reform it really was kind of a I have a hilarious moment in the oval office although it was funny to be behind the scenes I was in the at the White House while all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day\nCome out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away you could see it on her face and they were just\nSaying this was wild one of the camera guy told me\nThat in the thirty years' that he's covered the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter]\nThat's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet uh what are we expecting tonight that Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the GOP hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean the the amount of coverage and scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who\nIs running because people have actually told me before other campaign that one of the things they love about when the president comes as you get national TV coverage you know when does and that last time that\nAge you know some house candidate in Ohio six\nIs going to be getting into ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging in that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea you know he he's been having a saint campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night\nHe's got one tonight he's got one tomorrow night you've had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talks about\nHis record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I've certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies that is that is absolutely the case of ... what are we what are we expecting by the way on on the policy side for for next week is there anything that that that you think it's going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that anything that we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on reelection that being said uh you know in terms of ... that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nKnew African president about that right I mean you ask them about the reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I after a week before you did I think and and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the\nIssue is that he had he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that and the last press breathing that we had and she refused to commit to a timeline of before the midterms\nSo for now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents and I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general Horwitz he he is very uh very cognizant of of dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long time\nIn order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime soon\nWhat's the best part of being a White House correspondent being the White House all day soccer\nVast part is just being able to see I mean you can be they're up front to get to get yelled at by hitting rock like we were yesterday or somebody said one of our what our colleagues we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for these people to come in and you shot questions at a\nAnd a ... somebody asked Mr Iraq which I thought it was funny they called him Mr rock as much a rock are you going to fire or do you think Trump should fire Jeff Sessions he said he should fire all view before [laughter] wow\nThat's amazing so by the way you know usually as as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um you know act\nLike you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of of prominence let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock and beyond that 'cause I have a selfie because it's kid rock [laughter]\nYeah exactly it's it's it's like that's it day to day stuff it's oh if Jim Brown is here kid rock is here ah you know Tom Brady Rob Gronkowski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dreams\nWell do and then on the other hand you also get to talk of the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day so\nIt got to be the most on President in all history to get to have a conversation with that I Know you are the over the over ... recently it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview them so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\nYeah he really is a force of nature and and it's like you said your your your your your throat out there to latch on to it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty in another direction and you you try weapon Ninety through a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what it is\nAnd that that really is exactly like I said it it\nWe we love the ... it's just one of those things where you can always get it off after ... ... it's hilarious\nI think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him\nAnd said have you talked to the Saudi about you know the current situation with this is missing journalists probably murdered journalist and he just said I don't want to say that yet\nAnd [laughter]\n\nWell you know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just started going through all of the discussion there is the vote you know what you see on TV that what we what you get in\nThe ... one for every one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you are the White House correspondent that box accent as an open challenge to anyone on your ping pong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of the ... gone the Victor\nOkay yeah I'll read that word it's definitely not going to be but I oh okay I have a future that we could put up against\nYou you you do your Daily Caller ping pong champion that that the ping pong champion up the hill dot com wants to piece alright you spread the word or I meant saga good work as always have a great weekend we'll talk to you soon\nThanks for having me bought\nJak out soccer's latest Daily Caller dot com team quick break we'll be right back\n[noise] hey see more of the things that make the show so special is the exchange of information\nThat we have day in and day out I get to talk to you use email you call in right to me\nAnd that means that we're constantly learning from each other and we're also able to share our conservative values and spread all kinds of ideas\nUm he also talked about Chicago and and and and the crime rate than he talked about unemployment he talked about the thirteenth many talked about you know ... not being able to read even all over the place had talked to someone who's very familiar with the car dashing they used to be a text messaging with rage and I you know who ...\nHe was once close with anti dashing\nSo\nCovers all these different issues a lot of them are issues that are actually a really high importance in the policy discussion in this country but has to say that you know he's he's crazy which strikes me as a a really underhanded a nasty way of of well undermining his argument\nBut then when you when you listen to some of things can you said it's not that he's crazy it's that\nYou could maybe say he's crazy like a Fox I mean it's it's that he actually hit home with some of the things that he was saying when the when I went back and and read the transcript today and spend a little more time listening to some of the soundbite and when you take away all the\nYou know the the sort of flashing lights pomp and circumstance situation all this high profile Oval Office meeting here's some of the stuff that county actually said play to\nThe data and that meant going on is on the legal or illegal\n... na na na legal ... we have a right to bear off\nThe problem is illegal guns he says\nNow you and I both know that that's that is established fact at this point that that is very clear the problem is is illegal guns legal gun owners\nAre actually not just a lesser criminal threat than your average American they also have the effect of reducing crime and ... violent crime you can go read Jon lots more guns less crime for the in depth analysis with all the numbers on that\nOr give put plugs to people that are friends with the show\nBut the fact that he said this upsets oh many liberal they hate\nWhen anyone breaks ranks on the issue of guns because guns are such a a simplistic issue for stupid left wing Hollywood social justice warriors to feel like they're really brave and strong on\nAnd they live in this complete echo chamber of everybody knows that guns are so bad everybody wants to get rid of guns because guns kill people and they won't engage anywhere beyond that I mean I I tried to talk to a list of Milan does of course a meat you leader\nWe talk to her out in California and uh she said that it's as easy to buy an air Fifteen and just to buy a cappuccino at Starbucks that's just a lie\nI mean if yeah if you had mandated federal background checks for all purchases and you had to be\nEighteen and you couldn't have a criminal record and you couldn't be a drug user and you couldn't be it ever convicted of domestic violence and you couldn't give your cappuccino to anybody else and you couldn't take your cappuccino you know a across state lines and you know you go down there's just so yeah\nIt's like buying a cappuccino insofar as it's like buying something but there's a tremendous amount of other stuff that goes into it and I I Can't tell if it's that she's just not smart enough to know that\nOr she used to self righteous and self involved to care\nAnd the end of the law is more effective but you see ... saying the problem is illegal guns that bothers the last ... what I Would I realize more today is that they don't want to ... it's not just at who he is and then

um Obama clip where he\nTalked about or his or when you use the hell he got in the fight than you were mentioning how you know probably didn't happen um who would win and Obama Jeb Bush but\nLike if they stepped into the octagon put on the pads and say that's a really that's a really hard one yeah I mean I'm I'm into energy going on like you were saying this I I think I think Obama problem I think Obama probably takes them I just think\nJeb he's just a wimp and like you know Obama's probably got some ... I think the bottom at it I Know everyone's bowling you right now look I call it like I see it All right I call it like I see it\nI'm trying to think of what would be ... will be some other fun octave octagon UFC style match elsewhere varies by well first of all I mean I think he would take like any Democrat oh heaven or downhill here with all the ... the GOP has got a lot more ringers for the octagon in their in their senior government ranks then uh\nYou know the than anywhere else I mean I can tell you this\nIf it were if it were between Biden let's say and Biden McConnell\nI think would be interesting I probably think that Biden you know fights a little dirty huh but McConnell also has that you don't remember you ever have like your ... you ever get in the wrong side of your grandpa and felt like Rand Paul was kind of old but then he actually grab you know like oh my gosh grandpa was old man's right\nYeah I think that I don't ... yeah I agree with that yeah do you have to do\nThe turtles journals are all about surprised yeah snapping turtles look all slowing cute until you has been a finger that's how McConnell fights\nLower ... he'd be all methodical and\nBite and you know\nI think so I think that's a fair point so we should do we'll records like it was like oh these two politicians gotta gotta fight who who would come out on the ... oh you know be a great one cruise in ... oh yeah cruiser award because we've got a ... swamped by clock we've got to start one\nSwamp fight club absolutely do you think about this though Cruz took Jimmy Kimble to school and the basketball court just took him to school\nAnd Kimmo was really who's calling them a lot and if you see some of the video it was really trying hard and civil thought he was going to win cruise but you know what cruise all about the fundamentals do just like he's all about the constitution when it comes to law when it comes to basketball Cruz is all about like boxing out and I bet you in like a wrestling match\nCruise would go with like straight out of the book like double lake takedown armed bar you know half Nelson he probably studies all the maneuvers yeah\nYou know whereas beta unless unless he can you know knocked back a six pack and get a new car beforehand I don't think he's too dangerous man whoa yeah All right now you go I think the only way that yeah go ... when he got that

you know plus the supermarkets takeaways a you know teach a delivery places have I got\nIn a governments would their uh their attempt to ... for a ... cautious and of course unfortunately whenever there was talk of going to be the crisis fingers get pointed at the United states and say we don't want to be like them\nOr are we going to teach a certain way and this I think it's not just going to apply to a pizza buckets going to apply to a almost\nTake portions labeled nine hundred and twenty calories\nIn any take away all should which would kind of restrict I think also the McDonald's menu and and and and so on and so forth [noise] um so it's it's it's ... it's been the subject of quite a lot of shapes over the last twenty four hours in the end but unfortunately I'm it's entirely

tell you I it's amazing to me or I shouldn't say it's amazing it's noteworthy to me that the first lady of the United states who's an immigrant to this country a very successful legal immigrant to this a country\nThat the first lady age or has a better understanding really the first lady has a better understanding of rule of law due process and the presumption of innocence than about Ninety percent of the mainstream media\nShe's like yeah I stand with women but like show some evidence you know we gotta have we got to have evidence I Know people who say oh but most of the time it's just an act it's just an accusation and well the truth is\nThose accusations are generally anchored by the place the time the reality of whether those people had had any contact were they in the same region within the same city are you know there are there are allegations in their allegations\nYou know if I say that I uh met with somebody who was part of some international conspiracy Thirty years ago I Can't tell you where or when but it happened\nThat's a lot less convincing that last week I met with a guy named Bob who is part of some big international conspiracy we met you know next to the Washington Monument and this was a time of day\nBecause by adding those details even if I'm just making that allegation it at least provides a context and it makes it either provable or disapproval theoretically prove or disprove will whereas if it's on more by the time or place you can't\nYou can't just prove it that's why the Ford allegations and I vote that's at Ford was a very disturbed person I mean I think the blog for probably has had\nAll kinds of terrible things happen to her I think she probably was a ... almost certainly was sexually assaulted I just\nThink almost certainly uh she is making up but it was Brett Kavanaugh or at least she's wrong about it being Brett Kavanaugh which would not be that strange for people with a thirty five year a memory gap so or thirty five years ago and memory gaps\nIn that show here here we have this the first lady talking about the me too movement and and ... cents while talking about the me too movement and then we also have what does not make sense in this whole me too movement or what what does take things\nFor beyond the realm of what any normal person uh would would be willing to say or think about an issue Victoria, BC shell brown got published in the Washington Post\nAnd\nThat the Washington Post would publish this I mean they consider themselves a serious newspaper okay they they think of themselves is probably the second most serious newspaper in the country only does it you know only in the\nNumber two slot for the New York times but they're a D.C based and so I'm sure they believe that they're even better than the times on a whole bunch of issues anyway\nHer piece is as follows quote same or this is a professor or a college professor right in the Washington Post thanks for not raping us all you good men but it's not enough\nLet me take you a little bit into this piece my friend's quote I yelled at my husband last night not pick up your socks yell not how could you ignore that red light yell this was really yelling this was thirty minutes from the gut yelling\nTriggered by a small thoughtless dismissive annoyed patronizing comment\nReally small a microwave that triggered a hurricane I blew

you are sanctimonious all the time but you really just want to\nHave people treat you better ... which is that\nThis woman went into what I think you can call full on Harvey mode against her husband I think that's fair to say screaming at him more than she's ever screamed and before over what she says where they thoughtless comment and she thought she was channeling the anger of all women and\nThen a whole piece by the way is about\nHow it's not enough to just not attack but it's not enough to just treat women will not be a sexist you have to form a male pro feminist movement\nThis just classic progressive social justice theory I Would know they say this about racism to it's not enough to just not be a racist personally you are responsible for historical racism has a white male and therefore you must actively work against that oh that means being a progressive\nDoesn't it but I I really tell you to read this piece thank you for not raping us good men but it's not enough and get a real window into the mindset\nOf these radical deeply unhappy deeply troubled so called\nFeminists [noise] everyday I start the same way with a delicious hot cup of black rifle coffee [noise]\nThis is so
