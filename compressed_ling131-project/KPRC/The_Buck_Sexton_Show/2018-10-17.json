I thought he was going to be a strong leader instead he's ... and let letting these people letting these autocrats letting these tyrants\nKilled journalist and the light of day here we are\nAll the sanctity moaning and blather complete blather\nFrom these two pompous overpaid over coughed clowns MSNBC they don't know a damn thing about what they're talking about oh what because because dad was secretary of state I'm supposed to listen to what she has to say\nI don't think so I\nWasn't a good secretary of state for what that's worth was actually pretty terrible at it but discussion for another time\nAnd Joe ... when I say whose team is he on\nI Know the answer is on Joe's team it's oh it's all about Joe it's all about Scarborough himself he doesn't represent any ideology doesn't represent any set of principles he doesn't even represent being a journalist use just they're just spout off\nAnd make sure he's Harris swooped up as high as possible you know come down with the swooping the rock band Joe it's a little weird\nAnd you can tell they're trying to make this personal they're trying to they're trying to personally goad the president of the United states on this issue\nWhat is she really going to do folks what what message is he going to send the Saudis on this one that would show that would so dramatically changed their minds that would\nAll of a sudden mean they would never do this again or they would think twice about doing is going what are we really going to do this is not a U.S citizen this was knocked down on us soil the Saudis let's write this down to what it is the Saudis kill the guy on\nThe soil of another country in a conflict is it disgusting and barbaric yes do the Saudis do disgusting ... all the time absolutely\nThat is nothing new\nWhy is this our problem I keep hearing about how what what what is Trump going to do what is Trump going to do\nWhat could you do and why is it on him\nShouldn't is we don't we have a United Nations for exactly this purpose don't we have the international\nCommunity that I hear so much about all the time so there can be multilateral and concerted\nAction you saw a book but they won't do anything yeah exactly they won't do anything we're all day\nBut when they when they don't like what the US is doing it's oh why don't you wait for the international community it's it's better if it comes from from all nations United together oh what about this issue well no that's not wait for the United community of nations to come together let let's have the u._s.\nDo what I have to say ... the the\nFrenzy the frenzy that the media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story in the country\nAnd just skip over what's\nGoing on with us troops for example in Afghanistan and place we're still at ... at which we are still in war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or they don't want to they they don't talk about that anymore or they\nWant to focus on this issue and I would say it's not just because\nThey do feel journalist do feel a special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them not so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalist and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy Capra which you know a damn ideas\nSaying that that you are really the best this administration is the best messenger on that issue yeah that's\nOoh talk talk talk talk to the Obama administration which used the Espionage Act more than every other business ration combined not a lot of talk about how they're destroying the first amendment though right not not much of that you hear that about Trump all the time\nBecause he tweets because he tweets it is\nA this journalist to show the what happened to them we still don't really know and we should not lose sight of that we don't know what happened to the show we have not been told what the facts or this case they're still trying to figure it out\nBut everyone wants Trump to take action they they want to push the president I'd states the leader of the free world\nTo do something that could upset the balance of power in the middle East that could have long term ramifications and they don't care about any of that what they really just want is the opportunity to criticize the president for inaction and then dump all over him for whatever action he takes\nThese people are disgusting or disgrace none other than chief national\nSecurity propagandist for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes takes this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump it's all Trump's fault somehow everything that the left doesn't like is Trump's fault play sixteen\nAnd met with President Trump is sending is it there is no consequences and what you have to realize is there's nobody else who can play the role the United states the whole people like this to a ...\nAnd we are the world's oldest and most significant democracy and we're not ... if we're not setting up for this there's not somebody else is going to do that and the consequences of that are journalists everywhere are less safe\nAnd and let's face it we have a president says there are also the state so for a values like freedom of speech and dissent\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world\nThat's in line that I think it's getting much worse\nThat is a giant pile of crap a giant pile of crap from Obama's chief national security propagandist\nA guy who laughed about creating an echo chamber of idiot almost entirely Democrat\nJournalists during the Obama years to sell the Iran deal lasted they're ignorance in their stupidity at least on that he was right they do have a lot of idiot journalist that these media outlets especially the young ones were right out of college who have just bought\nInto this left this nonsense hook line and sinker but notice how far this goes into this is trumped arrangement syndrome on the world stage\nAte a Saudi hit team kills a Saudi journalist in a consulate in Turkey and it's\nOn it's on Trump to make this right it's on us to make this right let me tell you something as someone who has spent more time than he ever thought he would\nIn war zones alongside men and women who were wearing the uniform to defend his country and you essentially rebuild other people's countries for them I don't think we have to make everyone else's problems are problems all the time\nYou know Saudi Arabia is a terrible show radical kingdom that we have to deal with because of the realities of the world we live in\nLook if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home

because we've talked from the beginning of the president can tell about the potential impact on human rights worldwide well that began when journalists I remember vividly it crane trip I buy me a sell out when I talked to a group for ... international\nGrip to protect journalists who told me it was within months of Trump taking office that they thought the worldwide threat to journalists going up and this is kind of the NBA ... dream what is happening now in terms of human right not only to journalists but in several hot spots around the world\nThat's all bull\nThat woman has no idea that MSNBC on which has no idea what you she's talking about I bring to a piece written by yours truly in the age of Trump the ... the press can't stop playing the victim\nYeah I actually looked at the numbers you know the and the committee to protect journalists and all that stuff who wants to get how many journalists have been killed in America since Nineteen Ninety two\nEleven eleven\nHow many people in this country since Nineteen Ninety two\nAlright stretching back now for all you know going\nOn three decades those is what is it eight six to eight Eighteen twenty six years\nFor almost Thirty years how many people have been killed in this country we're journalists and he wanted to guess three\nThree people have been killed for journalism in America in Thirty years and not by the state but just by people that didn't like the journalist doing stories on them\nAnd when you look at the numbers abroad I'm not saying there aren't bad states and they're on July ... regimes but they've been bad\nAll along they've been battle on\nMy way of comparison we've\nHad three journalist killed in twenty six years in this country you know how many cab drivers were killed last year sixty you don't see cab drivers are going oh my gosh we can't do our jobs oh\nJournalist this journalist wine that I hear about oh Trump has made it harder for Jewish how the entire journalist apparatus\nThis country's a gets against him and the ratings are going up and they're more famous than ever they're making more money there is no action being taken against them because Trump makes fun of them you hurt their feelings\nBecause Trump calls out Jim Acosta for being the clown that he is anytime anything anywhere happens to a journalist in the entire world it's Trump's for [noise]\nI mean these are the same people that believe that lives with war and is actually a Native American even after she showed her date DNA results which showed she is not a Native American\nI have a tough time or journalists delusional or they just not very smart [noise] not sure which one [noise]\nAmerican Made and unless I'm or not to buy both my two or three treason Texas Texas lone stars the company I Would tell you to call if you're buying a new home or if you need to refinance your own seven one three eight oh two oh six\nSix seven hundred three eight oh two oh six ... six it's been Twenty years I've been sending people to them that I've been sending people to them if you're buying a home I like um seven one three eight oh two\nSix oh six are you an independent electrical contractor [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nSaid we're going to get to the bottom of [noise]\nWe need to know who was responsible way due to all those\nBut it was a member of a free and independent breath [noise] any loss of life is grievance any act of violence planes alive is [noise]\nUh [noise] this was also\nAssault on free and independent press so\nWorld deserves answers\nThat those responsible are held to account\nNow that's the vice president who's saying\nPretty much all the things you would expect him to say I think he's saying the right things here on this issue\nUm but the leftist critics of the regime of the administration sorry that happens sometimes\nThey're not placate or by this at all they're not okay they don't say oh All right you know because Penn says we just need the facts and will hold them accountable they're not they're not slowing down all they want to jump all over\nThat their plan they want to jump all over the president and the vice president on this issue as much as they can and they're not waiting for anything they don't wait for the fact that in a wait to see what action he takes day just\nPrefer this notion that you know Trump is a bad guy that helps them sleep and one other thing though I I Would disagree with vice president Pence on on one matter or the notion of this is an attack\nOn an independent press okay well he would write for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an independent press at all not not even a little bit okay there there is not an independent press inside of your people say oh buckets been getting a little\nBit and reads yeah whatever turkey doesn't have an independent press in fact the country workers Shelby was from what we see from what we believe murdered\nIs one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press freedom so when\nWe say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is the exception not the rule lotta countries have all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared\nAll right so does any mass of people that shows up at the border now get to come in the United states why do we even have immigration laws why do we have a border patrol\n... what is the purpose of all this\nIf lives are just going to grandstand every time and act like anyone who has any questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she oh Timothy here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrat socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrat socialist year as we know fences and others Elizabeth Warren but she's got other problems right now\nThe problem that the Democrats socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state\nThat doesn't work at doesn't add up and also people are willing to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their polity right their political union\nThere is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say where you\nWant to you know I I Want to help Americans first if we're gonna have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans all races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck we're gonna have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up\nAnd has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking to people that's generally that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh the jobs here are\nBetter well guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're going to put my button on a plane and kick me out of the country never let me back and I was going to feel sorry for me\nThere is an order that country's try to maintain\nOther countries are allowed to have borders not only that other countries are not expected to take in millions and millions and tens of millions\nOf people from a different culture who speak a different language and who once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way all of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to be part of the American family legal immigrants overwhelmingly do but I Do see a trend among illegal immigrants\nWhere do they think that we owe them something we owed them not just citizenship noxious permanent residency but also all the goodies that the state can offer free health care free school free housing free everything\nEven America with are incredible economy and our economic dynamism and thank you Trump for showing us that growth\nGrowth under Obama for all the people are saying well I'm a ... show great growth under Obama in his last year in office was like one point something\nPercent growth on her Trump's second year in office GDP over four percent\n\nSingle best measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country songs that go beyond the car I mean we're though the please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made a slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet print in like the time not somebody who had to run a business of any time you know he was in the business of Obama different\n[noise]\nBut the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in the way of the left is narrative with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to be in a position\nWe can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them in and we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but if if their claims of asylum allow them entry in this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up in this country\nAnd we are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all this required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that are coming into this country no that all they have to say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country as a sign especially for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nOr because we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's not supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world and that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way\nThey understand or they understand that quite honestly there is no way that they can\nExplain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans would ever\nWould have a lot of folks would say oh what a second I don't think that's going to work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that have been in this country for centuries now a joined this community that now liberals speak to specifically be illegal immigrants in this country the quote on documented joined the ranks of the aggrieved undocumented\nAnd try to get them access to the public treasuries fast as possible\nWe are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is not actually making our economy stronger that is why\nIt's an obvious lie if Americans are not\nBalancing the budget the of the year for the American people are actually paying as they go when it comes to government spending we really think that bringing a lot of foreigners who don't have skills who aren't going to remember I'm Talking about illegal foreigners\nThey're going to be the ones that set the economy right I don't think so\nI Know you know these two men as it frustrating it is frustrating that you're going to hear so much is going to turn into one big media sob story to all who would drawing these people who would turn these people away\nHow could you so heartless you know Republicans with your [noise] your top hats and your monoculture stepping over poor people in the way to work [noise] it's great [noise]\nUh we will talk about was born [noise] Pocahontas or she is called bar president that's coming up\nBackground checks or central no matter what size business you're in you're going to make sure that you've got people coming in who have represented themselves properly to you don't have any criminal issues in their background when every major financial issues and a lawsuit against them that's where [noise]\nAnd he's doing whatever he can to get that done and that's his legacy as a conservative he knows you know he said what you will about Mitch and the swamp and all that stuff he has been a warrior for conservative judges getting on the bench\nGetting the highest courts as we know with cabin on elsewhere that's at stake though here if the Democrats were to take control the Senate you could say goodbye to getting any good judges through\nIf the Democrats take control the Senate it's going to be a complete stoppage on federal judges in less you'd put forward America Garland type and anyone who you think might be kind of a centrist according to the way the media describes him trust me that judges are leftist so you might\nGet somebody like America Carlin do come through and uh but overall though well bring it to a screeching halt so so at ... at some level there's there's a judge issue at stake here or judges are at stake with the midterms I think we're good on that and the Senate side\nBut then you go to the house side of the equation you realize that\nWe will be subjected to ... a stoppage of Trump's most important policy agenda items if the Democrats take the house it will be over\nYou know maybe they'll play a little poodle foot sea with our side when it comes to an infrastructure bill but it's it's over in terms of getting a wall immigration reform oh that that's not going to happen\nAnd we're going to be in a two year long grinding battle\nWhere all the media is going to want to do is try to exact revenge on Trump and all of his supporters for the humiliation that they've in New York at the media's in Georgia for the last\nCouple of years you'll be treated you the most politicized and nonsensical investigations imaginable and you will see\nSure enough that yeah they're going to make this about about impeachment even if they know they can't remove the president they want to impeach him just to put a stain on his presidency that they can Venus you try to run someone and twenty twenty now the good news\nFor us is that the Democrats so far have nobody\nRealistic that they can run against Trump for twenty twenty I mean it's this list that that I saw earlier this week that CNN had the polling on on who could be who could be up against wrong I mean you at at the top list Joe\nBiden come on guys why didn't that the best you can do\nBelow by new had boring I don't think she's exactly going to be a threat I don't think I don't think Warren's got it or you had some other names on there and you know ... Kamala Harris why because she checks\nThem boxes that the left likes nothing nothing that you've ever seen or do legislatively or otherwise I was impressive\nAnd I've I've heard from people that it was someone on her staff I don't know this but the rumor that and I'm reporting on a rumor I Know you can yell at me later rumors that someone on her staff not Feinstein staff that actually that information I don't have proof of that I'm not naming anybody obviously because I don't have proof of it but that was what I heard and that wouldn't surprise me\nWe have that other staffer a ... a congressional staffer\nWho was leaking the personal information of Republican senators a dachshund them straight up docked and he's facing real time in prison he should go\nBut I I Hope the GOP has had a wakeup call here and that's really what I'm focused on I I Hope that\nRepublicans that every person who voted for Trump understands that all the good things that are happening\nCome to effectively come to a if not a halt let's say they they they continue what half power at best sure they'll still be some executive orders still do that there'll be deregulatory stuff but we lose the house\nYou're going to see that the resistance\nWill dig in and all of the craziness that we've seen them engage in in the last two years old that\nTrump psychosis will be directed into the house of

parents that are like oh what's their agenda going to be oh you know stuff\nRussia collusion style I mean it's just going to be crap\nSo America is really going to suffer so this election ma'am I can say is the most important election of our lifetime ... everyone always says that that's garbage it's an important election though and if you really think the Trump is part of a political revolution and what he's doing is and I really do believe is benefiting this country tremendously we've got to go to the barricades on this when we got\nFight politically speaking we got much more coming up

were like I said there were a few of us on this one\nBut man that was that was a a dark time in this country's history it was the most disgusting most obvious smear effort anybody could have ever imagined and they ... they I keep\nWanting to tell everybody you know yes we should be happy that he got through but they almost got away with it they almost stopped him and we need to remember that too we need to keep it in mind and you know ... they're not done with this either they they haven't decided to let this go\nSo well right now there are a little there are a little bit caught flat footed\nBecause of what this is doing for their electoral prospect right there there's there's something I'm understanding on the left that oh my gosh we we overplayed are had we we made mistakes year we shouldn't have done this the way we did ah that\nThat's real that sentiment in Israel um they also haven't given up on the notion that maybe they'll maybe they will still find a way to get rid of Kavanaugh somehow I mean the the most looney left\nLawmakers the fun of liberation the Muslim unless lawmakers are still out there talking about this and you know what I'm Talking about looney and the

heartbreaking\nI think women are not going to be the women are going to continue to watch what took place in that confirmation and him and he won't rest and if\nHe won't rest easy in his job\nWhat is that supposed to meet you know the the left is willing to go to these extremes whenever they don't get their way\nThey don't like what happens with the Senate maybe we shouldn't have a Senate they don't like what happened to the Supreme Court maybe we shouldn't have a Supreme Court they don't like that it's a five for court maybe we should have eleven people on the ... I mean whatever it is they have no respect for the system whatsoever and left the system gives them what they want\nThey don't view this system as a necessary mechanism for managing our disputes and conflicts in a civil fashion\nThey don't seem to understand that the constitution other than yes grading the basic construct for our government and when it comes to the bill of rights is really just about process sees and things that the government can do to you it doesn't just say the government has\nTo be amazing government has to be wonderful because what does that mean says the government cannot do the following the government must respect the following because we're trying to create a systematic approach to every individual system that the guy ... citizen rather that the government must follow\nBut you see the left because they are both petty totalitarian and status are willing to reform the system however they see fit whenever they see fit may have no shame about this they they have no\nSense of their own hypocrisy because they only do this when they don't get their way they only do this when they don't have the power that they think they deserve [noise]\nI Would just note that this is problematic to say the uh we're going to be more of us come stay with [noise]\nThere are for my wife they do a wonderful job\nAnd they can design for you if you want if it's your thirty

million weaker and other minority at then ... and so called free education can't tensions are being conducted another guy neutralizing extremist ... prisoners are tortured [noise]\nThey are forced to run out of their religion and to pledge allegiance to the Communist Party\nChina is an authoritarian state\nNow I point this out not just as a reminder and also\nAs a moment to taking a moment here to say that if we are concerned about national security threats if we really want to talk about who we need to keep an eye on China is far and away based on population size based on the economy based on its military based on its aggressive\nActs to try and steal our intellectual property in our government and military secrets Sean ... is our only near peer competitor period Russia is not even in the same ball game okay Russia isn't even worth\nTalking about in the same way Russian GDP is one trillion dollars folks okay it's one trillion Chinese GDP as a twenty sixteen was eleven point two trillion dollars okay it is ... is over ten times the size\nOf the Russian economy ten acts okay that that's not a gap that the other the Russians are going to be able to make up for any time soon so the Chinese or the real concern why am I bring this well as we've been discussing here on the show there's a tremendous amount of concern about ... and the Saudis\nAnd I've I've told you why this is all of a sudden everyone's oh my gosh salaries so brutal and so terrible oh God and I'm not saying when they did was brutal terrible was but the Saudis have been brutal and terrible for a long time\nThey are meeting the media using this as an opportunity not just to raise the issue because it's considered one of their own so to speak as a journalist but also as a means of hitting from what I think is so interesting is that if the standard is really that Americans need to be willing\nTo take risks to risk\nTheir own foreign policy interest and everything else based on humanitarian concerns in other countries\nWhat do we do about China what why is it that now we're hearing oh we need to take this really strong line against Saudi Arabia because of what it did hear China's one child policy is more barbaric I Know they've changed it but the China's has engaged in worse\nHumanitarian a repression than really any other country in the world except for North Korea\nAnd that's not something you're hearing much in the press right now because no serious person is really going to say oh yeah let's let's go after China on this issue and let's punish our own economy\nOn a humanitarian one thing to do it for trade one thing to do for our interests but you know the idea of America First means that we're concerned with our own stuff first and foremost we're not playing world police anymore mayor ...\nBook yeah the book like my name and makes it better song\nUm but we're we're really not supposed to be running around telling everybody what I was wondering if we can tell them whatever we want but but trying to force them\nTo act in a certain way because that's all will be doing and we will lose a lot in the process and we probably won't even get what we want in the long run and here here's an example of what I mean\nGoing to take a DNA test all of you have I've been told him my grandmother was part Cherokee enemy Indian it male being just talk\nBut you got to find out in a couple of weeks have families take this new are going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be rebuilt here this is my ... this lie Alan and say well you know I just I'm dying to know [laughter] you know I didn't really think much about it but she is less than one tenth of one\nAnd then I think I can beat her I think I can beat her\nTo banter will us for a million dollars from the president to not want it to the no enemy but [laughter] come back in a couple of weeks of ... really are a problem Iranian they like therapy [laughter] great people just bad leadership bad later\nSo I I like it really ... Lindsey Graham who say they're still the very end I don't uh I like ... he was he didn't read it the way that it's out it I could say that I I he just misspoke a you know he didn't\nMean that he just met or Iran is a bad country Iran is not bad people in fact the Iranians I've had many Iranian friends throughout my life and\nAh it would be a great day to have the Iranian people in Iran able to have the same some of the same freedoms as the a wonderful Iranians that live in this country uh we've had a whole she asked for a running joke anyway\nI Love the other stuff you would say though that I was going to take a DNA test every Lindsey Graham is he's very much a\nVery much a man struck by a kind of knew swagger\n'cause I I think that he really understands\nUh he he really understands that you got to be willing to fight the other side you got to be willing to go to the mad I mean Lindsey and this and it's kind of mirrors my own feelings last few weeks where I've just said last few months\nYou know what as much as as much as I always want to leave the door open for the other side and I want I Want people on the left to listen to the show I Want you know honest good Democrats to listen to the show as much as they're willing to\nUh in terms of the of the ideas we can't just oppose them we we've got to crush the ideas I don't crush people I Want to crush ideas\nAnd that means sometimes yes as a kid say we might have to own the lives a little bit\nOf solidity grandma I liked that he's been oh is that a little more swagger is I've been saying and I also think that you know on on immigration he has some interesting things to say I I\nI got to get him I got to get them a little more a hard line on this stuff folksy here's what he said play click bait\nBarrel Evan main illegal immigrants here that came from burning the poor countries\nWhat do we do with them I Want to ... based immigration system you got to get Democrats and Republicans working together ... control who gets the job for\nLegal immigration moved to ... based immigration you can ignore the eleven man they'll never be a deal right with the Democratic party that does make a deal with the eleven may in her non felons who've been here for twenty and Thirty years once you get them in a good spot even have a new immigration system\nYou know I I don't think you get it on this one yet folks I think that Lindsey\nHe's a little is a little too squishy on this issue as I've been saying thank you Yale University math nerds for backing me up on this it's not eleven million age twenty million it's twenty two zero at least\nI I don't know what we have to do to get people to understand this is not eleven is twenty million at a minimum\nWhich is a vast number of people\nFrom a a generally speaking from one country from Mexico I mean that the vast majority of them are from Mexico\nWhich also happens to be a neighbor of ours geographically with ... with an enormous border and you know it it poses its own issues for political unity in this country really does I Know people are not allowed to national\nSecurity analyst will tell you that when you have a population that has a that has moved across the border that has fought wars over that border we don't often think about that but we fought a war with Mexico over the border and then you have a population that maintains a tremendous\nAnd continue tremendously powerful and continuing ties to the the what's considered the homeland of the mother country\nA ... you have a recipe for stabilization you really do I mean politically at a minimum de stabilization\nAnd that's you know that's something that I think is\nA you know he needs to be remembered here I I think Lindsey Graham is might look I give them a lot of credit for the whole capital thing but as much as\nI'd like to just look at that and say it's all fine now they're going to get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security we'll see what happens with this request for a wall and that's not good enough that's not acceptable\nTo eat unless you've talked a little bit more about this deal that he thinks is going to happen play seven\nHouses have been and a half for the wall I mean excuse me five being in the Senate has been a path\nWill close the gap a duck I remember that ... Ninety thousand kids brought here on the average age of six no place else to go Trump's going to win in court he can repeal dock of the day he went in court what do we do with these young people so I'd like to do a deal for wall funding for ...\nFor wall funding for DACA that ... that I think I think you could sell that to the republic ... if it was full well funny you get that five billion\nAnd it's just deferred action still are it's not a\nA but it can't be it can be citizenship and can't be permanent just okay well we're going to have a we're going to see how this goes it because you can't discuss what you're going to do with the out of Lebanon but twenty million illegals in this country and Jill you have\nA reasonable assurance that you're not going to be dealing with another twenty million in ten years\nAnd if you by the way I understand that the\nPolitical sway that the Latino Democrat community in this country will have for even more a unrestricted immigration particularly from your from South of the border uh that will skew the entire debate and discussion going forward\nAnd all Democrats will see is that they will be importing masses of new voters\nWho will essentially make the Republican Party a you know a an afterthought they will they will be able to turn America into a one party state\nThat's the game the Democrats are flying the Republicans keep thinking about this like well you know maybe we can deal with the Democrats are looking at the immigration issue is how do we make the Republican Party extinct [noise]\nRepublicans rosel maybe there was no\nNo no that idea [noise] very bad idea [noise] she's much more coming up James uh stay right there stay with me [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk\nYou're being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider not only can they record you're browsing history but they often sell it to other corporations who wants to profit from your information\nThat's why I decided to take my privacy backed by using express VPN expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phones and tablets turning on his recipe the antics only one slip and costs less than seven dollars a month\nIs the number one VPN service by tech radar comes with a thirty day money back guarantee you\nProtect your online activity today and found out find out how you can get three months free at express VPN dot com slash bar that express VPN dot com bust buck for three months free with a one year package expressed be the N. dot com slash book\nAsian ... Fox News the president appears to be willing to give the Saudi royal family the benefit of the doubt and any involvement in the disappearance of journalists came off the show\nSome not laughable\nArguments I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native American is is ... laughable to any serious human laughable I mean you should laugh about it\nAt the wall Street Journal said if she is a person of color than words have no meaning she is as far from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kind of ... she used to she still claims do it but then there's this point it will did she receive any benefit my friends there is so much circumstantial evidence that she received benefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school she was then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsider to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens\nIn last the hiring committees think that they can while they can but it's very important to them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty that's a big big deal for them they have their pick they can have anyone they want and that's why I also\nWhy would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nIt must have gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief it's completely ridiculous I can\nTell you that I spoke to because I have access to a lot of Democrats at the hill or and I spoke to Democrats today who our colleagues and I got to say there were all\nThey were all say it as soon as this is just there's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it that she thought that this prove their case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more to it on the sea rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete is total from [laughter]\n[laughter] sometimes referred to as ... as he has defeated really progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great on force political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nUh but then the president had this thing today later on then I got to say I don't know what's going on here I I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president on policy among fighting back absolutely\nBut what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about a ... horse Oh yes\nHere's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and her third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm you know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is a lie start to finish\nAnd I have thought that ah that that there is no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and wanted nothing there's nothing criminal about anything that's even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels ah or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic that no no shot no chance\nUm but I gotta say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jumped to the conclusion that Trump actually has had this affair with her\nUm ... what what I said I shouldn't say jumping to conclusions I think that's obvious but why are we so sure\nA lot of people in those seem very very short about it I I'm I'm just I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of meaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair\nShe just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this her whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ...\nAnd degrading and nasty toward toward the president so I'm you know I I had thought that the president this was before he was the president I have thought that maybe he and I had strayed from his marital out here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um especially because it's you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrats but there's also part of me the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they're all focused on the present referring to a woman as a horse race\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week in this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say buttons that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all going to be great\nSo that that's a part of it too and maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAre among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still be wanted to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's\nYeah that's a little that's a little bit beneath where where our presidents or B that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect it's pretty darn good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians you know it's not perfect me pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nLook can be Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I said let me tell you why I say that instead of just said and I let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why I give Trump a lot of leeway why I caught this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe or it's going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked all the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was as a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year he's making plenty of money she's got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that\nBut I I won't hormone or too much fucking Ron Paul did it for a little bit that was interesting he served as a big lead ... [noise] and we'll be right back [noise]\nEight oh two oh six oh six seven hundred three eight oh two oh six those six it's been Twenty years I've been sending people to them that I've been sending people to them if you're buying a home I like um seven one three eight oh two\nOh six oh six\nI talk to my Ford still find your best deal ever bring our twenty fifth anniversary get twenty thousand off ... on a new twenty Eighteen F. one fifty thousand I forgot where [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that is that\nWhat am I got as a cloud has very aware of what's going on on that land they got a pack sell it different kinds of Congress his hand and I got her and my ... year old and an actor yeah a lot that has the activated San ... she ran into her little girl her ...\nHer head she wasn't ... and my daughter down [laughter]\nLet's turn\nAnd you know at a you know she came home and cry planned well wow this is a is specifically\nLiberal problem and and I I don't ever like to be mean or even to silly lips and I don't like to marketing with family and I certainly would never mock\nA twelve year old girl or twelve year old boy twelve year old anybody\nUm that's not cool that's not nice it's not fair and it's a on becoming\nSo I'm not commenting on a twelve year old as somebody with strong opinions and who goes home from school and cries about them that's that's not of any interest to me whatsoever with is of interest to me is that that was a clip\nOf Maggie June ... the actress on the view\nAnd she seems to think that it is not just normal but expected for a twelve year old to be quote an act of asked\nKids should be allowed to be kids and the only way that a a normal child\nWould feel the need to come home and cry\nBecause that young girl met another girl who did not self described as a feminist is because of the parents are engaging in a really relentless\nPropaganda campaign toward their own children\nNow parents can raise kids with whatever believes they want but I I Would just note that I think that they're doing a disservice I think that anyone does a disservice to a very young person by ... really instilling in um a radical leftist belief\nAnd not letting them keep an open minded and develop their own beliefs but I also think that increasingly parents these days and just adults in general in America who our lives who are liberals have absolutely no perspective on these issues they they have no ability\nTo stand back and try to be a little objective their purpose other kids and you know letting their kids come to their own beliefs and not feel familial pressure to take certain positions because even as an adult\nYou should always be testing and retesting your assumptions maybe you're someone who's going to be politically active it's essential to think how I changed my mind\nWhat what evidence could be shown that would lead me to change my mind\nWhy do I not agree with the other side is there anything that could change that would make me agree with the other side and my shore I'm right about what I think and believe on every issue", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
