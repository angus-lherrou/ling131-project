going to show up to\nAt what point you realize you no longer have a legal immigration system worthy of the name you just have a country that has porous and he just to find a way to get into one of

laugh it really drives me absolutely insane that they're never forced to answer the question who shouldn't be allowed to stay\nIf you show up and you look like you're sad and tired and an hungry and needy from a country that's in bad shape and I'm not saying no that's all that's all very valid but if you shop for one of those countries do just automatically get to stay because then we've got a few hundred million people that I think really deserve to be an America right away\nAnd Democrats won't admit this but they're unwilling to tell all those people you do not get to stay in this country

stopped on the river crossing\nBy the U.S space Spanish language network Telemundo\nSome members of the caravan became so desperate they jumped from the bridge trying to grab onto the makeshift rafts other migrants were using the cross rubber New Mexico\nUh unbelievable site on the Mexican border tear gas rocks being thrown caravan wants to enter not able to right now it's rooted Telemundo anchor Jose Diaz Balart\nUh the network which has trout reporters traveling with the caravan showed Mexican police lined up along the fence holding up against the waves of migrant trying to push past I mean this this is\nWhat this is a mob I mean this is a mob but we can call it whatever they're people that are needy that are hungry that\nYou know want to be in America I get that but this is a massive people and they're trying to overwhelm the border that's what this is we cannot process the mall we cannot deal with them all they know this and so they show up and this is really using our humanitarian impulses in this country against us\nAnd that's um you know you either believing sovereignty believe in law and order or you don't\nAnd I know it's so easy to say just taken everybody but just remember that as you look at what's going on and a lot of communities that have had\nTremendous financial strain put on them by the resettlement of illegal immigrants by ... ... refugees that's just going to keep getting to be greater and greater\nIt's a function of mathematics books you cannot have open borders in a welfare state and we have a very big welfare state and something very very

I I think that is what they say oh that the process for some they're all from Honduras well we know they're going to say you know where to hundreds is very violent we don't wanna go back we just want to be in America okay and you say All right ... well\nYou know we've got one for four thousand more people yes of course we've got run for when you say rooms but what does that really mean\nYeah we've got the space is late we've got a lot of open spaces country but people need resources and they have you know they want they want political representation they it's it's not just to be in a place it's also to be supported in that place say okay but we got obviously were very wealthy country got enough for four thousand okay fine\nWhat about the next ten thousand not all of that that that's not no I Would want to ask Democrat members of Congress asked\nDemocrats senators what do we do in the next gang that shows up is I don't mean gangs and like gang bangers but you know what I mean the next or a group that X massive they call it a caravan right this is the tournaments as they try to use ... what do we do in the next caravan shows up of of ten thousand people\nOkay we got we got to let them in\nDoing letting the next ten caravans of ten thousand people each after that\nWhy would anybody why would anybody wait\nYears in years pay thousands of dollars and deal with all kinds of annoying headaches and I know they're not it's not fun and a lot of times it's not fair why do that if all you have to do is show up in Mexico\nWalk to the border and say I'm fleeing a very dangerous situation in my home country well what were your papers while I'm undocumented\nI Can't prove that well even speak Spanish no no I don't know how do I know you're from Honduras or you don't but why don't we figured out the immigration courts let me into America oh I get my court\nDate in four years great I'll be sure to show up for that one see then\nWhy would anyone waste their time right that this is the way to do it just go to Mexico show up at the border but show up in a big group because the optics of it which is what they're playing off of here are oh we can't turn away this big group that looks really mean\nNow we're going to have a well we don't want to look mean immigration policy every other country in the world has a we don't want to look mean immigration policy or rather they're willing to have a we will look\nMean immigration policy that don't tell people you get 'em in\nEvery other countries there's no sorry you know just get to come and stay here and say well you know America is different alright there's there are other wealthy country should there are plenty of places people could go\nPlenty of countries they could go to um people in Honduras and wonderfully Honduras they could very easily head south and go to Columbia they could go to other countries that are not a nearly as violent right now and obviously there's a lot of violence in Venezuela but not nearly as violent is what's going on and Honduras\nMore ...\nSince Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy has slowed down complex commercials or ... depending on

do you miss her GED we wanted to give you a little mom does the so you remember what it was like when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise]\nAh yes Hillary you've probably think to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary is run for president unsuccessfully twice there is no way that she would be show diluted and\nSo self involving so self important and Meg woman article that\nShe would run again but all I Do listen to that ... and fellow sometimes on the radio it can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year\nRegularly that Hillary Clinton may run again and I keep saying I Know everyone can say I'm Crazy\nI Know everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but oh guess what a you know it's got my first time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top\nA Clinton aide Felipe rains who's a veteran spokesmen and console year they are saying that yes it's a it's\nPossible here's resent his political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational or an form of formal polling as eight twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is it that she's run before this would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her\nIt was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen\nShocking last up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification she is smarter than most tougher than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt\nWhen asked about the like that ever running range responded is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not\nZero now let me tell you something right now\nAre there is a very very higher than zero much more realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about a ... that she will run and that's why they're starting it's as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting want what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary wonder if I'm selling all along there's an entire apparatus of people around her who believed that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they\nI have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their officers they were ready to\nGo and that was all taken from they believe taken from them by the Russians I they believe taken from them by this uh this\nUnholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative is I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes it will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for her Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary\nBut this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that the case for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational in the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they\nJust you know what it is they just can't stomach it they just feel like they had to adjust show down a lot of nasty\nStuff in order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it and there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may\nHave to do it again and they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance to Hillary Clinton runs right now you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of twenty five percent\nI'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious\nShot that she decides to run and mad wouldn't that just pure while\nWe can replay twenty six you know election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over again [noise] I mean I'm I'm a I'm not sure if people would know it would be a ... it would be a ratings bonanza and the good news is folks that\nWhy why why would someone who lives about his drinking and\nHe didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his drinking he said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when\nYou start to try to play around with well look it's not too much like way way too much such a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did not live at a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that you would drink too much sometimes\n... the Democrats went so far is to try to put high school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop cap and it was pathetic which goes to show that they have no scruples\nNothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all in all\nThis stuff but that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said to them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nYou would never occur to me and I know never heard of any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them because of what they stand for publicly when it ... it just would never occur to me\nNow I'm not saying to talk to somebody to engage somebody and if you wasn't elected representatives governor but this is yelling this is heckling this isn't there are trying to have a conversation I'm sure this is not\nMeant you in any way be constructive they're not engaging Ted Cruz they're mouthing Ted Cruz this is what they do they like the foreign mobs\nBut also reminded me when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there but you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assault\nAnd that's\nIf if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves support and sympathy\nBut that created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of will eat it because something\nBad happened to me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges or because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in the third person it means that this this case should be influenced\nBy that that's\nThat's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you imagine if I had a\nUh I I was on trial for a steely right I was in ... for fraud and people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the left it was\nA widespread talking point the whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too are there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come forward and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh\nDoes not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not\nThis is really elementary stuff and that this was something that people are losing sight of and a lot of people are losing sight of just I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize this entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass hysteria in this country that Democrats have\nReached this point where I don't think that the king ah logically about many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want your show rage and they want to signal ... due to the world\nAnd they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect that other people will listen to that other people here are their thoughts and because especially on the left there's so much claiming a victim status now whenever and saying oh I'm of victims you have to listen to me\nAh their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from the identity of the particular speaker of the justification that becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality and to bring this back with Trump is saying here you know do you want\nPeople who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are electing representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and you know there's been not nearly enough condemnation\nOf the kinds of tactics that the left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know there's been a lot of endorsing of it but it's been not nearly\nA enough and I find that a fund that\nDisquieting to St Louis so there yeah but you know working talk disquieting\nStupid celebrities are all over the place you know there's all kinds of dumped celebrities everywhere oh you're a Christian or Christian or whatever bell\nSaying that Snow White is a cartoon character that gives her or is this story fairy tale that a troubleshooter now because of the lack of consent 'cause you know she gets kids while she's asleep in a coma from the magic spell I didn't think people are trying to dig any of this ah literally\nUm but it turns out it turns out I may be wrong on that when it turns out that ah that there are people who take fairy tales literally um but if we're going to talking about celebrities who\nI I don't know how it is that they are treated with as much respect\nWhen it comes to politics that they are um but you know we've got to get into a ... Rosie Rosie O'Donnell coming up here in in just a moment Rosie O'Donnell who has some thoughts to share with you but I'm not sure you want to hear but uh you'll hear I'm All right oh I you know we're\nTalking about a feminism and and how toxic it is later on the show but I just thought this is a funny clean next this is just a quick quick throwaway\nSee what I did there quick throwaway Kleenex is re branding its man sized tissues as extra large after complaints of sexism that just broke today\nYou can't have meant sized issues anywhere folks there are only ... tissues now because it is sexist that's right they say it is sexist to call tissues men size now is it sexist or refer to someone's large hands as men hands like in that Seinfeld episode I assume it is to\nHave a special counsel that was completely fabricated by a collusion between the media and the Democrats the takedown of presidents he didn't have that you didn't have senior government officials including the deputy director and director of the F or former director deputy of the FBI\nWho abuse their power and could have you been facing criminal charges because of the extent of that abuse you didn't have during the Obama administration federal government employees who were willing to leak highly sensitive information in violation of the law in violation of their oaths their ethics\nAt in order to smear\nSenior Obama administration officials okay you did not have anything even close to a deep state or a\n... and yet even with all that people will not have found it in the least bit funny to have made a joke about how Obama was you know the\nMilitary should've deposed hamburger should have been martial law white isn't what is Rosie O'Donnell even get to sit on MSNBC and have this discussion and what does she have to bring to the table she's eight eight comedian slash actress who says incredibly ignorant things about politics all the time\nIt she's given his platform and ... it's hard to say on M. S. N. B. C. C. even radio sometimes you stumble yeah stumble it happens um but she's given I suppose they would say because she has a following\nBut man you want to talk about corrupting people's minds here a lot of political talk from from Rosie O'Donnell that's that's not to start encouraging to me at least not not in the least\nOh and also we want to talk about corruption mine's Cory Booker who thinks he's going to run for president in this country likes to talk about how great things are in Canada right now that's not a surprise played up that\nThis was your [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\nOne one of the\nOne of the reasons why we\nYeah explain why they're doing all those things Cory Booker because they're not maybe you should stick to the silly speeches like I Am Spartacus and leave the the arising about investment and growth and industry and\nResearch and development to people watch you know what the heck they're talking about uh you know there\nThere's a reason why people from all over the world by the way I Want to come to university here we're not Americans aren't like yes some of the university somewhere else\nThat's not how it goes everybody wants to come here so I Do think college is too expensive there there is a a component of this where it's what the market will bear folks are and then he talked about recent development out American and us\nWhich is that even meet in in what way\nIt's just these are the things that Democrat politicians say because it sounds smart to not very smart people I don't know that can be kind of harsh but it's true\nIt's true the Trump approaches just to say very straightforward basic things to people that they know to be true to talk to them like normal people and they get it they're on board and then to take action based upon those commonsense things\nI I much prefer that to the kind of poll tested you know out America getting America or whatever oh my gosh Cory Booker only slightly better chances of\nRunning the residency and twenty twenty than [noise] than Hillary Clinton I say of or or than Elizabeth Warren lose warned not Hillary definitely running before the war and run so that tells you about how good was orange and he's a [noise] ... [noise]\n\n\nThat was you know because when it comes to the place we saw was tough [noise]\nLast\nYear he ... he's a boy scout and that's signed a little boring [noise]\nTheory wanting to buy things that again right\nI get it he wanted an Indian woman [noise]\nFederal is one failed her DNA has [noise]\nActually when the president found out that I was in the in there and then he asked me if I was in the same tribe that was the\n\n... I think that's what the kids say wrecked at is I I smell I smell burnt toast so they say when I play basketball when somebody would go by you in school I smell burnt toast um or broken ankle I heard that ankle break you know but\n... is another version of that Nikki Haley there at the Al Smith dinner\nAnd talking about the Elizabeth Warren just I don't know I mean the Elizabeth Warren maneuver earlier this week I Know we've talked about a lot about going to get much more into it now but that was the equivalent the political equivalent of being the incredibly Sean burned\nPudgy kid who in front of everybody up like the summer pool\nJust decides to go into the deep end get up on the high dive and first first time just goes for without telling mom and dad and just as one of those belly flop memory sunburn you know the belly flop when you hear in seat and just go oh I like it it hurts you\nTo watch it and it makes that black sound that only the really bad embarrassing\nBelly flop can make that's the that's politically what Elizabeth Warren duty or you're just like oh my gosh what is wrong with you\nAnd she and I got caught up in a too but you should have gone back and seeing the the coverage they had on new day it's on his ... yeah I Know I Would argue with the CNN exec on Twitter and they got turned into a few new stories of the few places because\nFuck don't play if she wants to try to try to bring the rockets they better they better come correct as they say because I Am not I'm not going to surround who do\nYou sure you go to ... and please\nI Know what goes on over there have been over there um but but you know you look at a you look at what happened with war this week and she you know when they started their coverage of it was just you know you had Alison\nCamera like June results have been drop that sure\nOh yeah the results show that lives with word can't do math or isn't very smart or both or or is just I think\nI think delusional if that's probably the most likely outcome there but Nikki Haley did a good job at the Al Smith dinner and it\nWas she had some great opportunities there and she took them with with some good jokes and I do think that her move all long hair has been she's good with cheese in good with the Trump people she's going to help Donald Trump when the second term she is a perfect candidate to run a once Trump has had a second term I I don't people are saying pants\nI don't know about that I don't see parents at the at that level but I've I've been wrong before as as everybody who tries to make these kinds of productions\nUs being a British as I did say at least on rising earlier this week that a minute you would not go Steven Mnuchin the treasury secretary would not go to Saudi Arabia after what happened with ... we don't have really much of a new developments on that I Would note\nThere are still people who are spending a lot of time covering the story but there's not\nA lot out there in terms of\nNew verifiable are facts and I've got to say um you know that's it's just going to be at the end exactly what I thought which is that these the Saudis are going to say that this was a rogue operation um but\nUp on Trump was clearly what a lot of this has been about all along and I you know and and Bernie Sanders sometimes I get a little caught up it was like you know we ... you know he was like\nAnd when you say this to people who don't care what a person's raises don't judge them by their skin color and\nLove a lot of women in their lives and treat women with dignity all the time and are completely respectful of the women they just started to tune out all the rest of it because it's cheap\nIt's dishonest at this as a line of attack against Trump and against everybody around him is just going for the lowest common denominator and its mudslinging and place of ideas mudslinging and in place of policy I I had I had to laugh without one I don't even know was with competition like\nThey're kicking ... full of let's say liberal ... of it I'm just like like my church right now are real\nIt's like why are they doing this to me I Wish that they would also get a little bit more of a sense of humor a sense of humor that didn't revolve around mocking and ridiculing uh Christians and a white males all the time\nI mean white males we can take it up and the stuff about Christians that they do is particularly a nasty you know that's really it's not meant to be laughing with its laughing at all the time\nBut liberals don't have a sense of humor anymore\nAnd this is why you see these polls about political correctness and how anybody who's paying attention to it was a political correctness is a cancer in our society\nIt is destructive it doesn't add anything to society doesn't make us better as as people it just creates a incentives to make politics all about personal destruction and also allows some of the most\nAnnoying stone faced on happy miserable petty people in our society to get to write and then rewrite rules on all the rest of us have to live all the time\nI've said it before it's really important Trump got a lot of support in the early days because he just said political correctness is garbage he just said it's garbage she didn't say oh you know we shouldn't be so politically correct but I understand why people are coming from it no no no it's garbage and it is\nSo destructive to society so destructive to uh our ability to talk to each other as normal people stop normal conversation\nI get frustrated I city or I Do the show there's so many times where I think that's a joke that I could make it'll it'll run through my mind as I can make that joke and Ninety nine percent of\nThe people listening a view the wonderful people listen to the show who do really means so much to me every day Ninety nine percent of you will be like oh that's really funny or maybe maybe even you know Ninety percent of you would think it was funny nine percent of you would think man it wasn't that great and\nThen one percent though of the lives listening or one percent of the people that includes media matters and some of the other maniacs that listen to this show or they would have a problem with it and they would take it and try to twist it and use it as a weapon against me and it's just not worth the risk\nAnd it's really hard to do any kind of comedy is really hard to\n... because comedy entails risks right you're you're you're trying to push boundaries you're trying to I'm I'm not a comedian but I Do some funny stuff here and there and I certainly wish I could do even more amusing uh takes on commentary on politics than I Do but it's I just know that you know you you run up against this\nAh this third rail that's a mobile third rail I that day it's not like it stays in one place you don't know how close you are getting to it because they'll change the rules and they'll change what's going on around you based upon their ability to get ya when they want when they want to get you\nIt's just it's so inspiring going back to the\nThe way that they're using these calls of racism and massaging these allegations as really a primary a primary means to get people to go out and vote for Democrats that's the best they can to\nYou know I I they're they're talking about health care a little bit and basically Trump is a racist and Trump is massage nest and all these other things you know they they also seem to forget that we haven't forgotten\nThat Bill Clinton\nHey ladies I haven't seen a little while as wants you to come over who wants to take a selfie with me\nJust watch words out of hand goes you know I just don't know it's got a mind of its own you know Bill Clinton's out there as somebody who is still very respecting Democrat circles in fact Hillary went out and said recently there was no power imbalance with the president of United States she sent us an interview\nWhat was in a week ago\nThere was no no no power imbalance between the ... the United states and ... injured in the White House that he was having a\nRelations relations with um she still she still say stuff like that and of course she thinks she's still running for president which is [noise] it should give us all a nightmare is how long but it really should be the stuff of bad dreams but I think it it could become our reality before before too long\nThis is the thing that ... there's a there's a joy listening is at the heart of of the Democrat\nPolitical ideology these days it's all about\nUh making sure that no one you know that there used to be this old I forget who it is or who said it I Want to say it's men can but it might not be Jamaican but you know a\nA puritan is somebody who lives with a constant fear that someone somewhere might be having a good time and you find that increasing the tree of Democrats you know a a Democrat is somebody who's constantly and fear of someone\nSomewhere saying anything interesting radical new different you know breaking down old paradigms\nAnd enjoying themselves while they do it you know enjoying themselves why they try to challenge the dominant political orthodoxy Democrats get terrified by that they show\nDesire conformity and discussions all the time in fact they desire telling you what words you can use in the discussion and and who can eat and who can use what kinds of words\nSo many constraints put on this all always I mean I just\nIt would be easy for me to switch you know in in my head if I Want to do in and become a Democrat just call everybody every conserve everyone the other side is racist all the time everything is sexism everything is intersection analogy it's just exhausting though isn't it to think that way\nYou you think about what it really must be like to be some of these\nUh just joyous radical feminist that I've seen recently and had to talk to a few times\nIn the last few months because the whole cabinet situation who really do think of women as this terribly oppressed and marginalized minority in society you know they're actually in mind the majority by population\nThat they really think of themselves this way and there was a constant chip on the shoulder attitude for all their interactions\nWith men always it's just not a good way to go through life it's just not a a\nHealthy way to beat and increasingly I think for Democrats you know it's a it's like a sugar\nHigh politically you know oh you got to do all the virtue signaling and he's got to feel like you're so brave and tall on issues where you're taking what is the most convenient issue for you politically socially and professionally\nAs a Democrat um but at the end days isn't it just\nDoesn't feel kind of a hollow never have to really engage the other side and just call them racist and massage this\nI don't know I Hope people think about this as they go in and they vote or they think about whether they're going to vote or not [noise] definitely worth spending some time [noise] I've got some of my hand right now\nLife all coffee it's like having a warm cup of freedom and keeps you energize and ready to fight the fights that matters\nBlack rival coffee is delicious I

particularly in the big cities\nYeah you've got a lot above all right I thought that was that was brilliant she's like the fact that we are even here in Texas talking about a very ... a very hot Senate race is very telling\nThat's another way of saying yeah like isn't it crazy that like here we are having to be covering this thing that we've made the decision to cover so that tells you that like it clearly has to be covered\nRight exactly\nThey are manufacturing this whole story it it's not I'm not saying there's nothing there but it's not nearly as interesting or as close to ... or anything else that protest seven seven point deficit in the Senate race oh it's only trying to protect Bruce\nI've been saying that she's gonna when my ten points it's not even close it's going to crush this guy I mean the Senate races not some district you should think that they'd have a better sense of what's gonna happen state why but they have no idea none whatsoever or I shouldn't say they have no idea that's not true see\nThey want to tell people what they want to tell them\nAnd they've been pushing this this storyline all ... all along a\nCinderella story to send you a story about an hour\nOr so they've been pushing this and now they're realizing that it's not actually going to be anything like what they had pretends that wasn't the same thing as I say with Jon Ossoff and with Wendy Davis and these other media darling candidate to get all this member media coverage is money folks that's just one thing that you that we never really get to talk about\nBut when we discussed the mainstream media advantage and you get all these people who go on media go on to be the outlets and say oh we take the money out of politics when CNN decides that they're going to do flood zone coverage of some uh some favorites\nCandidate of theirs who has no shot at winning it's essentially an in kind donations to that kid you know when when they decide to really focus in and pushing narrative on somebody it look ... what I'm most candidates spend their money on\nCandidate around rather what'd you cannot spend most of their money on also most of them do this or they spend most of their money on TV buys that's\nWhere the money goes that's right getting their message out on TV well they have to pay for that and the campaigns also at the same you know sponsored by are being paid for by the ... campaign\n... if if you have news networks that will just give you that coverage give you that ability to reach audience for free and do it in a very favorable way with soft you know cream puff interviews and town halls where the other candidates not there at all this stuff\nIs just an in kind of the human CNN MSNBC and others are giving in kind donations to democratic candidates that they pick all the time\nAll the time it was a book about Fox Fox supports conserve kind of Fox's one network won the left\nHas ABC NBC CBS MSNBC PBS CNN\nThose are the ones that come to mind right away you know BBC BBC America outages euro that's right you know I'll just you're always like the Democrats holding such it really is such a such a debacle such an embarrassment speaking of debacle though\nChristian Jeanette ... she has learned we've not mentioned things about her including that you know she's like yeah maybe maybe a\nFighting for the Taliban back in the day if you're an

C. and work I can have a house for ... by an African they've had a price\nNot proud of the party's well you know I've got news ... I don't think that parties are proud of you [laughter] think I don't think a Democrat Party\nIs going to be all that excited\nAbout your candidate see when you get when you get pretty thoroughly walloped by ... which is about to happen as well never these these were the races that were they were telling us we're going to be close going to be really important to see what ends up happening with these races now these are bellwether as for whether Trump is going to have a pretty clear\nPath way to re election in twenty twenty and nope not the case what we see is they were pushing this all along for their own purposes and then they decided that\nIn the last minute they're going to start putting out these polls like yeah OK maybe it wasn't as close as we add everything else you don't\nSay ... what a shock on a shock um it it's just it's so typical\nAnd that's why I really like holding their feet the fire over this one because they're just dig in an even more and we have all this empirical evidence how all this data to show about how they call raises clothes that are about what the races I haven't\nEven the elections haven't even happened yet but I Know you know so that was going to lose a you know ...\nGoing to lose you get these candidates the media is all excited about ... like oh it's going to be amazing and not amazing and I never was going to be amazing it's just\nAll mythology constructed by the Democrat dominated media apparatus\nOh oh I see it coming you see it coming and will continue to be right and the uh the major I tried everything\nThe lame stream media 'cause I think that's a little too corny but the mainstream media is going to continue doing what they're doing as well which is to lie and be wrong a lot too so [noise]\n\nDo you have something you want to say but feel you just can't express it especially on today social media perhaps it's because you don't have a safe place where your opinions matter and where they can truly be hurt that's why I'm happy to tell you about a new alternative media site Snoopy dot com\nSnoopy is an unbiased platform that's all about conversation and community Snoopy not only encourages freedom of expression it guarantees its users the ability to discuss topics freely to express thoughts frustrations and ideas without any suppression front administrators\nShooter its founders vision it's a place where discussion is value and where we can all feel free to say exactly what's on our mind especially the things that make us frustrated and downright Snoopy maybe dot coms free to join an open to all why not jumping let your opinions be heard no shadow betting no character limit no suppression of conservative thought ever\nThe mainstream media and is left wing biased that is inherent and and just constant in so much of the reporting we see\nAnd they just can't handle it I think it's funny though because they want to hold themselves up\nFor being brave like they're the last line of defense against the insanity that his Trump and then when I say to them what is Trump done to you that is so damaging what what is it that Trump has done that makes you think that you should be afraid like oh no what am I going to do\nThey don't have any say no one's no one's losing their job because they've spoken out against Trump in fact people get book deals for speaking out against strong\nIn fact the entire media apparatus is designed to make it more appealing to be anti than pro Trump meanwhile the people who are anti\nTrump think that what they're doing is so hard why 'cause they go to rallies and people are mean to them people are mean conservatives all the time people I mean the conservatives in the grocery store for just saying what they think never mind being an actual conservative media figure I'll tell you a quick\nA funny story I was at the Baltimore train station yesterday and a a young man walked past me and I thought oh okay and you know he kind of did that stop and look you know stop and weird stare thing for us not weird stare but you don't even stop and intense there\nAnd and he goes he goes hey I was just watching you on a hill TV and this was this was one of the first time she's ever happening so I usually think people see me they'll say oh I'm I'm hoping somebody from team buckets and it's like I'm\nStumbling upon what am I long lost family members ah 'cause if you're somebody listens to this radio show we tend to be very tight but no it wasn't somebody who was a radio listener and he says oh you know it's ...
