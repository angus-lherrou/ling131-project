widest person in history she's white\nThe Germany in the Nineteen thirties would have been like a\nYear China to white for us\nIt's a wide and Trump if she's going to get through the election if she does get the nomination which I think some likely now Trump would rush her absolutely crush her\nAnd thinking about how lousy you have that Hillary Clinton clip cruise thinking about how lousy\nElizabeth Warren is actually makes me miss Hillary Clinton I don't know if we had to quit but she was on was she was on the news\nDefending Bill Clinton and his and his uh indiscretions if you will this is a family show and it really made me miss the Clintons loose listen to listen to Hillary Clinton\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now well there are people who look at the incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations had been made and what shape dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation\n[noise] let me tell you why I'm going to miss the Clintons you know what makes a great movie or a great book\nAnything you'd go consume for entertainment you know what makes that\nGuy\nIs the bad guy that makes the movie it's the bad guy that makes the book\nDo you know while you still watch die hard every year at Christmas Time when it comes on TBS yes Bruce Willis was great\nThe bad guy was the best\nYou know while you watch gladiator yeah it's nice in Russell Crowe cut people's heads off not necessarily a family film but you watch it 'cause you hated the bad guy to this day people see walking Phoenix the guy who played the bad guy and they get mad at a\nGame of Thrones law do you watch game of Thrones the best bad guys the best the bad guy makes it and there is never been a bad guy in politics like the Clintons this\nComedy as sleazy is openly corrupt dirt ball couple in the history of politics in American politics\nThey were the best they call Bill Clinton slick willy or their ... witnesses disappear open using the IRS openly intimidate their political enemies Hillary\nClinton as the secretary of state took classified documents and put them on a home server in a bathroom [laughter] that's a that's a violation of the Logan Act it's a felony there's nobody better even than Hillary Clinton with all the like the ability of athlete's\nFoot ... condemn Bill Clinton for what he did in the nineties still the past\nAnd seeing more and go down actually makes me a little bit sad 'cause I thought she had potential to be that but she just didn't happen with the Clinton said but lives with Warner's everything\nEverything you don't want in a politician she's on likeable but if you had to build a sixty nine year old feminist with the beach boys hair cut and that whiny voice that makes you want to put a bullet in your mouth you build Elizabeth Warren\nYou would just just an awful human being you know what let's here's some George Carlin system George Carlin\nSee I'm not one of these people who's worried about everything you've got people like us around you conscious fun of them now\nDay worry about everything about air worried about the water worried about the sorrow where's that insecticides pesticide food additives carcinogens worried about radon gas worried about as fast as worried about saving\nEndangered species let me tell you about endangered species I [noise] saving endangered species is just one more hour into camps by humans to control nature it's arrogant meddling it's what got us in trouble in the first place doesn't anybody understand that interfering with nature\nOver Ninety percent over way over Ninety percent of all of a species that have ever\nLived on this planet ever lived like I\nSaid we didn't\nKill them all [noise] they just disappeared [noise] that's what nature does it gives us\nHere these days at the rate of twenty five a day and I mean regardless of our our behavior irrespective of how we act on this planet twenty five species that we're here today\nWill be gone tomorrow let them go gracefully [noise] leave me alone haven't we done enough\nWas so self important so self important that what is going to save something now\nSay the tree saves if he said no way shape those nails\n[noise] and the greatest arrogance hall save the planet where people kidding me\n[laughter] All right I I promised you this war including ... these weren't quips this was now we know non Native American Elizabeth Warren on her rise to political power Warren traffic\nOf her grandfather on her mental as part of the family lore my aunt be has walked by that picture at least a thousand times remarked\nThat he had that her father my path all had high cheekbones like all of the Indians do but that's how she saw it and she said and your mother got those same rate she sounds and I think she thought this was the bad the hill she had gotten in light\n\nOf wrong about what it is I have to wait wait what started their\nMom and dad oh we're very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and\nFather's parents and absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee she's ... and um [noise] after fighting as long as they kind of my parents went off they loved it was an issue in our\nOld was he was born in ... as high cheekbones\nAnd now now it's all gone\nOne DNA tests that she did it's all gone now she has no presidential future and she has droopy cheekbones that sucks she really didn't come out of that with that either but hey I mean you always have the memories of pop all\nYou want to write main complaint or compliment me write me it just said I Am Jesse Kelly dot com I'm going to have a special\nWell I should say more security is going to have a special one saves coming up this week only for Jesse Kelly listeners November second there's a Special K PR sea event that I'm going to invite five of you to\nGet to that tomorrow\nI was obviously a great today I did not get a chance to rip on Chris today as much as I normally like in for that oh you all sincere apology [noise] good night good no that's all\n[noise]\nDoing the work in the house dumped\nMile ... thirty team members standing together and saying more Houston brown worse he uses strong\nMedia that's for a feverishly as fervently trying to cover for Elizabeth Warren some reason to the words are coming out I could be one way or the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with that keeps happening today\nBut she released the information from her her test today right or she has decided to let the world know that her long scrutinized and many would say the bong Native American\nHeritage is now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe\nWhere the quote vast majority of warns family tree is European is it says that she has a date of American ancestry hold in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a\nReally a non scientific\nBackground ed and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth\nNative American and the Boston Globe initially did the math\nWrong on that one uh so I'm I'm here to to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here and this was this was a truly\nJaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because\nThis was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will\nThis wasn't a some surprise that a a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop and make it difficult for her to get elected to the contrary Elizabeth Warren took the position\nThat this would bolster her claim I\nDon't know which is worse here\nOr that Elizabeth Warren is show delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as it as to think that this will stop continue mockery of her for racial fraud\nI mean the hill where I work in response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the real headline here if I may finally be civil is it there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor\nA couple of hundred years ago and since then it has been one long on on on interrupted line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than average\nInner connection to the Native American population meaning you and to me listening as if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have in white an American is likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are here\nWe are she she must have thought that this was going to uh give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago there's no realistic way there's no way to know if even the Ken generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when\nYou look at the Boston Globe analysis\nAnd you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all kinda hazy in nonsense anyway quote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of Warren's DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford\nA really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of warns ancestry is European but the results strongly support the existence of an on an ad mix and Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago um this folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person\nIs that if you listen to the Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American\nFor professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even matter if you call yourself Native American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's\nEvery but we're all Native American by this standard\nIs just completely nuts\nIt's just completely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to to force this incredible uh on\nFor stare on on her part is just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting in the top four or five\nOf early support from the Democrats for running for president and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as big CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place\nUm and and when you look at this\nAnalysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat is amazing to me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter]\nI mean she's she's like one one thousand Native American maybe and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration\nFrom South of the border in the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes and yet people in the media was things seriously prove that Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up now\nWhat what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren has completely clown herself here I mean just made a complete mess of things and so they're the media has to go even further\nAnd they have to somehow\nPretend like yeah that's right you prove that that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it but well what else are they going to do I mean this is a this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nAs a Cherokee and she stole that recipe from a French chef [noise]\nOh my gosh you can't make this stuff up you really can't it it's just it's hard to hard to come up with a way that this whole story\nCan gets crazier it really is it's hard to come up with a way that this could be even even more absurd and more bizarre I'm ... sure enough the lips if they can find a way they will if there's anything that they can point to hear\nThat will distract or you know she says six to ten generations ago\nShe has a Native American ancestor she'd doubled down on this I mean\nShe thinks this is vindication I Know you could say book how does this how does this really matter what one keep in mind that this week\nThere is a very serious a lawsuit that's not even lost his trial I should say that's underway where Harvard University's has to defend itself against claims of racial bias against Asian Americans and if there's any justice Harvard will lose so the do racial entitlement state is very real [noise]\nAnd the left is supportive of it and they have created this system that\nIs going to always fall into self contradiction that just doesn't really make sense [noise]\nYou know what what does it require how do you get to claim a a a status\nThat affirmative action will help for college applications what has to be in your background will get her more than they would [noise]\nPut on three eight six nine Nineteen Seventy six uh this is Jimmy ... with a message from my friends are Dina leasing now you already know the dean at least they can save you up to fifty percent every month it's understood that easily saves you big money\nWhat's funny is if you talk to somebody who actually leases within the first thing they rave about is the experience we have with Dina leasing dean as saving money each and every month but they can't help it talk about how pleasant the whole Dina I'm experiences is easy to see why clients myself included can't stop talking about the leasing process with the folks that [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that\nI was born in eastern Oklahoma\nIndian Territory until just a few years earlier when you hit the kind of\nDaddy always said he fell head over heels and\nMy daddy's parents herrings dinner ... to ... my mother read was part Native American this sort of discrimination was common to time so when my mom always Nineteen my daddy always twenty below\nSo sure enough Warren put out a video today about all this stuff ah Elizabeth Warren decided that the best thing for her to do would be to actually create some kind of a a little propaganda film for herself\nWhere she would have different members of her family and they're different people all involved in this and I feel I feel like there should be some degree of of embarrassment here\nOr there should be some oh my gosh what am I doing but then again when you when you look at what's really happening on ... across the board right now with with the media and with the effort to take down Trump anything is acceptable as long as it is for\nThe cause I mean anything is going to be considered okay here\nAs long as it is a evidence or useful in the anti Trump cause I just I\nI've reached the kind of a new a new level here and a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all this stuff and and what they're willing to do and what they're willing to put the American people through a in terms of\nPropaganda and and the whys and there's no way that a normal person could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here and she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing about her that justifies this notion of being Native American\nAnd yet\nYou know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect example I see nothing in their main headlines all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your mark show you later but nothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven\nEight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote Warren's DNA never mattered Trump I how how is this Trump's fault in one world is that is the takeaway here that Trump isn't a\nYou know accepting her DNA results or something these people are insane they really are I ... it's just impossible for them to be a ... embarrassed here's another eat another version Huffington Post trunk\nDenies this is their top story about this Trump denies making charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Trump sad and was it was very specific Trump said that if she makes it through the primaries and is the Democrat and now the knee\nAnd then and then she\nProves that she as Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars to repair a charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he said which is he would just give her a million dollars if you prove she's a Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because if she\nNative American everybody's Native American and anyone who's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this and the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth here would automatically\nUnderstand I vicious just pathetic it is\nAbsolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from all these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually covers the right word because they're really covering for Warren\nAnd this is because what they think happened today is uh that would they thing happened today is that\nShe's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty this is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe's a joke she should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares\nThat's their headline that\nThe headline to see this is a perfect case of media bias at work they think that they're progressive great hope for twenty twenty is in jeopardy right now because of her\n\nAntifa are you guys are antifa right I used to be a big thing they used to get a lot of media attention at least conservative media would sometimes talk about them but left doesn't seem to want to talk about them that was some\nAudio that we play for you of the the latest and the incidence out on the uh\nI don't do it as well as Trump Trump's antifa is better than my antifa are but I don't do it as well she does\nOut on the west coast in Portland\nWhich strikes me as a strange place for that it'd be quite so much\nPolitical extremism but but that's I suppose it is what it is right that is going on there um but and you got these people with with his edgy for group that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I I forget exactly even what the\nWhat the group was called um let me do a quick refresher on that one but you know you sure enough you had\nYou had this uh this violent\nIncident where your protesters and counter protesters your ego bears spray\nAnd bloody brawls at patriot yeah patriot prayer law and order march\nIn Portland you have to be very careful my friends when you see the way that these kinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention because there's\nA lot of a political hedging that goes on there is a lot of usage of kind of weasel words and\nWhat they believe in what they take out of these descriptions for example just because the ACLU and\nBy the way I Know nothing about this patriot prayer group I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and had a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I have no idea there are too many of these are little you know local political groups for me to know every single one of them\nBut I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not\nA reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry ... Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in the Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a a a political extremist or a right wing extremist white nationalist any any of those\nThanks you cannot trust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive fundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases in any group that has\nTo pay a multimillion dollar settlement too much it was a for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want to take with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations and and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that that's one part of it but then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that it is a normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black\nAnd they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons\nThey're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle\nThey want to fight people and the fact that they showed up with they're spraying these other things tells you all that you need to know uh but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not covers this makes for really compelling footage\nThis is a story that you'd think they'd want to tell you how are almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot\nPrayer group they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order\nA I've got a I've got to wonder is is that just say is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust\n'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened\nFor example ... just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of project is just like showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems well maybe it's because they showed up and the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nHe's got an a gay man they gauge it you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and Trump being a Nazi and they want to they want to hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do this little home videos or this because these are radical their political radicals\nAnd you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates I'm from a domestic terrorist organization is that to date antifa has put a limit on the degree of their violence right they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something\nLethal action against it but they have engaged in violent action and keep in mind that that violent action\nIf you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly\nAnd all of a sudden a group that has issued lethality in the past when it comes with violence may maybe in a position where they feel like that is open to them and in fact that's\nThe path way that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the anarchists to remind me a lot of antifa\nOr the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean the the sort of what I mean real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they were the ones who are assassinating presidents tried to blow up a stock exchange that's right it was anarchists not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there was another incident on\nA friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight a there was this ... this group that the Proud Boys\nAnd I've never really understood\n... who they are or what what they are I I've heard that they have they have some I should actually probably just call Gavin McGinnis and ask\nHim the metropolitan Republican club invited the Proud Boys\nAre which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this in this one piece from reading and there were two or three counter protesters that were beat up now\nI don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who are just there to have a discussion I I think if you show up ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do and\nYou show up at one of their events are are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation or you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that they're going to scare the proud\nBoys I mean this is this is ... that's the question what are they really doing that [noise]\nWith all the recent news about online security reduces hard not to worry

really well thought of by the media\nTends to be\nPeople who won cultivated a certain persona with the media and to also are a little more shall we say willing to take a\nPoint of view that would be well received\nBy academia and the media on a whole bunch of things I've noticed is before generals starting to get very political and journals like we love is this tremendous I have no idea I'm just saying that I'm aware of this as a phenomenon a vet for example\nA lot of the stuff that came out of a general portrayed as\nI was not surprised by it all 'cause I had known for a long time that he was a a a guy who was seeking out the media and very much trying for his own purposes to to\nCreate this narrative of portray us as the the greatest military might have a generation I Would I Would just point out that before\nEven are being brought low by the extramarital affair\nAnd the woman and a classified information that he didn't do it you know all the stuff that you already know about and he had to\nPlead guilty and pleaded guilty or you know he he was credited with fixing Iraq which yes the surge work but it was really are\nA hundred and fifty thousand troops and people that were on the front lines that fixed Iraq but his strategy was successful there but there were some very important ingredients that were in place for that strategy to work\nI Would note that strategy that he tried in Afghanistan did not work was not working and was never going to work\nAnd he was not really willing to hear about how that was the case so while I I think on the one hand you know he gets all of this credit for Iraq well if he gets all this credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation Afghanistan I understand that he's not that portrays was not this uh men beyond ...\nWhen I came to his ... certainly not beyond approach period but also when it came to the strategy so that's that's a matter of saying I Need to do a little more I Need a little more analysis of what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long\nAnd maybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to call him a Democrat I also this kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat as kind of a a little sly uh yeah\n... ... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat you know it's like when I say in my in my media life my guys okay it's kind of a communist\nSo Trump says it's kind of a Democrat he also says you know that\nTrump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to we need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this\nStuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have the right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love the White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back and I say hold on a minute\nGiven what we know about all the different leagues\nAnd all the people that are in the White House including Republicans who are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump but all we know that there's somebody right now who wrote if you if you believe in New York Times and\nI don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now\nWho wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president and to go to these\nIf you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out of this guy was the anonymous\nEditorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody as White House of course it would be silly to do that and that's also why I I give him more leeway than I Would in other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if you're a Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become turn coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some pretty decent recognition within party circles I mean you talk about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat\nIn that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nFor the president's a trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record\nAnd I'm like you're not telling me that he was really some of them you know telling you what I mean it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade of you know I'm really giving you some access and insight here and I'm trying to build this report and then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record\nIt would make them look even better you know they're like off the record a volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building\nIs that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so\nI guess so ah\nAnd then you know the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with Leslie stall in this interview or had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left\nAnd the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position a since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that they stole the same thing they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault\nAnd Trump's as well do it's the law and I don't think that they\nEven I don't think he's media critics even really understand that to say that it's\nThe law is to say that it's actually the Congress that does bear some of it's not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either inept or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is to find a way to adjust the law\nThat it's a bad law or to repeal it entirely\nIsn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration\nFor him when he felt frustrated with Congress ... articles er Cox and what what was right\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcing it's not just about enforcement when you don't enforce something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted by Congress\nAnd I think that's part of this that just immediately that the press puts aside for pushes aside and they really assume what I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be\nOr they would be just crushed because of what had been going on at the border and I think that they miscalculated that for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told\nThat you know immigrants or do jobs or whatever the legal ... folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy\nAnd they would like to have some reestablish mental the rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has and build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house\nBut all this on this issue of the border you can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children\nA little bit better ... isn't that nice isn't it fun just to die of below the one and only is with us now she's the author of a new book just out hashtags do not disturb how she goes to her cell phone and took back her life gender diet great to have you as always\nThanks so much for having me back always great\nTo be here isn't it ... back to the early days at the blaze you were just like we're both do it early Fox heads and now ... you know all\nOf the view as well as Fox News as well as author what what brought you to write this book\nThis was my passion project oftentimes in this industry when people decide to write a book because editor it's come to them and say hey this would be a really great topic for you to write about you know because of what you're talking about on TV and what not\nThis was something I actually when I realized I had an addiction to technology I went from being one of those people who loved conversation face to face time you know going into the countryside and hanging out on floods\nInteracting with people face to face focused engaged to someone who was constantly distracted by cell phone I pat\nSocial media to a point where I wasn't sleeping while anymore it was getting up in the middle of the night on my bathroom breaks to check Twitter the check social media to have that ... with an ex boyfriend to save my last piece through an email to to a colleague at work and I I was my body was suffering my mind was suffering and I decided you know what\nI Want to change that and want to figure out why this is happening why are we so addicted and be I Want to take some steps to make that easier and I want to show people this does not have to be something that gets fixed through\nGovernment regulation or government involvement or oh we're going to step in and we're going to make a whole bunch of rules and laws this is something that needs to get fixed through people making a decision to change the way they use the technology that lived to be self empowered to um\nYou know make these changes that I felt that it kind of like a personal responsibility manifesto for twenty eight feet [noise]\nWow well what what happened when you started actually taken back responsibility away from the machines\n[noise] so what I did was I started small you know everybody said\nOh you know how you're going to do that I started small and I turned off the notifications on my phone which was amazing you have to ... you can still go into those states it you can decide hey I Want to be active on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook but if you don't have that constant stream of notifications beckoning you to those sites\nYou have a lot more peace of mind you feel much more in control of those cases I took the phone out of the bedroom and I said you know what when I go with my bedroom I usually go in about an hour before that I hang out and now I watch either you know old\nFriends episodes or I I read a book or I just kinda chill out that was a time I didn't want to be staring at the phone and what research shows actually that's really interesting is that even if you're not on the phone if the phone is by you even if it off and there's no notification coming through nothing you are\nPerturbed you are distracted because you are compelled to want to touch that phone to want to look at that divide so I just removed it from my face I also did something really simple when I was with friends I said you know what\nI'm gonna try something for these three hours I'm just going to put the phone in my bag and I'm not going to worry about it I'm going to take an actual break I'm not going to run on my bathroom break you know while we're waiting for dinner to calm and check every possible feature on the phone I'm just going to get my mind a chance to arrest and when I started\nTo see the impact is that I really said wow there's something she was\nBorn it's absolutely delicious imitation made in the greatest city on earth it's called giant Texas bourbon it is delicious smooth and everything else you want from a bourbon\nThey use grains grown right here in the state of Texas so this really is a Texas bourbon by the way it's also family owned and operated right next to downtown Houston you could go check out the distillery yourself you're going to love giant Texas bourbon now it's not available everywhere yet but it should be and you can help us out with that by\nAsking for giant Texas bourbon and restaurants and bars and liquor stores in your area it's made by the same people responsible for BJ hookers vodka so you know it tastes great and you know it's at a great price which is your perfect every day bourbon for football\nTailgate parties inviting guests over people are gonna think giant Texas bourbon is delicious when you give them a taste and it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg to pick some up today giant Texas bourbon it's just that simple\nI\nMean we would hear I already you invite you to see bleak would Mac and live such a huge amount of material to imagine how would it be the ... I'm being part of\nA show would you be motivated would you be going forward would you be somebody that would you be moving through [noise]\n\nBack when you know because when it comes to the boys were never saw\nThere's something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're going after she was going to get to the bottom of it and they will be severe punishment\nWhat happens you journalist ... ... the\nEntire world seems absolutely sat on trying to get an answer to that question what what what happened to this man how how was it that he was able to uh disappear from the Turkish consulates are in in in ...\nFor me it constantly Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd now we have this very real looming international relations crisis on our hands ... how did we how did we get to this point how do we find ourselves in a situation where we have to deal with this you know the the president has raised the possibility of rogue killers\nBecause the president's I'm sure he said that he spoke to a king Solomon behind the scenes keep in mind the king of Saudi Arabia is a pretty\nUh what's the word in from old men at this point it's really a NBS Mohammed bin Solomon who is the thirty three year old crown prince he's the guy who runs stuff\nAnd he's the one who has done this whole charm offensive in this country in big business and big media and big government all being buddy buddy with and the ...\nSo that's why this is such a shockwave through the elite communities the the Davos set is little oh my gosh what we do know we can we can have the Saudis funding trips for us anymore\nUh and and there's there's the reality of what this tells us of Saudi Arabia which is interesting and I'll get to that I'm ... and there's also the pending probably will be the case at some point when you watch the ... when you listen I'll watch when you listen to this show I Will have confirmation on that but as of right now it sounds like\nThey are planning to say that this was a rogue elements within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nOn the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus I've also seen early reports that it may be a maybe the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went over the line\nUm but the Saudis can hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that's that's the latest on it so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep the assembling on is that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a jam here um as I should be the Saudi regime is\nA terrible and ah and disgusting government but we're not really often told that because they have a tremendous amount of sway even our own media they own a lot of shares a lot of very important media companies but here's what you see\nThe pivot the payment that's going to happen it's already started to happen because you have this issue of a repressive fatalities Harry in Muslim\nHow often do you hear about that a Muslim majority nation not just the Muslim majority nation entirely Muslim nation the most Muslim country by percentage I Believe in the world maybe Somalia I mean there are a couple of other countries that are right up there but the Saudis do not allow non Muslims\nJew beep you know citizens of the peninsula I mean the Saudis are did they do not allow Christian worship or ceremonies are houses of worship to be or even be built on on Saturday land so this is a a hyper Islamist\nGovernment which you don't ever hear hyper Islamist regime um and I talk a little bit about that huh holy book unholy alliance between the ... hobbies or the Salafis fundamentalist\nIslam and is Bedouin tribe a house of Saud that as the Saudi regime Saudi royal family so you know there's all this complexity on the issue but but here's what what's happening right now\nThis is going to quickly become a crisis that ... that is much more about what Trump does for our media than what it really means\nI'm already hearing you know because Trump ... up with dictators that's why this happens this is the line you hear this all the time Trump is so is coddled dictators here here's what I Want to say to anybody in response to that because you hear this all over the place the media next few days\nI don't think it's possible to call dictators more than Obama did I I think it would be very hard you'd have to work really hard to do so because Obama made some very clear errors in dealing with authoritarians in strongly for one is his word didn't mean anything\nWhen it came to consequences the erasing of the red line in Syria led to a free for\nGet full details on the example policy of political dot com slash commercial surprise can vary depending on your health insurance company never found out to be able to\n[noise]\nRole if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct we know now we're all in retrospect do you think [noise]\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you that where the investigation if the current incumbent against him numerous allegations had been made and which have dismisses denies and ridicules [laughter]\nThat's what she had nothing to do with anything you\nSee it was only her husband who was a serial abuser of women\nWho was credibly accused of sexual assaults by women on the record with full facts and the stories ready to go\nMedia didn't want to cover that you see this is where I I I just I I take a moment because I Want to step back and make sure we all around the same page when it comes to the narrative of the moment here\nShe the narrative of the moments in the left is that oh what Bill Clinton did then\nShe would never be able to do now you see it's different because of this me too movement it's different now Bill Clinton's ah what will be called a ... what what is left like to call them his his personal failings very calm way of saying Bill Clinton being a predator\n... myself when I was just you know\nI met on Okonjo showed a curse word the oval office but all that much much worst up in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nDisgrace\nA it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively aggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people like Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was part of the Clinton machinery for example\nAnd he is treated with with ... he's a hundred million dollar men now ABC\nNews anchor that has to me for who decides to pay that much money it's it's an innocent astonishing thing it really is oh without Stephanopoulos who would watch these shows everybody would watch these shows these are platforms wherever they put in these roles is going to get a certain amount of viewership\nBut he seems to get a excused from being a part of a country machinery and Hillary who just had her clearance taken away I Want it back I mean Hillary just\nWas finally told you don't get to have a security clearance anymore for cereal and flagrant violations of national security protocol for anybody who has a clearance she was just told that now she still hasn't\nRaised show has been achieved even a modicum of honesty you could say to bar from Obama not a smidgen smoking um honesty she doesn't have a smidgen of honesty she's such a liar\nAnd she knows that she well she still thinks that she has a a political future and it would be a problem for her the left has gone show all in on this whole me too movement\nThey've made this such a a prominent part of what the left and for now it's the ... movement of the moment\nRight we've had black lives matter or we've had Occupy Wall street we've had these different a political ... revolutionary\nLeftist movements in this country and right now it's the me too movement it will change they will move to some other intellectual fat or fashion in some time just just wait for it but in the meantime they have to make sure that they don't have the weaponization of some of these things occurring\nBack on them they don't want to score and their own goals here with me too movement and that DNA blurs\nI've always felt that the enablers in this whole process we're getting off far too easy you know the people men and women around someone like a Harvey Weinstein people men and women around someone like a Les Moonves you know those who were\nNecessary in this whole\nProcess of ... they don't get in trouble they don't really get called out and Hillary was the ultimate in that not only did she stand by her man of course as we know for the most\nObvious and self interested political reasons imaginable\nBushy went on the attack against these women and whenever I hear people say things like don't they have a right to be believed I was wondering respond well\nTo the women that Hillary demeaned I mean did did the women that were completely attack verbally and the media down to their very character they were all considered to be fighters\nThe cause at the time and there has been no accountability for that whatsoever and there's no accountability to stay for Hillary when when she held accountable for the fact that she was\nEssential in her husband's not just denials but continued book flagrant violations of\nThe public trust and an overhaul Bill Clinton was accused of rape folks\nRape not just your ... and I really don't like and this happens you know this usage of the term sexual assault and sexual harassment being conflated with sexual solved and all of a sudden people are like well you know both sides have their problems you've got Clarence Thomas on one side Bill Clinton on the other no\nClarence Thomas was accused and I don't think particularly credibly accused of sexual inappropriate stuff in the office I mean the worst case basis Clarence Thomas should have been pulled aside by age aren't told hey you know knock that offered this going to be professional consequences that if he did it I Would think you did it\nBut what could have spent decades in prison for what you did the allegations against Bill Clinton were up of rape by force and that that's going to send you to prison for very long time of your your life is essentially over and\nHe went on to be the president of seats for eight years so yes you mean the Hillary coming out now and saying that she wasn't a part of any of this she lies now with such fluidity and so shameless like I Would tell you all if you if you want to have a a quick and fun read go back and read\nChristopher Hitchens no one left alive [noise] Hitchens was one of these he was a leftist in the nineties and was still a really is a socialist kind of a reform socialist all the way to the very end and clearly an atheist [noise] but he was somebody who just couldn't stomach allies with the Clintons and the big lives I mean the very obvious\nIn your face self interested lying up the Clintons and he wrote a book called no one left ally do and he just goes through how would you lie about stuff [noise]\nMaybe\nDot com friends remember that name this is a new social media sites where you can\nPost you can write you can follow me you can follow me ...\nWants to hear that and so they are giving their audience what they want which is that's maybe the biggest part of it all over the top you can argue this either way and the other is that they really believe that this president is so racist and it's such a bad guy is so disreputable and so disgraceful\nThat they find it completely within the realm of of not just possibility but they find it likely\nThat the president noted states would just go off and start praising a Confederate leader as he as they're saying he did in this ah Ohio rally over the weekend\nOr and then it took them two days I mean this was not a trick them two days October twelve the correction posted in October fourteen here's the NBC News correction and earlier tweet missed identified the general President Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio\nIt was general Ulysses Grant not Robert elite and attach to video clip lacked the full context for Trump's remark\nHere's the full clip now this is where you have to start playing the game probability\nIs it likely\nThat all of these major media corrections could be due to good faith error in covering the president or is it more likely that what we see happening here is a trumped arrangement syndrome as it plays out in the media in front of all of us all the time\nWhich of those things is the more likely scenario I mean I I think you really do have to ask the question and the answer is obvious the press is dare I say on a jihad\nAgainst the president United States they will\nTake any opportunity to try to tear him down and try to add one more data point into the narrative that he is racist that he's evil that he's a bad guy and\nThis is also compounded by the incentive structure that we have in in the media in general right now where the initial lie get twenty thousand retreats or you know a hundred thousand ... and then the correction gets two hundred\nAnd so you get the benefit of of all that traffic of all that attention because now in the digital Arab media you really are measuring it down very precisely you know how many people read this how many people are going to your site and if people saw this you get all the upside and your audience gets what they want\nAnd then if you have to correct it OK well turns out you know that was amiss fire but your audience is never mad at you for bashing\nFrom when the correction I mean this audience would be but if you're NBC if you're MSNBC or CNN if you're any of those networks audience doesn't turn on you for that they understand what you're trying to do they know that you have bigger things in mind they know that you have a you know\nOther things that you're trying to do trying to take down the price of the United states that's going to be a difficult thing difficult thing to do and you're going to you're going to have some Mrs if you're doing that right so\nThat's that's just it just in more the media malpractice that we keep seeing and that's why when the president calls them fake news when he says things like you\nKnow they they are fake news and they get so upset if they want him to stop calling them fake news maybe they should stop being fake news you know if they would like the president on stage to no longer\nA push back on them for the obvious partisan smears in their partners in campaigns well then my recommendation to them would be that ah you know we shouldn't is that they shouldn't act in this way\n... you know do you think any of them will will apologize when Beto O'Rourke loses by ten or eleven points which is going to or do you think any of the pollsters in any of the meeting people that are a month ago or something it's going to be a really close race with Pedro and Ted Cruz they're going to come out and say may call but I don't think so\nBecause their their activists once you understand that there are activists then you realize that there's none of this is even a little bit surprising anymore none of this this is a shock\nAnd and then you know then you could at least anticipate their next move ... I mean the Leslie stall interview uh was was great because first of all I I find her whole\nHer whole demeanor she's just so serious and so much ... toss missed precedent I'm doing this very professional interviewer\nI mean in a certain point you think yourself can you ask a question like a normal person do\nYou have to do this very affected sixty minutes I'm so in depth here\nOh I'm just going show in depth on the issue I mean I loved it when he said Leslie it's okay in the meantime on the president and you're not they're not used to this\nMost presidents certainly all Republican presidents stretching back for my whole lifetime\nUh we're in a position where they felt they had to suck up the meat you maybe you only exception was Reagan but the rest of them felt like they had to suck up to the media or else they're presidency would really suffer because the media had so much power and so much ability to sway public opinion instead Trump is like you know what do you think you're going to push me around is going to push back\nAnd he did he did a fantastic job in that Lesley Stahl interview but they still can't leg loving 'em in the\nMedia is coming up with everything they've got the lie about him they do publish fake news they say fake news they do all kinds of things\nYeah and the day the president's just got it's got too many skills they can't handle\nIf you've ever found yourself when sing at that week taste of coffee from one of those ... corporate brands you probably thought\nI Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased training bathroom policy reform and thing to defy common sense and more time on their coffee that's why you need to start every day with black rifle coffee\nI find black rifle absolutely delicious and not only is a fantastic

agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nIn a simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had of been real this thief would've taken out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments are eviction notices showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies today\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title the instant they detect sinister activity their own at helping to shut it down your title may already be compromise you know sign up and get a free title scared and report\nI'm creatures they would all be viewed as going to the mat for righteous cause they would all be viewed as having done the right thing\nEven if they hadn't come out of course in the end and now we see is well yeah sure the left is excited about this but the left wing base already hated Kavanaugh they already hated Trump they already were going to do anything that they could to vote for Democrats\nWhat they didn't anticipate was a normal Americans yes dare I say even some undecided independents saw the way the Democrats were acting and that whole process and they came away from it thinking I don't think we should hand over power to crazy I don't think we should hand over power the crazy I don't think that makes sense it's a bad idea\nIf you're not going to hand over power to crazy that means you got to keep the\nThe Republicans in church or that means that all of the media is efforts to create this Russia collusion narrative and all these other stories about Trump and the twenty twenty Fifth Amendment and all of that will have been for not\nHave been for naught because instead of just understanding that it was a do or die political issue for the Republicans Republicans do not cave when it came to Kavanaugh\nOr they thought if they were willing to take the gloves off and ... take the gloves off and do anything they would of course come out the victors and yet that was the that was the assumption that uh they were making\nAnd it was a very bad assumption as we see now\nBut I just think it's engineer you at it and MSNBC host thinks you know wow it's like you mean like there people are like upset about the Kavanaugh thing and I think the Democrats but of course what they want to say Democrats weren't effective\nWhich is really a almost a version of well you know communism is just not implemented well enough right it's not the with the Democrats did with Kavanaugh was on its face in its essence at its foundation a complete him completely immoral disgrace it was\nBut that's not what they were taken away from this where they're taking away as oh I guess Democrats didn't play there and play their hand well enough\nI guess maybe they didn't you know strategize this thoroughly enough ... as Bush would've said ... ... are great words that are that Bush gave us a so I I Would note that this is this is a very real sentiment folks to houses in play said it's going to be Republican\nWe're going to go where you and I are going to be high fiving on November sex when the Senate results come in the Senate it's good to go so we're clear which also means that the president is in no danger whatsoever of being removed I mean not that he really was anyway but\nYou know you have a Republican majority never mind getting two thirds you wanna get fifty one and get the president out\nUm but on the house side of things we have been led to believe all along that there was a ...\nAlmost no chance the Republicans would keep the house now we see hold on a second not only is the overstating the case thing true when it comes to ... ...
