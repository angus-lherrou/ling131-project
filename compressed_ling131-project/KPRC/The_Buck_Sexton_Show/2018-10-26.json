news fake bombs in them the media's mad about this\n\nLook we we haven't touched much on this bomb story today because it's starting to look like there's not much there\nThey're not really explosive a guy came out today and said uh FBI is saying\nThey're really all missing components to make something explode and you've seen them they don't look like pipe bombs I'm sure if you've been on mine you've seen them they look they look like some idiot through something together with some Plato and some super glue and mailed him off\n\nAnd we don't want to speculate which means obviously I'm about to speculate\nBut\nIt looks like some kid honestly it looks like some kid so some sixteen\nSeventeen year old computer savvy kids these kids are great online now finding people's addresses I mean they

though he blew up his acting career about two decades ago that's neither here nor there but\nI'll be interested to see what comes of all this uh I Will say not that I'm surprised literal embarrassed by the stereo press coverage\nI almost feels it's best way to put this for two years depresses talked about how Trump talks to them\nAnd how upset they are about how Trump talks to them than Trump's making us the enemy of the people in Trump's saying this and Trump saying that\nAnd every time something like this happens it almost feels like they're happy that does\nTwo days of of headlines fits their goal headlines about Trump's assault on the press this is because of Trump's rhetoric I Can't believe what Trump to you guys kind of seem a little giddy about it in\nRight now there's nothing to it I mean we don't want to don't want to call everything a hoax you know we don't want to downplay the seriousness of somebody possibly sending a bomb\nBut nothing's happened right now what happened

while using a blow torch to kill spiders you know what's under rated overkill that's what's under rated\n\nI Know you love today's show please write me with all of your complements\nBureaucratic nightmare of an investigation going on merely to target their political enemies that's the whole purpose of it\nThey now have mobs in the streets mobs on the Supreme Court steps mobs on Capitol Hill in the in the halls of Congress they pretend that they're not mobs\nAnd then when there was finally the first time that they think they have an opening to whack a finger at the other side over incivility which remember it wouldn't be the instability of a mob it wouldn't be the instability of an entire movement\nIt would just be maybe one wacko who is sending what increasingly looks like yard bombs to very\nVery prominent Democrats and leftists and\nThey want to lecture all of us and they claim that they're not doing it which just goes to show you how much gas\nLighting goes on in our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples of us we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all of this just how delusional they really are\nBut I did want to spend them with you first on what we what we now know about uh about these bombs in fact I could have an assist here from the attorney general my buddy Jeff Sessions' place with a please\n... apartment is responding to the suspicious packages that have been sent\nTo several political leaders and a media outlet and then ask last few days yesterday I spoke with FBI Director Chris Wray and\nAnd deputy director they vow outage and we met with and brief the president to bring him up to date FBI ATF are working on this or profit ministry nation we condemn the actions that led onto a these ... these activities and the strongest possible terms on turns\nInto determined to make sure that we get to the bottom of it injustices done\nThey will find who is responsible for this I'm very confident of that I don't know how quickly though and I don't know if it will be in time for us to make a fully informed decision us being the American people you and I already\nKnow this doesn't if it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about Trump or the Republican Party or anything else that has nothing to do all the safety threat this is one\nVery very stupid and ah\nAnd agree just an evil jerk\nI wanted to use another word but we're on radio or who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison it's just a question of how soon we put him through that process\nBut the judge bombs that have been found so far no could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances\nThere was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia\nBut they talked about how the bombs that haven't gone off and kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the M y pd is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment\nThat the largest police department the country's as no these are these are ... and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar\nPerson opens it up and goes well I Know what to do it and then we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs\nOr the NYPD can't take that risk not yet\nI Can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think\nThat is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to go there but then again I actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it\nAnd in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what ... and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have tended to get buck slapped\nRather hard here's what I see if you were\nTrying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh which\nWas toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh\nDebacle self inflicted wound was toxic and the caravan\nMaking its way up through Mexico the far left active is when the Democratic party loves this story um but the people in places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who were figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electoral prospects they don't like that\nAnd so if you want it to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here now\nIs in fact possible some would even\nSay probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible problem this is one\nIncredibly stupid reckless and a ... and really her doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump so much they thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely\nThat's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that\nIf this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the timing if the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democrats and in the process\nMake the anti Trump media seem sympathetic and\nGive them something to talk about that might be ways to moderate to their side just in time the election would this be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy I'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false black\nAnswers obviously yes so that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I refused to take the position that\nWell because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for this\nWhat you are right the media has spoken that's the way it's going to be they they like the John Brennan version of events play six\nUnfortunately I think Donald Trump too often has helped to incite a some of these feelings of\nAnger and violence um when he points to acts of violence or also talks about [noise] you know a swinging at somebody or from the press the media I'm hoping that this is going to\nMake it clear to him about what he has done before as far as a lot of this rhetoric really is counterproductive it is on American\nIs on American says the guy who was a senior intelligence officer who without any evidence\nHas accused publicly accused the sitting president of the United states of treason which as we know is not just the crime\nThat is a pro scribes view the constitution itself but is punishable under us federal code by the death penalty out so one would think that John Brennan is not exactly the best person to be carrying the torch of civility now\nBut then again\nOne would be mistaken if one thought that the left hand any decency or any honesty to deal with your sleep ranges making a name for himself being the craziest Volpe liquid seven\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list what we've seen to date as someone who whips up the crowd he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his\nUm vitriol and while he might think that he's just putting on the TV all you need is one person\nWho doesn't realize that and one person who thinks it's okay to do this someone tried to murder by Iraq and Michelle Obama bill and Hillary Clinton and this is not a coincidence\nSo now Trump is responsible for any single individual psychopath in the country that takes his words to mean something there not also didn't fully brings forget that just a few weeks ago Donald Trump junior [noise] had a white powder sent us home and his wife open didn't had to go to the hospital\nIs is that just not as important to the left as judge bombs being sent to people I I guess the answer is yes we'll get into this more stay with [noise]\n... six one hey folks as Michael berry and if you want security or an elegance for your home do what I did called southern front doors quality solid wood front doors force are indoors fiber glass door steel doors and they do back doors to\nThey even do these awesome iron ... we just got one for our house

[laughter] targeted peer former presidents their families cabinet official members of Congress and the free press the objective\nApparently to help out illegal spokespeople for the view of the Democratic party [noise]\nIt was a tack on reporters and on democracy south [noise]\nPeople will say you can't blame the president for something that twisted personally tell them that is true the president said we'll pack now five grind up the shards of glass intended to name and kill\nThat whole thing has\nUndermined American values and ... those are fair to say conduct\nCanada that type of favorites stereotype based on race and religion and political party and it has the potential to me what happened yesterday and we don't even know how far\nAre obvious question is does the president bears some responsibility obviously not for the the bomb making or or the or the recipients of but does he bear responsibility for the tone that allowed a chore\nSure he does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical of him\nBut yeah it does bear responsibility for the divisions are he has the biggest megaphones\nTrump they say is not responsible for the bombs but he is responsible for the bombs\nThat the formulation that you get here from the anti Trump ... that's really what they're saying I I mean I'm I'm not going to tell you that the reason this happened is Trump I'm just saying that Trump is one of the reasons this happened this is why people despise the press the press deserves to be despised Russia's full of a bunch of self important\nCry babies and liars obviously not all people\nI'm In the press technically but a whole vast majority fall into that category\nAnd they have completely jumped the shark here or there not waiting to find out who's responsible for this they're not even putting this on conservative ideology or on the right in general\nThey're going right to the president vicious yet again another attack on the president folks this is trumped arrangements syndrome that we are seeing\nThe president that stages responsible for this guy sending bombs to all these people were so so I just need to understand the president's not allowed to criticize Brock Obama's presidency not allowed to make fun of Hillary Clinton not allowed to\nSay anything nasty about Eric Holder and it is that now the new standard if President Trump were inciting violence meaning you should be violent against people\nOr here or violent acts you should do then he would be guilty of inciting violence I Know this is the problem it leads you have to talk to them like the first graders shorter some of the first graders listening 'cause you're smarter than lives but that's what you have to do you have to walk them through this\nNone other than a Mr fake tapper himself over CNN Today tweeted out that in response to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that the first thing the media did was blamed Trump because that's not the first thing\nWe evacuated CNN which is true in terrible and should not have had to be evacuated because nobody should have ever threaten them and that's an awful thing but then he went on to say no one blames Trump not one person at CNN\n[noise] uh no that's not true\nAnd I know which half or would you 'cause he likes this game he'd say no one blames Trump for the bombs okay that's right no one thinks that Trump was in the west wing putting together these bombs with his bare hands or whatever okay we're in the east wing no one thinks that what's happening but they're all saying including the president of the CNN network\nThat the environment around all of this is from ... creation Trump's fault and the environment led to the bombing so in accidents\nFrom does have responsibility for that is what they're saying\nAnd that's exactly what Mika Brzezinski did because I think her audience at the end at the MSNBC\nDemands it you know the intellectual honesty be damned they simply do not care\nIt does not matter to them that what they are doing is indefensible method is wrong on so many levels to talk about divisions in this country as though there are a bad thing and then two in the next breath maybe even in the next sentence maybe even in the same sentence\nSay that those\nYeah how does one never missed a customer again when customers Paul text or email expressed to me automatically engages them with your digital content\nSimple text flyers coupons menus priceless video audio or anything else expressed to me\nIt's much like sex codes but with voice

commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aid [noise]\n[noise]\nThe president's going to continue to point out contrast the policy between Democrats and Republicans people absolutely have a choice to make\nA on what they believe in and it couldn't be clearer and we're going to see that happen and the next couple of weeks when the elections take place and the president's going to continue to lay out that case but at the same time we're condemning violence and calling on all Americans to come together\nThere is a big difference between I comments made an action taken the president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican baseball field\nThat should be a pretty pretty clear line right the standard here Asian some big shock it's not some huge surprise it's not something that we need to take a step back from an ... hold on a second ... how do we how do we do this how do we deal with this right\nYou are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics you may be responsible for violence if you're directly incite violence and that's why even with our First Amendment there are\nSome exceptions for incitement to violence right if you're in front of a big crowd he said burned down that store across the street and then they burned down that store you or morally called the Boeing and legally\nLiable for that ...\nYou know but but if you say I think we should have lower taxes in this country and then someone hears that and they run down and they like the IRS building on fire you are not responsible for that okay because if that were the case thinking about how that could be abused\nThink about the way this would expand the hecklers veto thinking about how that would shut down discussion and debate anytime somebody wanted to discredit a political believe friday allergy all they have to do is have one person yes that's right and false like fashion\nAct like a complete idiot\nAll they have to do and that everyone says oh see see that and it's just common by the way you see this with this is a a continuation of the debate you have with radical Islam\nThe left will always rush to say the radical Islam is not in any way representative of Islam and then any jihad or jihad is aren't representative of the broader Islamic faith that they will say that\nAnd then when you were responsible hold on a second I mean who are you to who are you to to declare what isn't is not Islamic member Obama set of the un future does not belong to those whose land or the prophet of Islam one of the strangest things us presidents ever said and that kind of form\nA but they'll fight tooth and nail on that one meanwhile if some guy you know somewhere who's white named Billy Bob\nUh says something mean to somebody and and says something racist or whatever to someone\nAnd commits a hate crime that one incident is magnified it did it by the media is oh my gosh there's look at all the hate in this country look at how hateful we there's three hundred and twenty million of us one idiot somewhere did something bad but he's white and male and on the right so that means that the right has to own this whole thing\nBecause because one guy said something racist because one racist incident when is it the exception when is it the norm this is a very important perception game that the media engages in all the time and this is where we can't we can't give any ground\nWe do not have a political culture that embraces mob tactics intimidation and violence similar to what the left as we just simply do not\nDoesn't matter that this one incident this one individual has done this this has been roundly condemned ... with ... there's not a single conservative of any standing anywhere in the country\nWho was that anything other than this is disgusting this person should spend the rest of his life in prison I work with persons probably one guy but we'll see\nBut on the left you'll hear well there's no there's no such thing as mobs really there's no problem with getting up in people's faces and yelling at them there's no reason to demand civility when you're dealing with a political party that his show on uncivil in its ideas according to\nPeople like Hillary Clinton [noise] the left as radical off [noise] we are the ones for holding the torch of American values and freedom and western civilization in this country they're the ones who are kicking the load bearing walls of all of that [noise]\nDo not forget that for one moment in this debate that we're currently having in this country\nDo not let left get away with its lives [noise]\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud\nWhere the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are

French Shawn Davis over at the federal us has the following quote Grassley criminal referrals of ... and sweat Nick also contains new evidence that sweating it has a history of making false rape charges\nUnder penalty of perjury an ex boyfriend says she explicitly threatened to falsely accused him of rape and have him\nDeported\nGrassley has criminally referred ... and sweat next to the deal jaded FBI for three specific felonies conspiracy to defraud the United states oh barring the over broad but\nGot to show both sides live under it um\nFavorite tool of Muller but surely false statements to federal officials and deliberate obstruction of a federal investigation\nWow\nOh yes this needs to happen I think Grassley is no fool Grassley is a serious and very powerful guy in the Senate\nAnd this referral is going to be tough to ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this and that means folks\nThat there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not\nA standard criminal proceeding right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh take their phone records it by the way they are no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane\nAnd I'm so I'm going to say this I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was\nA really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we held the line we kept our shield sigh yes we did we held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending Kavanaugh and we hear in the freedom that we were on that front line publicly\nIn every possible way I was in contact with the White House emails trying to get through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this thing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move and this could this this will mean that the D. O. J. now has the ability to pull records you know they they might\nBe able to see some communications perhaps between sweat Nick and other people but you know this ... you want to play in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean\nThe whole thing if they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July\nThey must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here if they can prove it now\nThere is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague with a statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and\nI think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't but then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fixed but an obvious fix that was when it was clear to anyone paying attention okay this really is\nToo much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now\nBut if they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what if then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie\nAbout what that does to the narrative\nAnd I am very clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer consequences because they're doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life isn't attempted ruin nation of the human beings life\nThat must be punished\nCrystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who claimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina\nThat they do across team rape curbs complete fabrication a total lie which you find a guy was raping her who was miles away and an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card there so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away\nA complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... and he should have gone to prison for a long time but the justice part and\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend stabbed to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today not only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process but if we really do\nCare about truth and decency injustice in our system if we care about due process and\nThe right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right\nNot to be destroyed at the political whims of the left for their convenience than people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick in scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them they know now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that sweating as a liar absolutely absolutely I as I did I Know\nShe's a liar not just based on the statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone spiked punch at a party which what what was that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking much he's drinking the punch how would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's got to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking a drink spiking an entire punch will determine three yeah maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it's none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she'd do range I mean\nAnd that's where they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie\nThe story will be she's not a sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was a sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coughing she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning where does it so I Hope Grassley pushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate\nThis and we'll see how far they're able to be able to take it I think that this could end very\nVery poorly for ... and

we deny anyone in Somalia asylum in this country how can we deny anyone in go down the list\nPlenty of rough countries out there plenty of countries where people just would much rather be in America and I don't blame them for that but it doesn't make them bad people it makes them human I understand this is a great country but if we want to keep this country what it is meeting a country were rules laws respected where we have sovereignty we can't take in everyone\nAnd that's the fundamental principle that the Democrats won't accept and won't adhere to they want to pretend like we really can take in every one and I think in their minds we should chicken every one here's the problem with what Trump is saying that how are you sending\nEight hundred additional soldiers the border of the soldiers because of policy comic taught us they're not going to be doing any law enforcement activities in the U.S interior they are US military there's providing logistic support intelligence support there helping border patrol do the job but they're not the ones affecting arrests that's customs and border well that's border patrol rather\nUm but when people in this caravan turn themselves in at these ports of entry\nThey go into the process for asylum so what that means is they get to tell their story and if boat and border patrol writes it down and try to verify what they can or immigration and customs force rather write that down and verifies what they can\nAnd then those people after a pretty short attention river you can't hold them longer than twenty days because of the floor as consent decree\nThose people are released into the interior of the United states\nAnd told to come back now some of them may come back a lot of them don't but some of them come back\nYou know how do you know what the percentages of those who have been told that they cannot stay in the country eighty five percent you know what the percentages\nOf those who have actually been deported from the country\nLess than Fifteen Percent so\nYou know you you look at these numbers you say oh okay if you get into the interior of the United states you're basically free and clear\nDoesn't matter doesn't matter if you don't actually get asylum and by the way if you get enough thousands of people going through this process from Honduras guess what you're going to even further delay the process but just I didn't really think that we're going to tell three hundred people that are living the United states\nFrom ... you know they came here from Honduras under this program and five years yeah you know what you can't get asylum and we're actually packing your bags and put you on a bus right now\nOr a plane no\nThat's not what's going to happen this is a loophole they are abusing the law as it is written\nAnd we need to deal with this new change and now I don't just want to say all these bad things and not give you some sense of what could be done to fix this there are things that\nThe president can do there are ways that we can in fact address this problem\nUm but it will take some time going to take longer than this caravan will take to reach us\nAnd while this issue is bad for the Democrats right now\nI'm just wait until you have images of women and children at the border crying detained separate that they remember it looks bad right now because it's just this care about all the march and that's what the images are but the imagery which is so important to the politics around this that imagery is going to change\nAnd the imagery as soon going to be look at these people you know the the poor to make the hungry\nAt our border women and children\nBeing treated so terribly by Trump's evil racist government\nJust like what we saw this family separation issue there is there are a few ways really to address this I'll talk about those and then also some other stories and uh I might even give you the a\n... a little bit of a a taste of the spicy a segment today from\nRising which trust me [noise] it's spicy they would [noise] CO [noise]\n\nBack would you know because when it comes to the fight for self taught never saw [noise] what\nWe intended it and I think\nHarry ... cannot have a link or I can get a country that's part of his car and any kind of in our country and well they returned home\n\nOkay that's true but but but\nThey're being coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish\nA record and that just means saying they don't think that's\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American\nImmigrants at the border would would ah would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get to the border\nAnd so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this asylum claims situation and as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced a border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the uh immigrations and Customs Enforcement\nProcess that they are from Honduras um they're going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and as I've been telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright what can be done about this I'm not going to have a bucket or whatever\nThe issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum is that they didn't change the asylum process so that you apply in your\nYou know in your country or in the nearest country you can get two at a U.S embassy and there's a process as it should not be that you just present yourself in this way out of port of entry\nUm because you're in walking within walking distance the United states that's not that's not the way that this law should be but uh\nAs importantly there's something called a safe third party say third country agreement is well I like to tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that his time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some ... crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government to government level with Mexico but what it would mean is that we would set up at the border but on the Mexican side of the border and were you yes we would probably have to pay for this I Know it was a buck and they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it\nWe would set up a centrally trailers you know a holding facility sounds like it's not attention facility but it's a\nWhat would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border\nAnd we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have at port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border\nAnd people that were waiting for their education process so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border\nWhich means that they don't or that they're not able to just go further and further in the interior United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what they they get to stay in Mexico\nOr or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin\nThat way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important we understand is they are not illegal immigrants they may cross illegally\nSo then they are in the U.S illegally but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants go into the asylum process and then they're due process allows them to stay in the United states that\nIs the law I've talked to senior immigration is if a officials about this is talk of lawyers about this that's how this works\nSo we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand that gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border\nOf messages from people that I talked about how they found is the most interesting click we took a long\nTime so I uh I bring you can this be\nCrucial part one point ...\nPercent chance yeah I had aligned to allow and thought that ... percent chance of Pakistan if I find all it all the guys that are going on to care that have a little\nAttached to that at all fat and having an issue that has anything to care of and two it's like an incredibly ... and get to the border\nI'm at you know on a day of election again that's not right in fact I think to have to understand I very much light pole\nSo okay I mean a bruise your Mike right I Want to bring it as an as an impartial observers here you know you can tell it's a little there's a little bit back and forth but I mean there's nothing to do crazy there right now that's good at conversation this is exactly it's the guy's a spirit of conversation\nAnd then things get a little a little more tests like Ninety\nThere was another tweet that said\nThe Democratic party is comprised of racists white liberal that is correct and I write the slight well let's go back and and like I Will say that that many people in the ... part of conversation that I Am concerned about the color and the White House um why why would you ask that question\nThat has to think about like I said well why why we got ten wailing that that's why the draft I stole fact because they can't say I had and about that\nBecause they're bringing a whole crowd that young African American leader so I said that that's something I talk about that in fact many where white liberals don't realize that you put on that\nThe way the economy in that town or a national ... guy had hacked the fat in place that only on how they actually that way I look I I had a conversation that way for her shaved fall and I find that we're shifting away anyway I don't agree with that if they don't let the little quaint at Harvard scholar\nHenry apple pie stabbing ... Congress ... surrounded by way [noise]\nYeah I felt like I got a little like I look at their word yelling it was civil but I felt like a little bit tension there producer Mike\nYeah definitely it was fun I like watching it and I like looking at the [laughter] the this is\nThis is a problem whatever whatever we have a segment like this\nAnd I'm like well that's not really the ... the show every book shut up people are funny [laughter] I'm like well wait I thought I thought we were the trust tree I thought this was a mess that it I think we're all going to supposed to like you know buck slap each other and I'm not even ... there there's more there were I'm like okay because the control room because I kept going beyond replay their\nTheir control rooms like we've got to go to break we got to go to Greg and I'm like okay we're going to break Chris was like no not done I was like\nDamn okay here we go so uh yeah it was a spicy spicy one day we'll get we'll get producer Michael one of these panels\nMan that oh man my could we do that absolutely right yeah\nThe bosses would never be the film that would be the same again buck I Know exactly what Mike Mike slaps will be like new truck bomb it like being left living real quiet on assuming tell them not yeah no no you do your your feisty and I know the Irish are I'm I'm ... I'm One one thousand Native American but I'm half [laughter]\nGood ... thanks right see I I Want to make sure that we got producer\nMike in with the with the objective opinion there because you know for me it's like I mean I obviously ideologically agree with Candice I'm and I I think that she's very talented and but I also am very ah very fond of crystal even though I think that her politics or\nOr I'm\nWrong [laughter] so you know we were just it was it was quite an exchange there and\nUm we'll see tomorrow I'll give you a little preview later on in the show of what the expectation is for a for tomorrow there might be I might be involved in a\nA shall we say more more spirited discussion tomorrow things I might be the one that actually has to do a bit of a a bit of debating but we've got a\nI don't we don't really have time to get to the ... ... the funding to say the men that guys\nThat guy's been treated\n... says well you know we we can actually do a little bit of it so I interviewed Papadopoulos we're this one today\nAnd here's what he said about the notion of Russia collusion play twenty\nGeorge what is what are your feelings now that it it has come out it's been reporting here at the hill that there was exculpatory evidence based on your conversation with an FBI informant\nThat you weren't trying to do anything wrong that you oppose any trees in our collusion that that information may not have been presented to the Pfizer court what do you think about that [noise]\nCourse is for me it's a it's a very sad it was I was impressed when John's reporting but for me it was a sad day to see that uh that was not presented to the price of the court\nAnd then my entire image has been characterized by this false narrative that I Am some sort of patient zero uh about a Russian conspiracy and a a Russian a Coca Cola collusion conspiracy when in fact I have absolutely no Russian contacts whatsoever\nI've never traveled to Russia I don't speak Russian I don't even have Russian American friends are in this country so um when I found myself at the epicenter of this a conspiracy\nAs somebody who actually has no rush of contact something just to not smell right that ultimate\nGeorge Papadopoulos who remember\nWhen when it looked shaky on Carter Page you also had nothing to do with collusion or conspiracy running this stuff\nBut it looks shake it in his owner Papadopoulos that's how the FBI are justified this investigation that that it was supposed to be Papadopoulos I'm telling you people who believe that Papadopoulos was part of some of some crumbling back conspiracy will\nBelieve anything don't believe anything ...\nNorthern rational person could sit down and look at the facts talked to this guy and come away with things that yeah that's right he was trying to throw a presidential election that\nIs utterly insane orderly and said there's just no\nRationale to write all other than it it it explains for some people or gives them an outlet for their anti Trump rage and anything that gives them an outlet for anti Trump raged they are in favor of so if\nSomeone will tell them that there was a massive conspiracy to undermine the election everything and they have to believe that this total ... I don't mean that in a mean way seems like a nice guy\nYou only got fourteen days in jail we've got a felony on his record now which stinks owning a firearm no voting harder to get a job you know can't leave the country probably they usually have a travel restrictions he's got and and also I I don't like that when he talks to me about this there even restrictions as part of his plea agreement about what he can say publicly\nI don't I don't like that you should be able to discuss any aspect of your case once you're once you're through the system there shouldn't be a gag order on you know once your your case\nHas you know once you've served your punishment in your case is done but there was one on him [noise] so it's a battle thing was just nuts and he was testifying today on Capitol Hill which is why we were talking about um better but it's the whole thing is just totally an orderly\nBonkers bill um and I don't know how anybody can sink where they were a year ago and this would just quarter period or Papadopoulos global book no no that was\nTotally orderly wacko let's talk about Megan Kelly getting fired what happened that's coming [noise]\nSo she's making LeBron James money to do a job that a lot of other people could do quite honestly better than her for about a tenth of money\nI in fact there were other people doing the job before that we're getting better ratings and we're making a fraction of her salary people want to but\nExecutives at these places are big public companies places you know NBC and NBC Universal on their own by big paramount or big a parent not paramount parent companies and\nUh you know they could they can determine what the salary is right that's I guess\nWe got shareholders public companies lots of ways to slash the money around without any Bruce or Mike oh no no no my kids say in sixty nine mill none of 'em like I Know that's for now that's her severance I'm In a year in\nSalary that's for her full they're paying out her full contract that's what that's sixty nine\nMill is I'm I'm Talking about you know the uh\nThe year to year so we should make a lot of money but if they go oh she really worth that the answer was no\nUm you know they some of these people will get in touch with the corporate structure at these places and they get huge huge paychecks but anyway\nSo then Megan Megan a had a few bumps here and there I forget exactly what they were but she oh she brought up a Jane Fonda is plastic surgery\nWhich I didn't realize Jane Fonda would be so sensitive about but she was and it was kind of a weird thing to bring up in the interview under the circumstances and that was kind of a bomb for a you know for her to bring up in that way just wasn't wasn't smart\nAnd anyway the latest controversy which has gotten her ousted got booted from NBC\nWhich remember she gets booted right away for this folks you know special\nSex dungeon door closed by button under the desk Matt Lauer guy was there for decades and\nWas the the the chosen one I mean the the face\nOf that network twenty million dollars plus a year I think it was actually making more like Fifteen when he was twenty five million a year they're paying Lauer unbelievable sum of money for a skinny balding we who was completely replaceable by about a hundred different people but\nAndy lack in these people at NBC make decisions like Matt Lauer is that's all you have to do that like you you're good you know it's not about the ratings it's not about the audience really what the what the execs think\nIn the in the east sweet or the C suite the corporate suite east we should be the way it's called so Megan decided and our segment on Halloween and political correctness\nDecided to tackle the subject well that was the subject and and here's what she said well let's start with what she said that got her in trouble John please play said clipped\n[laughter] actually ... you'll get in trouble if you are a white person or a black person if I thought why we like\nA kid that was okay as long as you were trying to find that character traits and there are places in New York with land as she got Diana Ross and she made us get darker than it really is and people said that that was re test\nCould look like an around her one day\nI I don't know how like that that rate hollow\nSo she didn't say anything racist what she said was that\nShe doesn't think that people necessarily dressing in costume when they dark and their skin to be in costume should be considered racist now you could agree or disagree with her I Would note that a lot of you probably liked the movie Tropic Thunder I think it's a very funny movie I think the best part of the movie is uh\nWhat's his name Morton Downey junior right the guy plays Iron Man isn't that his name William ... what's his name again you guys leave me out here to dry well what his name John\nYeah Robert Robert and I'm more Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey Jr more than ... yeah Robert Downey junior show\nSo he uh you know he ... he was in black face in that show I mean in that movie he was he was driven by his pretend to be a black man in blackface and they make\nFun of it during the movie and it works and everything's pretty much it's a funny movie you know there was no picketing there were no people freaking out about it at least not really and I'm moving did pretty well actually\nSo there are situations in which culturally black face has not been deemed to be a insulting and racist I I just named one now I also can understand why given the history of slavery and segregation in this country in the way people use to dress in black face in in in ... [noise] excuse me in mockery\nAh that that would\nBe offensive to some people I I get that and I'm I'm not\nBut I'm just saying that she is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black race under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin is part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they have different anchors coming after NBC just fed her to the wolves on\nThis one and then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet\nStyle show trial forced apology I'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\n[noise] and then her that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness at Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume fooled okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful way by race it in this country it is not okay for that to be part of a costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nNow I could have told her making a call me up and I have a little bit of a soft\nSpot for her because she used to be nice if you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future and that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and\nYou know so so I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore from and kill it I'm just going to be honest about that okay I Do even though I think\nThat she turned over people and bitter horrible decision by going to NBC and was ungrateful for the position jihad at Fox and all that okay fine\nI would've advised her\nBecause I understand how this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of millions of dollars\nIn saying booth it's political terrorism saying that people are evil it is that you disagree with him as saying we would be better off without them means don't justify the ... the ... if the maser stirring up attempted pipe bombings or the people you're demeaning boy ... thirties\nOr the last century isn't this the words per se the action\nI I'm not sure I don't I Can't\nDo that [noise] I don't know why they keep this guy on TV\nI'm not sure if he's the dumbest anchor on television but he's definitely up there definitely close\nUm and you know that this this chorus of people um and uh somebody regime when I was on a special report earlier tonight on Fox News which you can still go check out on mine if you want all I'll put the clip up on Facebook\nI reject I'm Sorry I reject out of hand this\nThis notion that there is\nEqual blame on both sides yeah there's blame on both sides but there is not equal blame on both sides for the political climate in this country are a Trump making fun of journalists who are the most pompous preening overpaid annoying people on the planet as far as I'm concerned\nFrom making fun of them is not tantamount to a fascist state\nMeanwhile people reporting we're supposed to be serious journalist reporting on the existence of a creeping fascism because of Trump's they are doing\nVery real damage to our ability to have any kind of political discussion in this country and they're obviously enhancing the likelihood of there being ugly incidents\nWith all the stuff that we're going on so I I just I refuse to play along the way that they want and say yeah you know what all sides have a problem here how what Trump even that this is something I Want to I Want to leave you with on this and\nThen we gotta talk about Hillary in a moment here get ready for it it's coming how could Trump even comply with what they're saying here let's say Trump came out and said I won't use enemy of the people anymore for the media I won't say that any more do you think that then they'd say oh okay that's reasonable\nYeah you know Trump toning down the rhetoric I guess he's not such a bad guy after all I Know I I guess I guess we've gotta let it\nEven though they wouldn't do that you know that's not what would happen that's not what they say they would say oh that's not even a start to this oh he's so terrible they just want to hate him they don't really want him to change his behavior even if he did change his behavior wouldn't really matter to them\nWouldn't matter so I'm\nJust note that by the way you know one one little sudden I'll throw in there\nI've never really cooked bone and pork chop before and this weekend I'm hoping to ah actually give it a try went to a butcher especially Bush or and got a couple of big thick bone in Port jobs I Want to make a little spice rubbed Fordham\nMaritime overnight try to steer the my cast iron I miss talking to you all about my calling their adventures it's been a while and I haven't\nHad the time to cook recently so this is the I'm gonna try to bring this back because one of those things that when it's done right I just think so incredible is they shared\nA shared bone and pork chop is something special as you can tell I haven't eaten yet and I'm doing this radio show\nAnd I am quite hungry\nSo that's what got me my mind my mind shifted a pork chop land because I'm starving and it's been a long day [noise] um but we do have to talk about Hillary coming up your men roll call and then maybe I'll get this year in myself a pork chop so\nMuch more important stuff coming up so they wouldn't be doing [noise]\n\nScreen than me I think this is Barbara Harris ... you may know the great barrier is known for nutritious university itself benefits so remarkable like neutralizing all full range of free radical threats your body from the sun's rays to normal digestion and everything in between\nNot only more powerful antioxidants are acts helps control sugar metabolism and your body is slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream and green Barry onyx as natural fiber grown within the plant itself so they don't have to borrow fiber as some ... to also bring Barry pancake unlawful cookie brownie\nPatterns that was hard to find nothing hours and local enough to me by phone from happening and what type of Apple's like time [noise]\nDuring early voting ... hanging harmful for your [noise]\nKnees holding the line for America bug sex is back\nJean what can I Do that will uh brighten up your day a little bit it's been a tough week for America right no question about it the market's\nBeen getting battered obviously we've got these ah bombs getting sent all over the country people are being nasty to each other there's mobs everywhere and all that stuff right\nWhat can I Do that will just bring it all home and make us remember you know what it's all going to be okay um well what if I told you that Chelsea Clinton's\nThinking about running for political office I see what I did there that's right I got you ready for one thing and then I pulled out another pack Joe ...\nShe is thinking about it which means she's gonna do it she's gonna do it\nFolks she was talking to the journal news at a stop on the tour for her new children's book starting now you can make a difference just just try to you know she she really needs\nMore cash she lives in a ten million dollar apartment in New York or mom's worth a hundred million\nHer husband is a hedge fund guy but you know what what whatever kind of cash grabs you can go and that's right having children's books ghost written for her\nOh man oh man it's amazing she Chelsea said quote I think if someone were to step down or retire and I thought I could do a good job and it match my talents\nI'd have to think if it's the right choice for me\nShe added she doesn't have any plans to run for office but it's something I think about as I Hope every young person thinks about first of all no\nI Do not want put put aside Chelsea Clinton for a second here why put aside or Chelsea and just know that not every person not every person should be thinking about running for office at all okay there's there's a really very limited number of people that have to kind of a thick skin temperament\nSelf aggrandizing attitude and yes that feel called to serve but increasingly I think politicians are mostly megalomaniac um there there is an increasingly small number of people I think that really should do this\nAnd I think that everybody should I like this is where I Want to talk about term limits I mean this is just this notion that we have the political class that we do and they just stay in power forever is because the system is set up to the people that determine what the system is stay in power but maybe the conversation\nAbout terminals will have to wait for another time I just think that the Chelsea Clinton the notion that somebody would want to vote for this person who's never had a real job\nA and who was sort of let's not forget according to even some leaked emails were started very poorly at the uh you know the foundation the bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton foundation where\nShe was supposed to be a a boss and a figurehead at the same time uh she was not well regarded there are people thought that she acted kind of like the ... boss's daughter which is what she was\nAnd I you know there's just one problem are going to have the right now and I want to get too deep into this but\nWe one thing that we have given up is for for quite a while we're not going to be able to complain about nepotism or just not not with any not without being as hypocritical as the left is so I and I'm not saying that this is the end of the world I'm not saying it's a huge deal", "year": "2018",
