refer to Germany to the American studios\nRadio station your\nVowing to find the culprit I'm Lisa the narrow Fox News President Trump calling on the country to come together after the raid the packages containing pipe bombs were sent to high ranking Democrat and CNN New York offices\nThis is ... just people are losing their minds about the politics on this I mean they're they're so vicious and nasty and a desirous of\nAttacking one another as human beings and his people on and doing so with the most vitriolic terms they can think of\nA this is obviously a political discussion as well\nIt's going to be reconsider I considered gel you'll look later on the show up and up Joe Jones joined us these marine Rio de walk us through everything we\nAbout these bombs I had a little bit of bomb training myself back in the day and the CIA so you know ... will ... and ... also dealing with terrorism investigations which often involve a bombs in IDs\nSo we'll walk through that component of it but but the overwhelming focus of the media is already are going to be about assigning blame and\nUh and settling scores you're quite honestly and and make sure that there is a maximum\nPolitical impact\nAt either you just heard that statement for ...\n... says there's no place for political violence in this country and Jeff Zucker over CNN CNN is one of the places where they had this suspicious package and they did all their coverage today from outside of CNN and\nA ... year Jeff Zucker released this official statement from CNN the president of CNN released this in ... ... ... you know President Trump had already said what are the audio that I played for you of\nYou know there's no place for for political violence in American society none or threats not and that's the president says\nHere's how the president of CNN response\nQuote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter though so far they have shown no comprehension of that\nThis isn't just disgusting low blow from the president of CNN that's what this is\nThis is it the president's fault that some lunatic this is the president of CNN saying it's it's the president's fault the president's words that are tied to this in some way right away without even knowing\nWithout even knowing who this is what the real motivation is\nThis is the this is a disgrace\nAnd there's no shortage of this rhetoric coming from people now they they view this as a means of getting even with Trump now you know\nAnd they also view this as wiping away what had become a very powerful narrative because it was so true that the left is a bunch of screaming mob ing maniacs\nNow they're going to say oh it's both sides now now the the the entirety of the Democrat power apparatus\nAnd all of its all of its media wings which CNN is certainly one of them\nAre going to claim victims status over this all the way up until election day before we even know who did it before we know anything about what they've done and you know I I'm Sorry but I Do not remember I Do not remember the head of Fox News or the head of\nYou know it and forget about the head of it and they do not remember ah the the biggest names in the business that I Am in\nRush Limbaugh Sean Hannity or you know Glenn Beck I Do not remember any of them\nSaying oh it's it's the fault of CNN for example it's the fault of CNN that a Bernie Sanders supporting lunatic actually shot Steve ... and he almost died\nAnd tried to shoot a whole bunch of conservative members of Congress\nBecause of their insane rhetoric because of their that they've been calling the president and the United states oh trader a Russian huge a crazy person a rapist or racist white nationalist effectively a clan member\nAnd they said he's destroying the country he's undermining our institutions someone must take action someone must do something about this\n\nAnd here we are here we are\nAt a point where finally there is a moment where the Democrat power structure feels like they are\nUnder threat and I and I I Am the ... I you know I Am consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas you don't do it nobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting\nIt's illegal it's immoral and it's if you really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side might have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and and evil and stupid on every level\nBut it's the Democrats who have been trying to blur these lines for the last six months or so\nAnd if the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president and as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe the front of the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear\nWar if you believe those things then taking extreme measures does not seem like such a leap does it they have not been pushing\nBack on Trump for tax reasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same vigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasies that they have conjured around Russia collusion and\nTwenty Fifth Amendment of Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now and now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened\nAnd this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened Jeff Zucker now I can sit here and say without\nAny feelings of of ah she position is\nThat my criticisms of CNN all stand\nCNN is a dishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that age furthering division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta and others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots that the Republicans in the president maybe they're actually going to criticize you back with words with words they're allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I can also sit here and say I am happy to hear that no one at CNN was hurt that I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't\nI Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work on skates and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical\nAbout immediately trying to make it or will you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn these bombs being sent to us but also\nContinue to criticize us no I I I can and will\nAnd it's not just CNN it's all these other\n... you know it it's it's George Soros is doing\nThe funds incredibly destructive incredibly destructive programs for freedom in for liberty in America I mean he he he is behind a lot of very bad stuff um and then when you out of you know then you add into this also obviously the the Obamas and the Clintons and people who are ideological opponents\nDoesn't mean that I hate them I Do\nRespect the Clintons but I mean I you know I I disagree strenuously with the Obamas I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I'm allowed to not respected that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their beliefs for that\nMatter but not not even a day passes not even a day passes\nFor us to deal with this issue to figure out who's the hottest to figure out what's going on or without it being used right away in the most obvious fashion to score political points but I'm just going to say the Democrats think this is the way they can actually then ensure they win the house and maybe stop it\nLeft his already trying to shape this whole thing though to their advantage it's just so they don't want anyone else to do any of that so no one else can be political Democrats [noise]\nBecause they are victims of of course\nBy the time for the most iconic brand into booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now high time investor dot com dome is your chance to be part of history and I'm making busy at high time investor dot com that high times investor dot com\nHigh times holding corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investigating shares of common Sacco [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that that is that\nYou know this feeling that the targets as these particular devices as we've been reporting so far are all connected to individuals\nThat the president specifically and has political allies have been attacking\nThese are all people who have been or are perceived to be critics of the president who have been the subject of his criticism very directly\nIf you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and people are going to act out and there's no human being more responsible for the climate weren't than Donald Trump\nThe president and his allies the need to dial down the political rhetoric and they are making people laugh they they are making journalists last day and they're making law enforcement officer is let's say\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media\nBut there's an obvious thread the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually patentable demonized is\nWho I Believe the heated rhetoric toxic environment\nIs part of this [noise]\nYes we're in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president can the United states\nIt's all the president's ball you see\nAlmost everything that goes wrong in this country according to the left is Trump's fault\nIf someone is a in a high profile sexual assault case Trump's fault if someone says something mean to someone somewhere it's stressful if someone engages in a hate crime or says something racist somewhere it comes from all these people are nuts\nThey have really lost it and\nYou know that there's this whole to Jake Tapper Trump is demonizing M. O. as if the media doesn't demonize the president and those around him by the way we CNN makes it very clear that\nThey will not be happy until ... some of the top people in the White House or arrested I mean they want them to go to prison that that's clear from their coverage they want to see them in cells the left doesn't just want Trump to no longer be president\nThey want him to be ruined and destroyed an error concocting narratives to achieve\nThat they're not just hoping for they're trying to make it happen I've talked to a quarter page I've talked to ... he's got\nThis whole thing is we're Jewish about Russia collusion it's insane and what does Russia\nCollusion really at its core what is it all about Trump as a traitor that's what they're telling Trump is guilty of treason that's what they're saying I'm not making this up I'm not exaggerating\nPress the United states is a creature according to meet your media is a trader according to Democratic Party with no evidence but nothing\nAnd they want to talk about demonizing place\nOr I Know we don't often take that many calls here because I could socialize city we have every single line late and I know there's a lot more people that are when did you get in and I want to hear from you on this so uh let's get to it a first up Tim in Phoenix welcome to block sections show\nNew ... and my ... friend\nShe'll

like\nLasted in the media and I'm not saying it's changed shame than their share Carol Dan\nJim I had a little bit of a soft on a little tough time here you're saying that this changes the narrative away from damaging things for the Democrats\nYou bet\n... that just as that is true it does do that so there's no question about that they'd much rather talk about this in Trump's rhetoric and how bad he is and then I mean the caravan was a loser for the lap which they didn't figure out until too late and and they're still hoping that everyone just forgets about what they didn't know Kavanaugh situations so absolutely\nNo I don't know I'm waiting for you yeah I'm\nActually calling into shields uh uh we've got Charlie in Maryland hey Charlie\n... thanks for taking my call book I just got a question you dealt with the FBI and their investigation of this a bomb threats\nAnd it turns out to be a ... a less deep political move\nWho realize that the mob narrative was really hurting a conservatives I'm Sorry hurting or the left and\nThat this was a whole shift in the national conversation on politics right before the election\nThey may be successful in\nInterfering if you will and the election with this whole a horrific plot\nAnd if we do know that until after election that's just going to be the way it is so it's a lot of\nThreads coming together here and we have very little

have this\nWe didn't have this outpouring immunity from all these Democrats\nAfter the uh let's just be honest about it much more serious in that somebody was almost killed somebody was shot shooting at the baseball diamond Alexander I did not see all these Democrats daytime and take the temperature down let's stop calling trumpet trader what stopped calling Trump\nSupporters white nationalist and racist I didn't see any of that I I just\nDon't remember ... maybe maybe my memories faulty\nAlthough I doubt it that was not what was happening was it now we see that the capitalize on this they try to capitalize on this right away\nSome are more explicit than others here is the view host sunny hopped in ...\n\nI was in ... thing with my former colleagues to CNN and and they're scared and one highly former colleagues said this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the ... plus high and I thought my gosh you know it's it's the tone and coming from the top\nAnd now than it has become a target journalists that are simply Chinatown we still don't know anything yet about where this is coming from and what the motive as an end to the person or the people are behind it though I I can point to the careful 'cause we don't know yet but I didn't get the by you know they have a hard\nLiners hasn't gotten a bite yet\n\nIt's but it's Trump's fault you see I'm I'm not saying that\nThere's not a correlation here between or or clear link between all these different yeah these are these are powerful Democrats who have been targeted but that they've been targeted doesn't tell us why they were targeted as in the motivation the ultimate motivation of the perpetrator\nAnd connected to the president is just it just disingenuous a disingenuous I really doesn't have any evidence there's ... there's nothing to hide this together that they think that Trump is mean to them sometimes well do they go to determine when Trump is not being mean to them\nDo they get to determine when Trump has finally been acceptable in his expression of criticism about the media one of the best and most powerful things that Trump has done is to challenge the media and to call them out for their biased and their wives\nI don't want him to stop and I refused to allow the left wing media\nTo use this incident to stop it [noise]\nIt's a crazy world out there will come up with all

criticize a matter of what he does\nWhether it's cause show gay or this or anything they just they hate him they absolutely hate him\nYou know earlier today actually there were just talking about the president's such a liar oh he's such a liar so terrible notice you know my objection to Obama that I thought he had bad ideas he wasn't nearly as brilliant as the media pretend that he was and he was arrogant and he was doing bad things from policy level\nActually don't have any personal beef with Obama like I didn't I didn't know it wasn't about Obama the guy seems like he's a very nice family seems like he's a good dad I mean there there's a lot of stuff actually I look at Obama signal that's that seems admirable\nBut I thought he was a bad president and I disagree with them I didn't hate him though I didn't go to\nBed and I think all that that that come Obama wasn't some maniac but that's how they feel about Trump and now because some maniac\nSomewhere we don't even know why yet but

that kinda thing to me in a bit of the fat free frenzy frustration and health oxygen sales why\nThis is a an an article of faith now have you have to say this all the time when ever asked them what what's\nThe lie looked really damaging pernicious live what is the lie on the level of if you like your healthcare plan you can keep it that President Trump has told one that was done with forethought with malice and that had impact on the lives of tens of millions of Americans\nNegative impact what what is the law that lines up with that but that his crowd size was the biggest ever that he's a stable genius you know a lot of the stuff that he says you and I can recognize as him kind of joking around and talking as normal people do\nThere oh he's a liar oh he's lying you know they're they're always I always jump right to the worst possible\nScenario and never get tired of it either oh my gosh you know the the left in the media they they find endless ways to reach a Lebanon the outrage meter China's not enough eleven the outrage me in regards his brother\nI Know I I just get frustrated with it too it's it's so tiresome and they're all their calls for civility right there there are being made in bad faith they're not calls for civility they're not really from a lot of these a prominent leftists\nTheir calls for the right to be silent and to start getting pummeled again they like the old order where we sit around and were polite and we can we as conservatives play by the rules and were nice and we get punched in the face and say oh that was nice but I'm going to keep doing what I Do that's what they want us to go back to Trump doesn't play that game\nThey're not saying let's all go to each other day defend them up in the restaurants we'll talk more about that later they defend these tactics that it's not just that they happened and they say oh well we can't control everyone there favorable\nTo this stuff and now they're saying we all have to be civil and take the temperature down after Eighteen\nMonths of propaganda diving to their base the president's a traitor or sexist or rapists or a you know a racist a everything crazy going to start a war is a fascist they stopped they said about President Trump but it's like nothing I've ever seen in my life it is like nothing I've ever it truly is that there's nothing that even comes close\nNow they're going to be the stability please come on\nWho takes this seriously these people are\nThese people are really in need of a reality check 'em really and you got Joe Scarborough Scarborough if I if I just can't for a minute here I don't know Joe Scarborough never met him dumping the care to a but this is a guy who\nWas his chummy chummy buddy buddy with the president as you could possibly be during the ... when it really mattered as a journal to be an objective for and at a scar wasn't opinion guy but you know he's a member of the media and he had an opportunity to speak truth to power and all that but no he wanted to be cozy with power he wanted to be close to power\nAnd now because Trump has not him in Mika\nA now because Trump has stumped with is not the two of them he he goes on these anti Trump rage rants\nAnd first to him today is on Christ like I mean this is here's what's covers that play six\nHistory will look back and Americans will look back with shame that we ever had a president like this one a vet turned his back on the most basic [noise] not only the most basic American concepts\nAre we defend our borders and and we should defend our borders people should only getting here legally what Donald Trump's doing is\nNot only anti American\nI Will just say this is a guy that was raised Southern Baptist church\nAt least based on\nThe Bible I read the gospels that I read the good Samaritan story that I read it sounded Christ like\nYeah that's right Joe Scarborough is going back to is oh so Christian roots and a side in the Bible to criticized Trump I mean this guy has no shame no shame whatsoever\nI mean he goes over at MSNBC and uh ... that show up for sale in the morning I hear so\nMuch blather and so much nonsense as long as it's anti Trump you know the audiences you it's good to like the that works really it really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends and you know I'm here in the swamp and what you find out more\nAnd more is that so many of these folks that that think that they're standing proud for the truth the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck in their own access all the time\nThey don't know what they do if they weren't doing his job and they just want to get us cause you to power responsible and they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit\nAnd there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just that this is a media war\nWere limits of media war the notion that those who started this war in the mainstream media are the ones who were not calling for civility is just preposterous\nReally is um I went to argue about the mobs and all that coming up in a moment but ah\nWe have we have ... much more just 'cause I don't want to be labor at this point today because we don't know enough about the bombs I Do have Joey Jones coming on a little bit to talk about what we know about the devices themselves will get to some of the technical aspects of this uh we're all really up to speed on that and and also just what it takes to um you know get some of these\n... some of these devices were kind of skill set or we really talking about so we'll we'll get into that I'll have an update for you on the on the caravan coming up\nA which is all of a sudden out it's really going to drop out of the news cycle very quickly and I think it's because Democrats realized this does not the the Democrats pushing all of a side in their quest to do everything they can for illegals not I'm not a winning issue for them and they they don't doesn't work out the way they think it's going to work out ever\nUm we're that an and much more if you want to call a for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred book I'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fried where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this is the foot of taking out loans using bucks homeless equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments her victory notices showed up\nIn that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock\nWhen really of knowledge and that's part of the political coalition on either side\nAnd that's from a Republican folks [laughter] it's from a duck and yet at MSNBC never forget this these media elites that are not talking about civility uh they they have disdain for Trump voters to they think that people like you and me\nAre beneath them\nThat we're contemptible but we're gross that we are um uncouth on educated\nAnd you know ill bred you know we are bad and that\nIn fact a lot of the way that they yes they report the news and they share information and and just their perspective their point of view is tainted by that it's not just Trump that they despise just like whenever I talk to you about the second amendment it's not it's not really about guns about gun owners\nAnd with Trump don't let them get away with oh it's it's well some of them will be very open about it it's not just Trump it's Trump voters\nThey don't just despise the man and his policies they despise all of us who\nHave put our faith in him to get the job done in fact they despise us so much that they refuse to believe is very important if you can't understand the Trump phenomenon without knowing that he's in that role for very specific reasons we've been trusted him to do certain things that by the way he has been doing\nUm and\nTo shake up the political establishment to take the fight to the left and you push for less regulation less taxation\nAll of the things that Trump has been pushing for it and doing that's why he's here he's not there because we think that he never flies off the handle a little bit maybe a little too salty with his language you know as a little bit too much of a a\nMaybe an excessive libido in his past him and all of those things that those those are and it's not that we are not aware of those and it's not that I think those are good things it's just that on balance I Want all the good stuff that Trump brings to the table and he's doing that but the Nicole walls of the world the world too stupid to make that kind of a calculation\nOr they want to hold it to the Romneys standard of put an ineffective Boy Scout up there so we can tear them apart and then we'll pass you on the head when we put another leftist in who destroys the economy and socialized medicine that's what they want to do\nThat's the plan I I'd rather not I'd rather not allow that to uh to happen or not not on my watch if I could avoid it away or\nRussia collusion fall out of the headlines tomorrow but I have George Papadopoulos on rising with me so if you want to see that very interesting interview uh but I wanted to know something 'cause you know this guy's got some prison time\nAnd for what I have a felony on his record now and the whole thing is such a joke around him but here's a congressman ice it talking about this play eight\n\nWe're going into an election in which real wrong doing two years ago is still not properly investigated well a special investigator Mohler is continuing to indict people for unrelated crime is an active though there's collusion when he hasn't had one piece of it then he's been able to demonstrate so\nThey the voters are going in with some very interesting misinformation or lack of information and two years is a long time it's too long and we should have deposed him today\nYep I completely agree with ice in one part of this whole election that we don't talk about enough\nIs how it is tainted by dish a deep state action against the president not just the effort to create this false Russia collusion narrative but also the mole or pro which Grimes along and what these trumped up oh conspiracy against the United states charges this stuff is crazy\nIt's nonsense and that affects\nVoting that affects people's mindset about this president and really profound ways so you know the the left is already stacked the deck there already cheating\nIn a sense already playing dirty and\nWho knows how much dirtier I told you you guys remembered as I said it's a couple of weeks ago I think we've got another October surprise you know I sent it on the show we got something else it's going to hit us\nAnd I can't tell you exactly what's going on today but I can tell you that well certainly a surprise um we've got to have a Joe Jones joined us on the ... of those bombs and we're gonna talk about the caravan so much more showgirl switching topics shortly set right there with me team you're about [noise]\n[noise]\n\nExactly you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise] so the big\nStory they folks is about comics that have been sent to be in the mail in some cases maybe hand delivered I Want to bring somebody on who is a true\nBomb experts we have with us Johnny ... Jones now he is a a former marine and he was an EEO detect so he was all about explosive ordnance disposal Johnny Was was wounded in combat in his role as an EEO detect\nAnd that he knows everything about these devices how they're built\nHow you tracked them and what they can do a job and great to have you on that thank you so much\nYeah thanks for having me on today\nAll right so from what we know right now let's just go to the what what can we what can\nWe say about these devices sponsor pipe bombs any signatures any sophistication or lack there Rob what's notable to you about these bombs\n[laughter] well you know I can only go off really the the information ... and and the one picture that's out there so I Want to put that out front say it's purely speculative are just going up what we see what we hear 'em and so what we saw it looks like a pipe bomb\nAnd it had some sort of timing device on the outside of it ... it for both the it's\nAnd the idea there is this is a functional bomb what you would have the bomb did either\nOnce that time or hit a certain time pre determined time in its past life it would\nTurn on a lie or sell the noise and so what you do you take that same signal that same electrical signals to re route that into a circuit that that makes the bombs so that\nOne normally the light would come on the bond that ... normally the bell wondering when an alarm clock the bond that nature um the other way it could have been used would be to arm it so that folks switches of breaking a circuit than an arming a and arming mechanism is another breaking the circuits so circuits still open\nBut once the arming gets closed and the next thing they closed the switch full set it off so we know and and the use of timing devices\nThey're used for one or two things either to determine when the bomb goes off for to keep yourself as the bomb maker\nTime to get away from it before it's on and so if this bomb is a functional device which I have my own doubts that are suspicious about what I could see in that picture but if it's a if it's a functional device and we certainly have to treat it that way then we would call this the time devise a out of their time to arm or trying to detonate\nAnd being that it was going to seal package and there seems to be no other true mechanism of of the nation than we can have to believe from what we can see from that picture\nFor that at the time to detonate device meaning they said you know a certain amount of hours on that timer and when it runs up it was their radically detonate\nNow that's going to be a very I mean I I Would assume Joey you in this this is going to be a very\nUh ... with his sloppy way in and try to target an individual right Emmy assuming this was actually sent through the mail to just have a timing device on it and you'd have to be guessing when it would be you know it sounds like it's more likely could blow up still risk to people could really could kill somebody who could blow up\nIn the mail processing center in the mail man's hand perhaps or eight on any number of phase is not including the targeted individual\nWell you know it's it it becomes one of those talking points where I really need to think through how much it is going to divulge and detail to any audience because you just never know who's listening that certain things that you know our best are best kept secrets keep us alive or not go into too much detail\nAbout how boundary made about Ninety percent of what you put into a bomb as readily available at Walmart and the information on the Internet there's one or two components really one specific part of the bomb that is really hard to make yourself and it's even harder to get a hold of manufactured\nAnd and so what we have right now is if this is a fleet of I speak meaning that it\nCould function as as as it appears to\nThen uh then that components within the pie and if they can exploit or take apart what is there to recover some of those pieces then perhaps there some signatures so specific parts of the pieces that gets\nMore easily point isn't the right direction when I Would say where do you really I'm just like an off in a shipping of the package if\nYou know the one that we're looking at now seems to be ... hand delivered by courier but there's questions about the postage and was it actually put through a a delivery service or\nThat someone just hand this package this went outside and say hey I'll give you twenty dollars to take this and that you already we don't know and those those lead those humanly\nThe tracking the shipment that's the first place will go in the meantime someone probably over at Quantico with the FBI utilize some tools techniques we have this safely disassembled Islam\nFor my family planning part of a lesson for five of them from about ... or ... for ... ... ... seven seven fifty\n[noise]\nWe can you hear and you know last week although actually following you are doing this I mean I I must have pen people have been yelled at until they had to leave restaurants all conservatives is that okay with you know I Am okay with Sarah Sanders secretary Nielsen\nAnd Mitch McConnell yes Michel ... is more dangerous salmonella in that restaurant any why Hillary Clinton tried and I walk up to an hour into but I I\nIt it's not clear that there was Hillary she leans Seventy something being unpleasant and something being okay I'll take your protesting something you're disagreeing about you know I I if I get paraded children from their parents and I went to dinner and a Mexican restaurant I wouldn't ... high endorsed certain Harlem\nSo there you have the big separation okay I especially in a day like today where we're going to be a lecture by the left about about civility all of a sudden keep in mind that that exchange that was until you're crossing show not tonight but last night\nUh that exchange was between a very senior and trusted Clinton Hillary Clinton aide Felipe rains and of course Tucker\nWho people will say looks like book so it's bucking took\nA or people say that I look like Tucker but they don't know if they don't know anything because clearly Tucker looks like me uh but they're having a search engine you notice that that he makes it clear rains makes it clear that to him and this is true of many other Democrats are I Know\nThe harassment and stocking and mob tactics of the left against politicians are people they don't like\nThat is acceptable they don't\nSay oh sorry this is just some other thing you know this is just some other group that we don't we don't endorse or we're not associated with this isn't representative of us\nThey actually try to justify this behavior and I keep having to point out to people that the the line between if are at a restaurant and forty people were up in my face and I was with my girlfriend or my spouse or whatever or or even just the family members or friends\nAnd people were cursing at me and yelling at me and threatening me the line between that activity and someone getting their nose broken on either by me or\nBuy them right I mean on one side or the other is that line is\nVery thin very small all it takes is one person who thinks they're going to give you a little shy of one person who just crossed easily they're already screaming your face they're already yelling at a restaurant there already embarrassing you humiliating you and trying to intimidate you\nYou really think that art for one of them to all of a sudden you know give a little shrug it a little push and things get out of control\nYou know the answer to that\nBut what so important is that the less I you know as soon as those idiots when after Nancy Pelosi I said an every other conservative but I Know and and respect came out and said those people are are more on\nWhat they're doing is a disgrace and not only is their behavior wrong but by acting in that way and they they really did the progressive left or to the ... the wing of the Democratic party a big favor\nA boat oh by the way they talk specifically about that and rains 'cause they they have to pretend there's some consistency Rangel's say as he did a Carlson oh no that's okay what did it blows he's okay put Twenty one\nSo is it okay to scream at Nancy Pelosi until she leaves her restaurant and the answer is no it's not okay I'd never okay I think what happened when Nancy Pelosi was fine\nThe other day she was ... and ... she was with her to do any you don't see any of us up and said Nancy Pelosi I'm going to yell at you until you leave the palm because you have a ... policy I disagree with [noise]\nI think in all first one they got a call ... ... what happened was I just don't do it because they're not ... in the last ...\nLook I think it needs to be said and I appreciate the Tucker set it and you know thank God that people like soccer have the kind of platform may do or they can push back on this nonsense conservative we had a political culture\nAnd in our political culture in this country is unacceptable to a you know surround people when they are engaged in private activity now who say they're in public but I mean they're not\nThey're not out of you know they're not on stage they're not and look I think the behavior when they're on stage it's just it's just different degrees right it's one thing if you want to make a lot of noise and heckle people on Capitol Hill I think that's childish and stupid and you should get arrested but I don't think you know I don't I don't think this is certainly dangerous to the people right at the Capitol police there and there's you know those cameras there\nBut when you're in a restaurant and you think that you know it was ... where does that stop\nWhat about waiting for somebody outside their home\nYou know I Wonder what Democrats think about that can forty people wait wait outside your apartment in in uh on Capitol Hill or in downtown Washington DC if you're a member of the house the Senate\nAnd and they can they follow you can they follow every you go you know this whole notion of there in public so they can be a target of our disdain now oh they're in a restaurant I mean I really get angry when I hear them a Democrat\nSaid things like oh sorry the kid just you know enjoy the frog legs as they sit there at the table well people are losing their health care of and justice childish talking points stupidity you know you're a lot of the older the ... the roast chicken while the poor people out in America are suffering right I mean\nThey they try to create this whole narrative justify the whiny childish ... which is really a very\nCommon and very widespread characteristic of\nActivists Democrats their whiny screaming children and they act out and they throw tantrums and then they want the media to tell them that those tantrums are okay and the media does an important political figures I mean as much as you think he's got Felipe rains are Ryan represents names important\nSo this is this is the distinction they're not hiding that they're okay with this behavior not only do they do this stuff and we really don't or at least we rarely our side rarely does they celebrate they endorse when their side is engaged in mob tactics and they really hope that the American people forget that\nBefore election day [noise] really interesting study I saw this week about how people ah don't really trust Facebook that much anymore will that's really not surprising is that when you see all of the stories out there about shadow banning about\nGaining the algorithm so bad it pushes progressive causes\nAnd shuts off discussion about things like the second amendment about free speech about any number of issues that are really important too\nConservative that's why we need a space where there's none of that agenda or censorship [noise] nippy dot com maybe dot com is a new social media platform that you can join and share your thoughts and know that

N. I. P. P. Y. dot com again ... dot com no censorship no agenda let your opinions be heard\nNippy dot com let's get the discussion ... [noise]\n\nNot being able to tell them this is true the Democrats in general they are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they really believe\nAnd maintain their electoral prospects you know they're they're the ones you always have to play this game on things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where he said you know you can't you can't sneak into this country it's not allowed or we're not going to let people just surge into into this place\nSome people as a I think it was ... to the New York times wrote oh I thought Obama was you know we're so are you know so pro illegals it's like yeah he's lying when he says that he wants to secure the border she can't she can't figure that out apparently\nA buddy buddy you see this time and again we're the left is just being dishonest about\nWhat they really want and um you know this this was new you have ah MSNBC where the guy blaming the Reagan Administration for they play quid tend please say that they also\nNeed to call out the fair Margaret Traub is normally one other thing I Would add to that when Democrats should not\nTo say is that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of conditions created by Republican foreign policy particularly in the Reagan Administration so we have a problem with the images we can go back over time and see why these countries on the condition that they're at\nThat's right folks it's American foreign policies fault that Honduras is a a hell of a whole of crime and corruption and and violence it's America's fault you see\nEvery country anywhere in the world that's in bad shape is somehow are full that's the view of the left and it also informs their immigration policy don't think that that's just a throw away\nBecause the progressive in this country believe that America has only becomes so rich and powerful on the backs of the third world and essentially the non white regions of the globe\nThat is a widespread left wing belief you see it in in uh in academia you see it and media uh this is not unusual at all\nAnd in fact some of the Obama administration approach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the ... and the apology toward America has a lot to apologize for\nAnd the dysfunctions in Central America are somehow according to left is the fault of America and therefore we shouldn't be saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force the American taxpayers to subsidize\nAll the dysfunction all the problems in Central America that's not fair they say oh no no no you\nOwe that to them and see this is a fascinating and very destructive world view of the left has but it informs the Democrat parties foreign policy and the basics of it are that anything that we\nHave to do when it comes to immigration and one of the weather is taking in refugees are taking it illegals that is going to be exact cost upon the American taxpayer is completely justified\nBecause we owed them you see it's our fault that these countries aren't more prosperous are so corrupt um it it's always our fault and less view and really what it is a globalized victim allergy\nRight that that other countries there people are victims of the United states and therefore the Democrats need to be in charge in this country to make amends for all that victimization I Know it's\nLike we're sitting and and having some kind of a psychiatric session whenever we talked with the Democrats but that's just where they are they have unfortunately embrace than ideology that is detached from reality [noise]\n\n[noise] I think about the timing may your business than to attract the best talent [noise] what was your office that attracted him point today's workforce once in office has no an accurate down day standing desk solution help Ukraine him occupied state where employees\nHappier healthier and more productive dairy products requiring little to no family income is at thirty days rich began the brown on their product at dot com slash media that the ...

he now that we're going forward progress move my progressive policies and we're looking ahead and I think she represents an old Democratic Party\nHillary Clinton's a rallying point for the right they

not\nReally accepted where or what happened they they haven't really accepted that Trump won that's why there's such a fixation on your coming up with some explanation for how Trump cheated
