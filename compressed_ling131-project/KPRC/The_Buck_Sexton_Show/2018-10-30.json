oh grouper sorry my bad what did you catch any fish oh flounder I Gotcha what would you catch anything\nSo no you didn't catch anything I cos if I ask if you're caught in the founder and you say I caught some catfish than the answer to my question\nA caught in such a horrific circumstances this and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer and ah and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country and yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without a moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than they make this about Trump these people who do this\nEvery day on every issue at all times are are sick they have\nA problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective\nYou know last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy who had already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run in at a uh a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticizes people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted they can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals\nBut they say that Trump is basically\nResponds well did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't\nPack the bombs himself and not Trump wasn't wasn't crushing up glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that stupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way and what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc covered in Trump's stickers covered and all this\nPro markup paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's the terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump has just raised hate in America\nLet's be clear that that means that not Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges and they hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country\nLet's say you know be ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremist let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's from Wall because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because she has implicitly encourage them they'll say if a anti Semite who is anti Trump ... you know you got on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\n\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness at it's at the root of it all ages crumbs fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that I Can't even begin to fathom\nI I I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live and breathe politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such are talking about sometimes you know I'm like what do they what will play something for you later you know here's what is that even me\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions I mean this is how you know\nThat the left cannot be taken seriously on this they will try to escalate rhetoric while saying that rest a rhetoric needs to be de escalated\nThey'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents let them beach you into submission bludgeon you into\nSilence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is\nNothing to do with their calling President Trump an anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Trump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish his son in law's Jewish market convert to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti\nSemite not even a little bit not even close\nBut they say this media says they pat themselves into that oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power no\nYou're punch of destructive\nLittle individuals that are saying this it's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else\nWho hate the president who justify this his position for Jews decides\nTo be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy\nTrying to track attached drawn to this though it's just so intellectually dishonest it show unfair and\nGoes to show you that there is there was no effort in good faith there's no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault\nPress drive I I agree with Trump and that the press does drive a lot of this because the press is full of a bunch of training\nSelf obsessed self righteous jerks not\nAll of them obviously and I know that you do a book ... I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nThey're not honest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists\nPosing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they're the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else that exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility they take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story all critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they were tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because if the if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and the in the direction of the country right now and how we're all doing\nThis country is doing very well this country is on the right path\nFrom the top of the Democratic party enemy the apparatus Iran's all the time when\nYour\nAll of that is true then by all of it reiterate all of it\nRepeating all of it I mean it it is what needs to be said here in this moment of oh we'll need to come together really easy to come together here's like well here's what they put on TV\nOver at MSNBC the\nPolitics editor their here's where he has to say about Trump when we're all supposed to come together now play twenty four\nAs much as I may have criticisms of how law enforcement operates in this country they are still our line of defense against maniac and terrorists out there uh but but I I have to say nickel and this has always been a problem with this president he has always shown a sympathy already dismissing this towards terrorism\nOr he is a ... he's a a terrorist sympathizers or I mean given the way the he responded what happened in Charlottesville given how he responded to show the given the fact that he he puts what's happened today in through this week and the concept of how it affects the midterm elections we don't have leadership in this\nCountry when it comes to domestic terrorism this president foment but uh as much as he is occasionally forces speak against it a\nTerrorist sympathizers MSNBC politics editor calls the president of United States\nHow much more stupidity do we have to really be subjected to before we just said I I just don't want to hear from these from these idiots anymore\nI just I just can't I Can't ... I Can't even pretend to engage and here there are arguments I I feel this from friends of mine they say I'm just sick of it and I understand the feeling sometimes\nYou know and and I spend a lotta time drawing a lot of left us and it is it is no easy task these days you know what this really comes down to and this is what they don't want to tell you they know that they are not going to win the Senate and they know that the house is going to be tight and the left is aware\nSomewhere deep down that Trump was anywhere near this monster this caricature that they've been saying for all this time\nThen Trump should get blown out his party should get blown out in the mid germs right it should be wipe out in favor the Democrats what does it say that almost two years into the Trump presidency who they say is a traitor and a fascist in a bigot and a rapist and all these horrible things what does it say\nThat the party that has led by that guy\nIs going to gain Senate seats and almost even though it's an off year election hold on to\nThe house of representatives\nHow much more out of touch and diluted can the Democratic party be that's the question they don't want to have to do it's just so much easier for them so much more satisfying to say that it's just all about how Trump is a race just at a terrorist sympathizers just not true [noise]\nThe commercial airline industry

okay and that's why yes there are always been a anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism go hand in hand with the ... the entire idea of anti Semitism is conflict shoes outside the body politic outside the death of ... of ... and that's like Donald Trump does that mean that is what his party is now committed to doing\nElimination his rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point he doesn't dog whistle continues as megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him\nAnd this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not somewhat\nOr partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend\nIn the Washington Post no less saying that uh it is directly somewhat you know that ... they'll always put his qualifier it's Trump's fall to the extent you\nKnow or you know drawing Trump shit old some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the individuals in the media who\nHave taken Trump's entire presidency so personally as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio but they will throw at this present there are no there's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him an\nAngel supporters to all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this evening\nHatred of the Trump voter to oh that's a part of the anti Trump movement they despise voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining weren't good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us\nBecause of all that and that's why they feel\nCompletely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always on the fringe in the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated that\nUh what's happening what's so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories and it is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that he can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemns this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump why didn't Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate and he said this many many times then they'll say well why does Trump talk about white nationalist so much\nYou can't win folks\nYou you know it's there's nothing he can do that will make them\nStop calling him a racist stop calling in\nIf I were speaking to them instead of to you [noise]\nI Would say to them [noise] you are the ones who are out of step with our society\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that is America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for will not stand for your comment the [noise]\nThe greatest president my lifetime\nWith the possible exception of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a that's a tough one too\nTough one to be as a tougher record to compare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way\nBut I play that for you just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThat as our movements and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that's where all stars\nAnd so true anti Semitism\nAndrew racism and I say that with the qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some of the calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a\nPolitical ... true anti Semitism and racism and uh and and and bigotry is not just non conservative eighties anti set a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with an ailing noble rights and if we're not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really as conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person\nOr any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person at that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal worth\nAs human beings and as citizens of this great nation so when the last try so hard to create this perception that\nPeople who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right a meeting all of it I was at its peak the write in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that day 'cause of themselves and the right you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way\nOr they conservative though you know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing and left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and there are about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leave as elites and separate\nFrom the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to beat the other side politically which would be us\nWe are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life\nAnd that has an obligation on all of us\nUm when when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism in these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that because it's\nShow on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nOr it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been\nPropagandize to such that they they really believe and I know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that\nAnd you and I said you knowing that that is a lie it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender\nThey're the ones that want these differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender on these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side the side of conservatives unconstitutional is are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people and\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get so there I said triggered when you just brought up that they are the part of the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how do the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage directed that has been\nThe aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party there's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding in the constitution and the rights of each and every individual and the natural\nLaw that underpins all of this that it's not really just about what the founding fathers said at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths\nAbout human beings what is always true about people what is always good for society to promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn those universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just [noise] it is the exact opposite of a true conservative [noise] to believe the first thing is less than because it's getting to the person is less than as a ... [noise] a less then because of religion [noise] that is not who we are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that and I know that that I Do think\nThat is worth sometimes taking a step back and just\nVerbal ... exactly why that is the [noise]\nThere's a lot of ... and frauds out there and a lot of very easy and clever ways for people that try and falsify their records and who they are that's why if you're hiring or you're renting out your property you want the experts at global verification network to have your back so many people that have used mobile verification heard about\nThem on this show are realizing that they made the right choice because they got the customer service and the expertise that they needed to go over a vacation network is the only dual certified veteran own background investigation and\nVetting something they'll work with companies of any size folk so whether you're just to start off with all the way up to a fortune one hundred if you're doing this yourself\nOr you got an age our department called them they should be the ones doing your background\nCheck eight seven seven six nine five eleven Seventy nine eight seven seven six nine five one one Seventy\nNine my G.

P. R. C. down in Houston every night Mr Jesse Kelly great to have you on\nDrugs to be here buck either do it rather\nUh so I you know I I'm always a little\nFrustrated 'cause I'm not surprise surprise not the right works I Know that after a terrible shooting incident wherever it is there there's always the suggestion of oh why do you bring up armed guards\nAs though that some crazy idea or you know I've\nI've seen plenty of armed guards and or armed police at major religious sites where I grew up in New York City I just don't know Jesse why this gets dismissed by the ... I guess I Do know but it frustrates me that the left just dismiss this out of hand we really do just want to save lives\nThen that's where it gets dismissed for simple reason because it's the truth it's just like the left most dismiss off things that are the truth it is a simple\nObvious solution that would obviously solve the problem and therefore the left is forced to hate it because they have to live in a world of make believe we have armed guards\nEverywhere we truly care about everywhere you truly want to protect a place that's a target or potential target has an armed guard side of it or close by that cold security that's the norm that's the real world\nBut even bringing up an actual solution is just going to get your reactions a horror from the left who they think the only solution to disarming every ...\nI just can't imagine the circumstances where I'm In a place that generally speaking a lot of people do not you know you're you're you're not expecting that Sarah Oh it depends where you are right I I don't know what it was like in the Pittsburgh synagogue I'm guessing probably none of the you know none of the parishioners are ever arms or you know I don't know in other congregations there ever arm\nUh but I Know there are some churches in the south where I was people are All right I mean it it depends on where you are\nBut the the idea that this is automatically a bad idea I think it just goes to show how ideological lot of the reaction to this is because if I'm sitting there and I see somebody who's got a side arm and that's that's either a law abiding gun owners showing their side arm or he's trained security or orbit perhaps off duty law enforcement\nThe last thought that ever goes through my mind is oh well I'm less safe now Jesse I mean this seems very basic\nWell it seems basic to you both because you were CIA if you have comments that you do you acknowledge the way the world really is\nBut I I one thing I have come to grips with is how frightening guns of any kind are for those who have never experienced it never held them never shot one never been taught the basic safety about them it really is a terrifying thing for people who don't know they look at it\nAnd honestly it sounds crazy they think that things just going to start shooting\nI Know I think you make a really good point and you know I Know you're not just the tax in but also were a marine so you've got double firearms familiarity baked in there\nBut you know you you look at at the the cultural differences\nIn the very very blue areas versus a lot of the rest of the country you know when I tell people that I went to a a camp as an eleven year old where we were firing rifles they look at me like I'm nuts I mean they think this is crazy sounding\nBut it just goes to show that part of the political and cultural divide we have now in this country is exactly what you said it's not just that people don't have similarities with guns all that's a big part of it\nThey've also been raised to think or they'd they'd been led to believe by their peers and those around them\nThat guns except in the hands of the states are always a bad thing really I mean that's really the belief and also by the way Jessie the people who aren't part of the state apparatus meaning there aren't police or military who want to have guns or at best suspect and at worst a threat\nShe thinks she's coming back I've been to I'm you know I've been saying all along and you could tell there that\nShe knows she's not supposed to let that out right now she knows she's supposed to hold back a little more it's not supposed to go they're not supposed to be you know it obviously pushing for her own future and the White House at this stage of the game\nBecause she comes from a damaged political brand\nOut but you can't help herself Hillary Clinton\nAs I have said has a hole in her soul the only thing that will fill it in her mind is the ultimate power of the presidency\nAnd there was nothing else that you could ever have or could ever do that would make what she has been through because I'm sure she views yourself as a kind of victim and a and I'm a martyr for the left wing progressive cause politically speaking\nYou know she stood beside bill she allowed so many people to uh bash\nAre all these years I mean I'm saying this is in her in her mind the only thing that is just the only way that justice is done is if she becomes president United States and I I've\nBeen saying it and I just want to make sure that I'm very clear very on the record year what happens is that the Democrats if they take the house marchers right into fights over impeachment that becomes the whole discussion we're just going to be fighting over impeachment really for the next Eighteen months\nAnd then the narrative is that the only way to set right what they could not get because they will not have two thirds of the Senate so they can't remove Hillary but the only way to set it right would be to make Hillary presidents finally to break that\nLA\nAnd finally put her in a position where she gets to be the president of the United states I'm I'm not the only one who's thinking this Hillary yourself you could tell it's\nLike well I mean I'm not saying I'm running I'm just saying that I really want the jobs bill and nobody is more qualified than\nI Am I mean this is the kind of stuff you say when you want something that you know you're not supposed to walk\nAnd or at least you're not supposed to say you want it but that's where we are with us she she has not given up\nOne bit she still thinks that this is the way that it's all going to go and and what a what a a a a crazy story in her mind it's got to be for running against Brock Obama losing run against Trump and losing\nAnd in the end though in her mind justice prevails and she sets right the world and you could tell that she said oh you know there's so much work to do and her\n... her mind set her attitude is alright America you know I'm the one that's got to fix fix the mess that that Trump created\nAnd oh by the way you own this to me you owe me the presidency\nThat hasn't changed one bit and she is very much so in that mindset so I Know it's a little early but keep in mind that next Tuesday or this coming Tuesday went out yeah next Tuesday that's next Tuesday the midterms will be over and the presidential election will begin\nNext Tuesday is when we start to talk about who's really going to run the Democrats are I think about what you're going to have a huge deal\nThe candidates on the Democrats' side I think you're going to have a a massive field of all kinds of people including some real characters I'm not totally convinced that I have a nod he's still thinks that are doesn't still think that he's going to run I'm I'm not convinced\nAs crazy as that may really beat anybody who's living in the real world I Would not be surprised if you did in fact have an ... candidacy I could see I could see that happening and I think that you look at some of the others out there\nElizabeth Warren probably still going to run again focus conscious herself still going to run because she thinks that in the Arab Trump\nAll that matters is that you deliver for your side and no matter how humiliating her whole fake Native American or deal may have been she thinks that she can still deliver\nA socialism for America that's that is what the fights going to be make no mistake about it this is going to be about this election will be about socialism\nThe last election was about the crony corrupt ... Clinton's that was quite alliteration but you know what I mean the last election was about the progressive media elite establishment finally getting getting the upper cut that is so deserved after all these years\nAnd the next election is going to be socialism\nNo doubt in my mind it's going to be open forget about the kind of Bernie Sanders cuddly I just want free school stuff is going to be open a Seventy percent tax rate kind of redistribute the wealth reparations for all kinds of historical wrongs a massive\nGovernment intervention the healthcare markets open borders so that you can dilute whatever pain the productive citizens feel by just drowning out their votes with with new arrivals are that's\nGoing to be with the next elections all about a ... with that in mind by the way that I think of some of these\nSome of these never Trump ... are just getting crazier and crazier you know they they've gone from Russia collusion and now they have to find something else to justify their their hatred and I mean Max Boot I feel weird even talking about it because he's such a weirdo\nAnd show in significant in terms of his influence and his thinking in the in the conservative movement in fact the only ... you have to get us into wars that were or at least in one case very bad idea\nUm but you know he'll just slander Trump with stuff like that\nFox News on that crowd Breitbart and enforcing the Daily Caller Republican congressman there been vilified George Soros for years and basically because George Soros because they're rich through and so when they talk about Soros start talking about\nA rich Jew who's in control of everything or when they talk about global us which is a trend that first right when ... when Trump says Kobus rightwing extremist here germs this is those repugnant dog whistling which has gone assaults and you're right it's not just ... a lot of Republicans it's a lot of folks have Fox News they really everything that he's saying is a vision narrow focus\nMirror by the way everything people don't refer to anti Semitism when there's criticism of Sheldon Adelson who is a very wealthy Jewish Republican donor\nThat's apparently not anti Semitic this notion that global is some kind of dog was a global is is a term that's been used in international relations are for decades and has nothing to do with someone being Jewish ... Jimmy Carter\nA global is I mean there there are lots of people that you could look at him referred you historically that work for you then as global nothing to do with Judaism or certainly with anti Semitism um but booth realizes\nThat if you're going to go to the other team but not enough to just say I don't like Trump you have to say I despised Trump I hate Trump I'll do anything I'll say anything I Will bend the knee and beg forgiveness from a left and be a turn coat and slander all my former friends and allies\nI don't know how these people sleep at night\nI Can't imagine turning on all the people that I respect and work with no now and am ideologically in line with and later just turn around because it was convenient for me and\nCall them own pace [noise] what a creature this ... [noise]\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home titled fraud where the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title walk found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your whole had it been real this is the foot of taking out loans using books home is equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments ... showed up in that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud look if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day home title luck puts a virtual barrier around your homes title\nThe instant they detect sinister activity there on it helping to shut it down their hopes titled may already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free titles scared and report\nAs a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title locked dot com\nHarsher penalty possible blindly sell the camera Fox News the sounds in Saturday's mass shooting at Pittsburgh synagogue makes his initial court appearance as the nation's top prosecutors as Robert Bauer may pay the ultimate right\nI don't really fair enough I just am I going to grab one of us know something about sports 'cause I I remember when I when I heard that before the show when I heard that somebody was like I'm not that might explain this one has ... Mickey Mickey and Joe\nI think that they've decided that their brand is that they're going to be the most shrill anti Trump lunatics on TV and that's a very crowded space right now is you know that's not an easy thing to be number one it\nSo and the drama they bring to the table I mean they ... a month I mean imagine if you look so miserable they've noticed that when they're on air how happy they look yeah well you know generally like to go through life bucking sorry\nGenerally being double home Rutgers is a bad start to things\nI'm just putting there you go there you go just putting that out I Know I Know I Try not to go to personal but you know that's not good that's not a good thing that I'm not\nA what's the word bad karma yes bad karma speaking of um I have no good\nTransition here but you know see because I was like wait NBC CBS they're both networks of them that they're both full lives but CBS had this uh this segment about\nHate speech in taking down hate speech and\nHas been one of the issues that has you know I've been talking about for a long time here\nWhere we you know you have this chorus particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line um and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use this to shut down conservatives ... shock\nNo one out but that's what ends up that's what ends up happening a time and again and so they they they can't get the true anti Semite soft line that can't get ISIS and these other groups are to be\nTaken out of their their the cyberspace but they would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts deactivated but here's part of this\nA discussion and I have a slightly different view of this in terms of what the actions of these platforms should be ...\nRadicalized online has already been supported by our government that we believe that after nine eleven when people had access to ISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize yet isolated individuals we know\nNow that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that have worked with the government to take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremism it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context in a particular case of Bowers yeah ... it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general\nPrinciple it's a very difficult to identify what if a speech what is not hate speech and the ... farm policies on that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be a situation where conservatives are the\nOnes who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're in force against the left at all and ... and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that\nLouis Farrakhan still has lots of social\nMedia are still is able to view his hatred and tolerance and this is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's effort over the weekend to try and create this narrative of right wing extremism is responsible for all or almost all of the anti Semitism in this country when that's just not the case not the case at all and you\nKnow here are the kinds of things that Farrah Khan who\nYou know gets deposed in photos with rock Obama when he's running for the president's ... remember that oh that's right journalist hid that in the public because they didn't want us to see what was really going on there\nAre but Farrah Khan is still treated as somebody by the media who should have and does have a voice he's not the platform he's not pushed off of all the different social media outlets\nBut here's the kind of stuff that minister Farrakhan says play fourteen and one to\nWhere you recognize say\nAnd one where you see the same panic Jew\nAnd the synagogue of Satan which had many races in it\nBecause they need to see the whole world\nThink about what they're going to say\nWhen they have been so\nAnd come clean\nOn mass\nWhenever you read that God\nHas told the Jews to hear an old bay\nAnd they say I hear and I get old bay\nLouis disobeying God\n\nPretty gross pretty clearly anti Semitic the state panic Jew Farrah Khan says\nAnd he's still somebody that prominent Democrats can hang out with an public can can speak with whether it's commentators were politicians are you'll notice that you don't have Democrat presidential contenders\nAsked the way that the way the Republicans were asked about David Duke loser that nobody cares about nobody you know gives a you know what to hear from all Republicans have to be asked in every presidential cycle will do do do do do do you just about David ... why is it ever Democrats you disavow do you just about Louis Farrakhan\nWhy wasn't Brock Obama asked do you disavow Louis Farrakhan why wasn't Hillary Clinton ask do you just about\nCirca\nOh that's right you mean the media is dishonest and their activists and there are so sensitive about an

so I'm just saying that they they look to penalize people I mean there's a an aggressive attitude about gun owners that some law enforcement agencies and I think ATF has very high on that list\nThat someone force when agencies or adopt in a way that is I think that puts them attention with the constitution and and is really problematic but anyway but with the hog and these others about the ... it
