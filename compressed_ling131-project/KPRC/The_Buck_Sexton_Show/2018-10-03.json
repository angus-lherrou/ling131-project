I can tell you having watched the interview shoes and she's a liar because she changed her statement from what the official statement was you don't get to go from oh I I was one declaration saying that Brett Kavanaugh spiked punch at a party and then say well he was standing next to the punch in might have spiked it\n\nI don't know if any of you saw or how many of you saw the Jewish wedding interviews aired on NBC NBC which also we may get to later has\nVarious versions of an untrue story trying to say that Kavanaugh was causing problems about the Ramirez testimony is the second woman didn't testify just give us warns Dame but the remembers allegation\nBut hold that thought for a moment sweat Nick\nIs the one who says the Kavanaugh was president for gang rapes and there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweat it also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's\nI don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford may be a mistake and I think she's a very troubled woman\nI think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may which she makes clear by telling us She's got as you should just happens to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think she has issues completely apart from Kevin ... but she may very well believe what she said and as I've told you hear\nI Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people going to prison I Would it's testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is\nTo be ... and ... might be making a mistake that's destroying someone's life here's just a\nPart of the kinds of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate what was the third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady story and say you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all of these leftist females who are coming forward at a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons or we're we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that conversation\nIt's a man's life his reputation his honor his dignity hand in the balance hang in the balance and day a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well here's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nPut his hand well I'll tell what happened when it happened to me I don't put ten and Cather\nThat Ali said boy far outside his room congregated together sort of like an outlet\nAnd I didn't know what was that ... ... ... a lot of laughing I'm falling in line outside or wind definitely huddled by door I didn't understand what it could possibly ...\nAnyone to get their way they're watching out in our\nIn our whole informed outside the door\nThing that I Would say from ... to have [noise] I Would say [noise]\nI I it's just too coincidental\nSo I think we had something pop in the audio that we we've got we've crossed wires there for a second but you heard sweat next talking let's not look at what she says that are trying to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because she was just a liar I I can tell you what she's lying about\nShe's saying that she thinks that there were gang raped her she's making the allegation that there were gang rapes going all these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms\nAs she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together has she ever been to a party were teenagers are you do have a drink seven fondue whatever they're doing they clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere was nothing about what she says it makes it as a game of she claims that she was raped in ... I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she thinks raped her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nDoesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she claimed that she was drugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete an author I Know this is a fabrication now\nDoes she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense she went from saying in this interview\nThat Kavanaugh's spike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of lemons but that means everybody's getting drunk or high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking this up you know is adding a little adding a little a boost to it to make a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking punch so they can do that he can't roof the the big bowl of punch because that means you'd be roofing himself and all the other guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you have to drink from that you as a bad idea ... story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication though that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated it's you can't keep it straight she claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they don't I went to a a cat\nThe school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone and we drink beer and\nNot really kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and she added that detail to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from her sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that brick capital maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of capital she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens but people in college don't go to the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with that my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls are being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThe call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here right a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWould be in a much stronger position to take action\nOr would futile much stronger position socially when they're part of you know Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought you know I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with them is just on the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nIn an interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\nBecause you can't J.

I Know they're talking to mark judge now the FBI is going to go interview mark judge marketing telling exactly what he's already written down on just one statement\nI don't know this woman I don't know what you're talking about this didn't happen cabinet never did this she's like basically that's what you're going to say about Ford maybe afford Ramirez\nAnd sweat Nick ... is the one who says that maybe maybe he\nKavanaugh exposed himself during college she can't be sure but she called a lot of people to ask them what they think\nThat's not that's not something that\nInspires confidence in her telling of a vent it\nCan't be sure exactly but you know it might have been him so let's try to pile on and help ruined his life that's where mirrors\nAnd then they find some roommate or doesn't like look you could find people in college I didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them\nYou know they probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever to trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college is they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you were conservative everybody loves to bash among conservatives\nOh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties\nReally does but I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so then it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think Collins realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression and that's my analysis I could be wrong Murkowski though strikes me is more transactional\nRent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for her forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concerns and then you also have this is continuing narrative and its ties into\nWhat I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch reflect you see they can't get cabin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the capitals of all the gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence running this because there is no evidence\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there is the approach that she has which is just whatever we can do to\nCriticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight you live the Donald with that at all and Rick cabin all through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need and had the island nation because there are a lot of allegations\nThe end for its really are about how he behaves is drunk\nSo that is very relevant and the trail\nOf himself as actively choir boy or is there much contradicted by his cellphone may sampling college and some people who knew him and I go why we need an FBI investigation like calling front line for like five months\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that senator who wrote it was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\n\nWe need an FBI investigation of capital because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator or she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being harsh honor\nTotal a missile total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament and the lines of the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you you got people that hate Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and it was a ... and his conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitutional is and also I Believe the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four or whatever it was no that's not serious New York times doing a peace right now\nOn how he was part of a like party planning or something back in the day and in New York Times doing that base whoa oh gosh and he was a college kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and\nHis social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also had Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights I'm sure to\nOf course\nThat's that's that's a given you can assume that book by creating the storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's a belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flick and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to let's put forward we agree both lakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today and say I guarantee you I Would vote for Kevin office has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open this story line you see how it goes all we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented partners in assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale costumes and putting anatomically correct female body parts on their heads as hats and all the stuff that they're doing all that\nFlake takes the position of\nOh well we should have now and give them what they want in the spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yes you'll receive a lot of\nViciousness from Washington viciousness a lot of anger it's not vicious it's completely warranted legitimate justice really from people but\nHe's playing the long game of I Want to get a book a book deal from Simon and Schuster or whomever you know a big big big publishing house\nThat's that's what flakes game last year or so that's why I'm I'm concerned I don't know how the votes\nWill go I'm not I have\nZero confidence in their ability of Republicans in this case to do what's right one thing that just that just got released and I I wasn't sure I I'm not going to read to you from it\nBecause it is salacious\nThat you could definitely say it is it is a salacious document sort of like the salacious da da da da da ... noticed this I I Am aware of it\nAnd\nIt's the Senate Judiciary committee they released a statement from somebody that I think kind of romantic linked to sweat Nick and man oh man or their things in there essentially telling you the sweat Nick is a very disturbed and sexually\nI don't even know what the word would be you have to read the document I Can't read it on their family show there's some really intense stuff in there though bottom line is the woman is crazy that's\nThat's the bottom line uh and that her allegations should not be taken seriously and and you know they they they posted up some activists in Reagan Airport I see this and and they're trying to harass other Republican senators in there now and I heard this line you know how many women have to be assaulted before you believe women\nThis is a this is a fundamental problem with the whole left wing approach you're a collective version of justice or a collective is the approach to justice that's at the heart of all I Want to address that when we come back and then we'll talk about the\nMid

to\nThe list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the center out in the ... not in the house\nRepublican wave ... isn't that interesting\nPublic and wave is it possible folks that just as we saw on twenty sixteen\nThe GOP in the era of Trump could greatly defied the experts in the expectations in this upcoming election I don't want to get your hopes up and I I kinda want everybody listening to this to be fired up and be mad\nMad people people who are or annoyed about what's going on there like we are to show up and vote people that are happy to get a little complacent you know what the status quo they figure out things are good things will stay good well\nWhat are you seeing in the cabinet debacle is that Democrats cannot be trusted with power you can't have these people in charge you can't do it\nHave to stop them\nFrom being able to set the government agenda will be a bad thing for all of us so I don't want anyone to lose sight of that but the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that it\nCould go either way and we're over a month out\nFrom election day right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day Senate and this is wherever and start saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics Bob ... ... it all comes down to turn out you know\nLobby blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundits is not telling the same thing as people keep asking me I I don't I mean I\nCertainly hope to Republicans win but and you know what they're probably gonna do it it's not like I think the world's going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and\nWay of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for all of us right but at the end of the day it doesn't determine who you are what your value is you know this is a problem with the Democrats love the show personally wrapped up in\nHer party and all that stuff I mean I I'm wrapped up in principles of their ideas that really matter to me\nAh you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm giving a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me I think the GOP is doing a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job ... not not\nBeyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening that that's one point I wanted to make your in in terms of\nWe've seen with Kavanaugh I I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSo you see the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact if it doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said and that means preventing Democrats from taking the house\nDemocrats take the house it's going to turn into one long\nEndless investigation and impeachment fight that's the only thing that's going to be out there that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no one no policy agenda\nThey are going to agree on we'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs\nHopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't\nHave that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats that women will turn out in huge numbers of cabinet gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe that Kavanaugh is a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it hated Kavanaugh anyway it's like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and that'll decide well you decided before\nAny this even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find Sunday we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all ... Democrats as forget about the due process for the allegations of sexual impropriety they made a complete mess of the\nNormal Amish Senate hearings right they they made it ridiculous just to sit down and the Senate and asked this guy some questions he had all these crazy protesters and all sorts of man\nAnd if you're the same way try eagle energy simple fixed rate no gimmicks no surprises on your bill great customer service over Ninety percent retention for a reason eight seven seven Ninety three eagle eight seven seven Ninety three eagle P.

the radio original vision of vinyl experience [noise]\n\n[noise]\nEspecially if you're a what the person is doing is the more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do because that's what they're gonna do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff like to do the easiest thing for him to do would be just to vote\nFor a cap and on and get them out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with it that was a gutsy thing to do when it 'cause it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nIs the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThe Stephen Colbert show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThe reason he did not was that he could not take the heat\nThat's not courage that is actually the opposite of Kurds that is called cowardice but notice how this spring and\nThey're trying to you and this is very all top are very establishment news media they want all the little senators that are still in the mix they want everybody who is perhaps persuadable on this one when you get to the final vote process\nThey want everyone to know that you know the ones who wants to stop this process or the brave ones let me tell you what Jeff lakes calculation was Jeff Flake really really wants to be liked\nBy CNN by the New York times it's adoptive these are powerful cultural institutions and especially if you're no longer going to be a politician you want in your day to day life to be thought of well by people who have large megaphones who have cultural influence and also by the way\nCan pay you a whole lot of money to do a whole lot of different things that's what you want\nThat's what the self interested person is going to be concerned with first and foremost\nLike didn't show courage not the harder thing to do he knows this is a scam he's not a complete moron and he knows\nThat if he were to have gone along and do the right thing she would be in tremendous hot water right now with the laugh with the media so what did he do try to create an alibi for himself\nI'm Still not convinced that he will vote for Kavanaugh but I Would note that even if he does vote for Kavanaugh flake thinks that he's going to be the Republican in this process who when he wants to give fancy speeches in Aspen\nOr East Hampton or wherever when he wants to be among the lead again and treated like somebody that they can stand from the right you know that they can kind of accept him he will say oh well I was the one that got the one week extension I was the one that made sure that there was this\nBeyond that investigation which as we now she is a sham it was always going to be a sham it's lake knew it was a ... so what did you why did he do it self interest which is the opposite of courage\nCowards because he felt like he had been cornered by those women including a straw roast funded active if you can't even make this stuff up\nYelled at him and so he decided to make a different call that day and what he had already said in the morning same day\nLike is a self interested coward in this whole process and that won't change even if you vote for cabin on the yet because what he's doing is just created additional risk for a man in this case judge Kavanaugh who has been ambushed who has been smeared who has been wind\nIf you're a person of honor and integrity you don't allow that to continue when it's in your power to stop it that's what Jake Tapper doesn't understand apparently it's with Jake Tapper does know yeah there was a hard thing for me do it was a hard thing for him to do for the few days but he'll get criticism from the right\nIt's much easier thing for him to do for the rest of his life when he's going to want to be at the country club or he's going to be able to go and get a contributor ship it MSNBC or CNN or ABC and he'll say I'm the Republican who broke ranks in order to try and\nDefend uh
