and stealing and he's he's got he's got a long long wrap sheet\nSo the threat based on everything we know it was completely gone there is nothing there's nothing to suggest that this guy had any one assisting him there's any cell or cluster hear anyone else that his operation on his behalf this was a lone crazy in a van\nThe van which you may very well have seen already\nA van is\nCovered in pro Trump and pro pens paraphernalia and CNN sucks and other anti a mainstream media stuff he clearly was very attuned to the rhetoric\nOf the right done particularly of Donald Trump himself in a way that is being seized on\n'em now look ... we we left open the possibility all week\nThat there would be a few different ways that this could go right that there would be a few different possibilities for motive here\nOr we discussed that it could be a crazy we discussed that it could be a yes it could have been a false flag operation but there was no evidence to support anything other than bombs are being sent it was a very dangerous situation needed to be\nA fixed dealt with as soon as possible what's also just take them home and just say the law enforcement did an incredible job here\nAnd they should be commended for working under tremendous pressure and doing show or with the entire country watching in a very much\nPaying attention to every move here if I were a little more from attorney

injured in this so thank God\nUm but this is now an entirely political discussion that's where this goes there's not a security and law enforcement was on the ball got this guy tracked him down everything that we thought would happen with this happened this has really textbook from an investigative standpoint\nNow this is the food fight that we've all known was already happening but now it's going to get even worse about how this is Trump's all they want to say that this is Trump's fault doesn't matter that\nWe didn't blame the laugh we didn't blame Bernie Sanders himself for the James Hodgkinson shooting them at baseball diamond doesn't matter that\nEach a fallacy to assume that somebody who says something that is not calling for inspiring violence can be blamed for the violent acts of another person who happens to agree\nWith a public persona a politician any number of different things um this is on tenable\nWe can't actually be forced to take responsibility for actions that other people do not based on what we tell them to do but based on the fact that they have their own demons their own problems\nAnd they are crazy but be prepared for\nAn avalanche sheer of media coverage and commentary particularly commentary\nAbout how Trump needs to change his town Trump has to stop calling the media fake news yet to stop he has to stop doing everything that that they don't like this now is the secret weapon that they have to get Trump to shut up and I'm here to tell you that would be a huge mistake\nDoes not Trump's fault it's just not your fault that is not my fault we take no responsibility for this because we bear no responsibility for this\nWe share ideas we fight for the truth and we will not\nBe forced into a mic position in our politics in our principles

head of the hate parade [noise]\nLeave dogs of ice cream of the\nRhetoric that comes out of that White House [noise] not helpful at all [noise]\nUm they're collateral damage\nTone and coming from the top and now than it has become a target\nNow in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that made it almost habitable that top Democrats and the media when he targeted\nThis day there is no connection between what Trump has said about Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Eric Holder and John Brennan and CNN and the thinking of the person who sent those pipe bombs is foolhardy this is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list\nNotice are we switch there and that little montage replayed it starts off with very prominent famous anti Trump Democrats saying all manner of you\nKnow nasty Vineland gag rich story is that a word I think it's a word degrading I think I think I might have just made up the egg rich or is that ... did I just make up a word or derogatory degree tore\nOh yeah yeah I did\nI just made up a word um yeah I just made up a word\nOf live radio that's interesting you know we'll go with it derogatory was what I was looking [laughter] but but ... story sounds doesn't cut it sounded like a word I kind of made up my word there for a second or folks been a long way\n[laughter] you go but I you know that's when you know you're a real baller like Bush when when Bush said Mr underestimated I knew exactly what he meant you know and that's no word when he called himself the decider\nThat wasn't technically a word either but it might as well up in a word and now it is where I think it's great you know who's the designer was the old who's the person who makes the decisions I don't know the decider\nUh anyway so I made up or they're let's get back to the substance or so they they are all saying these things about Trump very nasty things very um surrogate story things and then they all immediately jumped to its Trump's fault is Trump's fault but there's clearly\nDisturbed very yes dangerous and and and evil but she added pathetic human being a decided to send these these homemade they were pipe bombs and they were they\nWere alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but there's really no principle that the left is using your determine\nYou know what is acceptable what is acceptable political speech and what does incitement it's just what is your side do that's bad but it's my side do that's okay and that's really the primary separation\nThere's really not a lot to separate things beyond that there's not much that you can point you were you'd say you know oh I see that there is some establishment of an actual baseline\nOf of how we can adjudicate these things no no no it's just my side good your side bad and we knew this was going to happen\nOr it's just it's just very it's frustrating to see this um because it is so it is so obvious it is so clear\nOh Governor Cuomo also wants to where are you on the bombs let me first start that a bomb is a combustible devised with explosive material yo that can be dangerous place Thirteen\nPolitical mania this fervor rancor hatred or you'll see this again and again and again thank\nHome title luck puts a virtual barrier around your homes title the instant

in different ways I think the president of the United states ... percent dog whistles to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over there and\n... hour let's say the way the president wants them to do it as oh way really does do a lot to promote violence now they're trying to turn it on\nA would they would like to intimidate us and of course they must be a wisely must be foolish and how can a pony ways but\nWe never stopped to end up by the justice from ... in this country Maxine Waters very foolish\nAnd you know we we just gave you there on the\nOne hand she's calling for centrally rabble rousing she wants people to get up in faces she wants to you know yell and scream and be nasty and mean and you know don't don't give them a moment's peace and then she's you know saying that\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems and this\nIs why I I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now are we know that this guy is a wacko\nIs going to be the right is going to\nThese saddled with this with this complete you know look he's he's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to you know they need to be serious consequences for this well you really under the disguise also I mean is it there's something sad about\nSomeone who is show so deranged empathetic and an evil and\nJust the whole thing I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative of a broader sentiment on the right meanwhile you know we have a country of three hundred and twenty million people\nAnd now I can think of er there's one there's one person that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who since Trump has been president\nPeople would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his uh what he views as his politics um but\nNow that they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go way they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties and things like Nineteen Ninety three you'll still hear about\nBombing abortion clinics hasn't happened and you know a very long time but that's\nAnytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and I wanted to discuss this with the young Turks guy who was on my show and rising morning with junk we're now we're going to hear again you watch next week\nThere'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with and I always have to point out well\nThe big issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it ah that's first and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things and how do you really count this\nWhat is the determining factor whether something is kind of his terrorism because with some of the federal statistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know a neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ...\nWell if the guy was a minority of those ... now is that a hate crime is murder yes is it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit\nAh a little bit less ... less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism or and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nAnd from the statistics forwarded attacks I mean the moment that you start looking at worded attacks then you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat that we\nYou know you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them a column I mean these are attacks would it kill hundreds of people\nMost of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most the right when jurors may site is single acts of violence against individuals by\nA neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again heinous\nEvil or crimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not strategic level\nNational threat terrorism the way the radical Islamic terrorism is but I'm just telling you you're going to now that we've got this guy who's been captured today\nThis this uh says our fellow says are uh say rock whatsoever keep forgetting is how ... last name and everyone remembers his first name but not not studied everyone's saying uh everyone's saying that\nYou know he's obviously so pro Trump ... such a bad guy said or say ... say opposites Iraq say or\nWhat is a we know what it is\nI mean his ... I mean is American but what what's his his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any bees his first name says are the kind of unusual anyway [noise] ah\nYeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this is not going away anytime soon it's a unfortunately going to be used against us and I don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that it doesn't I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but\n... you're gonna see floods ... zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid week and change\nBecause they want this to be first and foremost on the minds of as many voters as possible and and they're going to be they're going to be really pushing this and they really want people to think that this is this is what will need to be on the lookout for the real concern is right wing terrorism when there's going to be crazy people of all kinds from all places but [noise] they're [noise]\nHere's a tweet from President Trump quote Twitter has removed many people from my count and more importantly\nThey've done something that makes it much harder to join the of stifles gross to a point where it is obvious to all a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship now it is a blend total bias that's from\nThe leader of the free world my friends who has an enormous Porter falling but he knows if something's up if you don't trust these social media giants to do right by you any more there are other places to go sniffy dot com is a new social media site\nThat has none of the bias none of the left leaning agenda nonsense that is going to be shadow banning people kicking you off the platform for deciding what you can say in what get seen as an I. P. P. Y. dot com I just posted yesterday you can just get into the conversation whenever you want\nFree to join free to post a new social media site with no agenda and no bias all about your thoughts and ideas sniffy dot com\nHoming through evidence signed ... Fox News the FBI examining a van converting anti Democrat and pro Trump stickers belonging to mail bomb since they saved our than he was arrested this morning for the series and attempted bombing targeting high profile Democrats and other\nAnd don't want to give it to other people and use the government and the power that they have other indoor outside of government in order to make sure that they keep the stuff that they have stuff and that other people don't ah that sounds very that has a Marxist twang right that sounds like it's\nVery much about the redistribution of wealth\nAnd I think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself he's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful\nThat's where he knows that's a sweet spot for Democrats and the and the push that push that notion it's it's powerful politics\nAnd accused the other side of being cynical ... what is it that Republicans Republicans want to give a little less of their own money to the government there being greedy\n... this is a a at a central talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires\nOkay well they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I mean are the top one percent pays I think thirty percent\nOf all federal income taxes so there we already have a very progressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to wherever it is wherever it is every speech she gives same basic theme\nThere are the other guys don't want the government to have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more stuff\nHe creates this perception that prosperity and security and all these things that people strive for society that the zero some one side has at the other side doesn't\nMean what what what are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is you know what why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrity good on the list these are people that have amassed incredible fortune\nAll Democrats why are they all Democrats\nYou know what what I find to be the case is that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle to make their money uh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative people that when the genetics\nLottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people or people who get really really lucky with you know signing onto a start up early on in Silicon valley you know being with the temp guy in the door and now their options are worth a billion dollars and\nThey tend to be liberal I you know this is just that anecdotal but that's my sense of it if you had to sweat it out risk many night's sleep or you know do your own taxes take out your own trash\nA cut back on on you know eating out because you're trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nOr concerns\nI just that's the only way I could explain the difference in the economic philosophy here are but Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful and the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also kept talking about the economy play that play Seventeen\nWe're\nPeriod and Republicans had been cutting\nFor the rich [noise] they've been cutting holes\n[noise] and we\nFinancial crisis in our life [noise] and Democrats [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhy did it start with Obama how how about we've\nHad even we had an even bigger financial pulled back with the great depression and we recovered from that and ... and enter period of huge\nEconomic growth and a boom I mean Obama really at what point\nDoes he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years in the Trump presidency we're still hearing about how Obama ... remind her by the way Obama never achieved or three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never only president in history\nFor whom that's the case so when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous that what he's saying is is transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government was the problem with what happened in the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this\nYou know when he says the Greek banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was that liberals said that banks to lend to people who can't pay it back but if you can't pay it back and you happen to be\nNon privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories then banks have to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a loan and you\nDo that enough and the federal government backstop those loans and says well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we've we've got you got you covered Wall Street\nAnd Wall Street does what it does that's what really happened I mean you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather by someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy what exactly does does he think got and it was just\nGot to go to call them to go go go gotta going how ... what exactly did he do\nAnd I think the truth is it's very clear he he has absolutely no answer that I mean the stimulus was was atrocious as soon as was a huge waste of money and that was money that\nWas put on the tab for future generations to pay so what do you know ... what did Obama bring to the table when it came to get an economy of running answers he doesn't even have an answer\nHe's just out there just all demagoguery it's all so shallow but really that's a good summary of what we have for eight years of Obama\nTo all the business owners age are folks anyone who's hiring anybody across the country you got to make sure that the person who is doing or

that's right free speech\nIs no longer inclusive of saying stuff about\nThe prophet Mohammed and others so have you get mad at me when I said the prophet Mohammed I'm not saying he's my profit but we need some way to\nDesignate who this guy is because you may be a very aware of this back a lot of Mohammed running around I don't think it's not just say Mohammed you know maybe you could figure it out of context but people say the prophet Mohammed because\nYou know then we all know we are talking about but it's now a knock considered free speech to say anything mean about the prophet Mohammed and\nYou know you can say oh buck but that Europe why does that really matter keep in mind that one of the big arguments that we constantly hear now in this country is that what they're doing in Europe we should replicate here when it comes to economics when it comes specifically to health care\nOh it works in Europe we should do it here Canada has also gone down this fast\nCanada's no longer a country where you can a reliably speak on issues that deal with Islamic radical Islam and radicalism and\nThey also have the and then never mind also the gender ... you know male female issue\nWhich is really large professor Peterson's career by the way was that he was one who said I like I'm not going to play this game of calling people the as a function of law that just strikes me as as as bizarre and and he was right it was bizarre but here you have the European Court of human rights by the way this is the\nUm this is that the case that got this um uh some attention\nQuote the European Court of human rights rule Austrian courts had carefully balance or or the writer freedom of an Austrian woman who called Mohammed a pedophile due to his marriage to a six year old girl\nOr the woman in her late forties and identified only as E S claim during two public sentiment seminars in two thousand other moms marriage to a young girl was quote I can do pedophilia\nAccording to Islamic tradition the marriage between Mohammed and a six year old girl was consummate when she was nine and he was about fifty\nShow here we have a faith tradition that his practice by one point seven billion people and the founder of this face a profit who\nFor believers and I'm not one so I Do not believe this obviously before believers\nAre was dictated by the angel Gabriel or a or a new holy book that really is meant to overtake all the previous holy books um but it's also accepted\nThat he had a a a relationship a sexual relationship with when he was fifty when he was a middle aged man with a child\nThat that's just I mean I that's just to save the facts and this woman was convicted for saying this she was convicted of disparaging\nReligious doctrines had to pay five hundred and forty seven dollar fine so this has now been upheld or the European Court of human rights says that this is the serves the legitimate aim of quote preserving religious piece\nLet me have a few words\nTo say about this\nUm okay if we see this ground\nThat we are no longer allowed to say things that are offensive to people especially offensive to people who are special protected class because of their religion their skin color of their ethnicity their nationality if we see that ground or we will increasingly find that that is just the beginning\nOf much a much\nMore widespread speech restrictions and we used to understand this we used to understand this as a country I think increasingly we are\nNot just losing sight of it but also being force fed the opposite there's a canary in the coal mine affects your with the EU and with Canada and with free speech\nWe should pay very close attention to it\nBy for profit model for ... for a for profit off of our\nArms in Hong Kong or proper power provide fought in front of\nHer for like on my car reporter for less than five years ago [noise]\n\nAnd that was you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise]\nI got to say\nI thought this was a fantastic story in that it lets me do one of my favorite things which is\nBeat up on millennials which everyone in the media does including people like me who are technically millennials are you know this is where you make the hack need avocado toast joke a this is where you get to talk about safe spaces and pajama boy and all that stuff\nOr this was in a this was in the daily wire\nWas earlier this week\nThat there is is it is a study from San Francisco State University that claims at twenty five percent\nOf all millennials are suffering from get ready for it\nShe GST now\nDSD is incredibly serious obviously the DSD is something that if you have for real reasons is uh\nA deserving of the most serious treatment and and assistance and helping and sympathy\nBut they got the DSD because of the election that's right they are so psychologically traumatized because Trump won the twenty sixteen election that they are now considering themselves to be\nOfficially a officially suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome Jew a clinically significant level a clinically sniffing level so you know this this is what I Would say\nGoes into the pile of evidence that I'm building up\nAnd maybe we'll have to do a book or a product on this about how the left really has lost his mind I don't mean that as in oh I'm I'm trying to be funny about them or I'm I'm doing the usual thing that people do on radio or uh in in political media which is you know you exaggerate to get attention no no I I mean that\nThese you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for as an adult at least\nAnd for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up realizing that you don't really want to eat candy all the time you know you don't really want to be in a position where you're just\nConstantly ... on racist pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces you will find yourself\nAt some point do have eaten all the ... you know ... the most uh most popular candy in the world that's right I mean that's number one\nAs a random aside I almost\nA started working when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I got a job\nOffer at a forget which I don't remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy I'm pretty sure it was the Mars account which is a ... so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you need all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reached this level where you're like I've I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore\nAnd that so you learn that as a kid and it but then as an adult as a guy you know you you get to be a rather than women tend to dress some women somewhere that a lot of your like buck I dress like a\nUm I dress like a witch and not a naughty which put a scary one or whatever that's that's cool but some college age and and ... and older you are young women tend to dress in\nMore provocative fashion so bends August worried about this it also is a reminder for me to cultural appropriation which has gotten all this attention right now or the or the holiday season\nCultural appropriation is not a thing or it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to any one or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are John ... a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state\nOf appropriation and evolution\nAnd the only way the culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural as most is like that for a lot of fun fun word there\nThat everybody else is engaged it as well but now I also remember some of my\nMy best and worst costumes over the years John do you ever do you have a a costume and you're either very embarrassed about are very proud of\nThere'll be showing don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAs an adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I don't see how it is I see your call me out now I see what's out there is producer Mike is he going to be talking to or not he nursed right now are sea within earshot of the microphone I think he's talking to an already secretary over somewhere that that sounds that\nSounds about right or you know every every time I think that we could get we can catch Mike on the Mike is he's out getting phone numbers um but I and I can tell you my best costume ever was actually when I was a young adults in my early twenties in DC I found a theater supply store so I got invited to a big fancy Halloween party\nAnd I I uh theater supply store and they let me rents because you want to get really high in costume and not spend a lot of money you got to rent it\nAnd I rented a full on theatrical production costume slash kind of you know uniform replica of general Douglas MacArthur I mean with like the ... and a pipe\nAnd the sunglasses and the whole thing man that costume was legit by the way pen saloons be surprised how much attention to the ladies gave to a guy walks around wearing\nWearing the ... so that was a very good costume I dressed up as Bjorn Borg one year or with a kind of a you know the\nSeventies style tennis out fix I just basically shrank a a shirt and a lot in the in the drier by accident and I had a head band then enter wouldn't tennis racket so that worked out\nSo I don't I don't have any fantastic costumes I'm not somebody who is is quite as up on on their costume game as many others but I Hope if you do go out this weekend appropriate all the culture you want and if you want to or not it costs you guys or girls ... ladies and gentlemen by all means that is that is you're right because darn it\nThis is America um but obviously you know be safe don't don't eat too much candy corn and don't drink too much\nSpiked a trauma candy corn pumpkin juice do ... candy corn rocks or cheat as you're eating it you know they say it's not like you know Mike finally appears some ask somebody what ... what is your what is your best or worst or both Halloween costume and you can remember\nI was never a huge Halloween guy I mean I can I ask the loved it but other than I thought I didn't get too much into it but one year it was actually a watch my buddies and friend did a group thing and we did\nThe ah Addams family and uh I was a mess Adams I'm\nAnd that was fun actually 'cause there was like seven or eight of us and at the individually people were like ... who are you like what are you doing and then but then when he got altogether I Would like you guys are awesome\nSo that was that sort of\nNice wrote an Halloween parties\n... I Know I'm more\nFair enough you know\nAnd I will eat candy and I will give out the candy but er what is the best Halloween candy [noise] good question\nI mean I I'm a I have a huge sweet too\nSo I don't ... I go reasons pieces for me like if I'm if I'm able to just pick any candy I think we just pieces is yeah it was pretty spectacular I'm\nConsidered I'm a we actually got into this conversation the off the other day I mean I'd like to freeze for my candy and I think when you go frozen the Milky Way it doesn't get a whole lot better than that in my opinion\nYeah\nI I had not though I Do know that ... those listening\nIf you ever like make brownies and you don't want to eat them all at once and you keep it in the freezer and then you want to put them in the microwave\nThe your domain chain freshness baked goods frozen is actually a very smart thing to do yeah I didn't learn until like a couple of years ago and apparently they didn't they didn't teach us that the CIA school\n[laughter] so ah anyway All right yeah good good good times producer my concerns were going to come back we got a buddy Benny Johnson in the mix and then we've got a Stephanie\nHamel cut up like a double dose of the Daily Caller just brought it on the show\nAnd you know before actually did a a sit down I did the federalist radio hour which the pot yesterday with Mollie Hemingway who's just just so cool she's great so good on on Fox so a lot of content that I oh by the way it will be on a brief show tonight at eleven pm eastern\nSo talking about all the stuff bringing all the truth but while so [noise]\nAnd uh I'll be back in just a little [noise] the\nFBI calls home titled fact one of the fastest growing crimes my French British yourselves if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for what a feat steals your homes title everything's online these days including your home settled domestic and international thieves\nYeah and I think that uh people are starting to have second thoughts about whether or not he should run for president that strikes me as not the best move\nUh no not the best movie you've happy my question was that in the end of the\nMajor cheerleader from an ID or you have people at CNN or making sure that ah his name is starting to move down and the DNC a presidential candidate less uh he is a Christian was said maybe it's time for us to rethink like an ice as the DNC front let her\n\nKnow I I got also got to have you been ... Halloween Halloween is a holiday that some of us think of as um you know for kids where do you come down on this issue\nOr it's not a whole new for kids\nIs it a holiday for kids should adults dress up I'm going to be getting into a whole sexy costume conversation coming up in a few minutes and then you know where you come down on this issue should adults we dressing up for Halloween\n[laughter] uh well I mean yes there's been major issues in the new fight we problematic ... students I think Megan Kelly had a ... this week about a essentially defending\nIt must be defending black me I don't want to do but she just doesn't have a job anymore she has six nine million dollars in her bank account oh that's great for me my guess is to be fired by NBC and to get Seventy million dollars or so um but yeah\nI I don't I don't remember the problem I'm dressed up as Brett Kavanaugh for Halloween and I'm Glad you wear a I've got just outfit and I'm at a gamble and I'm not a sign or on the ... I like beer\nAnd and that's going to be like Oscar I I don't I don't really understand why a what would be you know what would be problematic for this a as a kid or an adult\nNow on the Megan Kelly thing ... did you should do or show back in the day is Fox I feel like you\nProbably were in the mix for that I'm the first person that ever ... ever put me on prime time at Fox so I said yesterday that I feel like I have some\nYou know as I have a certain fondness for Megan but then again I think she made ... incredibly bad decisions when it comes to weave in how she left Fox wins you love box where she went from Fox but to me it couldn't be any more obvious they just wanted to get rid of her I mean this was really the ... what you said really wasn't like fire rubble offense\n\nWell no one will fence I mean this is sort of what happens in the media is I think but\nNBC's looking for an excuse to get rid of backing Kelly ratings are taking a she wasn't getting into the network and I think is is that the number one opportunity I say there was a major major conflict\n... this is the same network but kept Matt Lauer around for decades and this is the thing that I wouldn't want Ronan Farrow to publish reporting on R B wind scene on our website so this is a huge double standard\nYeah and and I I gotta say this is where we'll also see the one on one of my maximum is that the less takes care of its own where you can get\nTerminated or on the left unless you were actually are known predator or something really terrible you know you're actually doing something that's border line up to and including they'd be criminal or you can have a second active you've already seen who's the guy who was the comedian Louis the caves coming like these other people\nI think men Kelly done I don't think that you know may maybe she'll be a you know selling slow cooker is only the home shopping network or something but I don't think any major networks going to give her another shock because there's only one place where to go and she left\nThe Megan Kelly in a like infomercial for a you know to ...\nStay cookers would be amazing yes ah that yeah that would that would be that would be absolutely amazing but you're exactly right I mean we've got to figure out I I have no idea I I I just ... on fire all of her credentials with conservatives and the concern was really loved her over Boston not all ...\nAnd then the people that you see the left at NBC they didn't like her and the first place\nSo they started lip both sides on fire so where does she go from here and she's not going back to Fox\nAh and I\nYou know and I I don't think anyone else is going to see the investment studying million dollars are really being a meaningful or worthwhile investment because she didn't have it delivered on reading\nAnd and and what university where it's Seventy million dollars by the way I mean who whose idea was that\nI don't know that we're ... interview remember that that was a big break out she went and interviewed ... and\nIt doesn't even speak English how much of an interview to that really be let's get serious ... second she can't even communicate with it\nEveryone criticize or I mean up and down for what you are for firing for the sex and feel for everything uh it just didn't work out I just the whole time for making Kelly at NBC was an ad on mitigated disaster I think leading Fox was a huge huge issue and people that are conservative in\nThe media you just got to know that there are a long night for you wherever you go yup it is true\nBennett Johnston everybody follow him on Twitter whose Twitter ... amazing also go to a Daily Caller to see his latest over there which Betty Johnson have a fantastic weekend or are you dressing up in ... by the way I didn't get to us\nI guess yes I I Will be I I Will be dressed up as a as per capita I'm a a I Will be will be going as a brick out all with the ... and uh I like beer sign around my neck judges rape and a cattle wrong\nYou you are triggering lives left and right Betty Johnson everybody I've talked to\nBanks bought RJ more coming they would they\n\n\nDo have something you want to say but you just can't

liquid agent with the true story that could save you hundreds of dollars a year a woman named Linda just called her husband re has a three hundred thousand dollar group life insurance policy but it's changing jobs and can't take it with him\nI shocked the many highly rated term life insurance companies we represent\nAnd found re who was forty one and takes medication to control his cholesterol a tenure five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty seven dollars a month that's almost twice the coverage for less than half of what he had paid if select quota hasn't shop for your life insurance you're probably paying too much for your free quote cult\nAnd we see that a lot of the people you know they cut some of the Central Americans do come to Mexico and some of them do stay Mexicans don't like that either because they say it lowers their wages that they worry about crime punting into ... more crime then that's how you deal with and I was watching some of them\n... after you about it specifically because I\nI always think it's so interesting when you talk to people who are legal immigrants you this is a perspective that order or rather have legal immigrants and their family or is it perspective it doesn't get your nearly enough in the media all I hear\nOn on all but one of the channels that the governor's day in and day out is essentially sob stories about how anyone who wants to come here should be able to come here I mean well I get emails and phone calls at an all kinds of messages into my program from illegal immigrants who were like you don't just get to ... literally walk here and say I get to say\n[laughter] ... so I I like I was saying I was watching some of the reports from Univision and us and they wanted their reporters went out and interviewed people in Florida and California the typically Hispanic that you speak Spanish and they were saying that uh\nYou know just like the president says\nPeople are welcome here but they need to go through the process just like we did end up with all its bad actually at the record or just look kind of blown away he wasn't expecting to answer it because what we're told by the liberal media that this is all about racism that this country doesn't want brown people here which is absolutely one hundred percent thought citizen about your skin\nColor just is about our nation wide our immigration laws I think it doesn't matter I imagine if seven thousand people were you know going through the ... from Russia I've gone to Canada storming the border there\nWe wouldn't be okay with that this had nothing to do with their skin color or your President Trump laid without really nicely that we need a lot of people and cared based on merit and you know we don't need a bunch of low skilled workers right now and you know like I said we have to pass up after that\nBut we need to put the country first and this isn't going to benefit us if we allow this to continue to happen it sends the wrong message and we're just going to continue to lead in the whole world's poor and America would eventually turn into a third world country so we want to protect but we have\nAnd you know aside from all of that ... ... for the most part they bring their politics and so these are cleaning people that are eat I'm not maybe they're like not even really super political but they're coming they're running away from countries\nAt what leftist politicians that have been pushing lasted policies that are destroying their own country at the end of the dating people need to be held accountable they need to clean up their country they need to go after the drug cartel ... corruption and if you look at what the president has been doing you know we we have a lot of things going on here President Trump wants to crack down\nOn a on strikes in general like that that he's got the war on drugs going on and it seems like there's push back on that like people just aren't really interested in stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border not only that killing American more than anything else I mean this is a huge epidemic\nBut I also this is what the drug cartels are driving on if we can shut down that would really stop isn't it for them and you know maybe they would stop a you know hurting their own people\nWorking people go to watch your commentaries and see what you got going on a Daily Caller\nOkay yeah so they can check me out a Daily Caller dot com they can follow me on Twitter I put a lot of videos that go on interviews and also a Fox five

parents coming down to Washington DC this weekend\nThey have spent very little time in the swamp I'd I'd be willing to bet my parents probably have an overnight it in DC in Twenty years so it'll be falling to show them around a little bit and uh you know see what they think of\nThis funky little town that is our nation's capital to be a lot of farmers to eat a lot of good food and have some

are ... ah I'm\nNot really clear on exactly what you're asking me here buddy but I Do appreciate the car note thank you very much really writes book since it is technically an invasion can Trump the quarter of the border a war zone and limit media access so they can't use the pictures of the poor women and children just wandering\nSex re I don't think that [noise] well\nYou know I think that maybe you could occur to national emergency but I don't think he'd be able to court a war zone practically only Congress can declare war but here's where things get interesting\nBecause I explained to you that in terms of what the law is now and we're Congress actually is on this issue of the border and immigration\nThey can claim of this caravan can claim asylum and there was nothing\nTo stop them necessarily from that book\nThe president as we know from the whole kerfuffle over the Muslim ban does have the ability to declare any group of aliens to be a problem for national security purposes and to borrow them entry to the United states\nTherefore the president put under his national security authority as the commander in chief and this was in a congressional statute right now the president could say you're not allowed to come into this country because you were a national security threat on the commander in chief that's just the way that it is this\nThough would be challenged immediately in the courts the press would completely freak out on on this whole situation as you can imagine and ah I'm not sure\nHow it would even be resolved but I Do think that that just war gaming assault a little bit that could happen as keeping the press away I'm not comfortable with trying to prevent the media from seeing something that's actually going on so I I Would not want that to happen um I don't I don't I think the media should be\nAble to report on what's going on in war zones or the media should be able to report on pretty much anything that's happening here with the possible exception of things that are a him in a national security risk troop movements in a like a aries\n...
