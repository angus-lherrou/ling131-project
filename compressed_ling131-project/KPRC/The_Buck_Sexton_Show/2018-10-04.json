[noise]\nThe right does not have that problem the lip does [noise]\nI was actually there is always today Christie were below average signed me to Jesse Jesse Kelly dot com [noise]\n\nYou did America studios\n\n\nDeadly police shooting in South Carolina I'm Lisa ... Fox News new details in the shooting of police officers and shared Japanese in Florence county toxicity Rapaport has more live\nClear proof one way or the other factor it in\nWe heard so much what oh she'd be the polygraph I shouldn't say well that was maybe friday and right there she was cleared by the polygraph maybe you could say polygraph said that she was not being deceptive she was being truthful what if she knows how to be to step up on a polygraph\nIf she knows how to do that by the way that would indicate that you lied under oath and if you lied under oath about the polygraph by the way I still don't believe that she took the polygraph not knowing she was going to come forward so I've always thought that was a lie but if you wrote about taking the polygraph than\nWe know that she's not delusional then she's actually a malicious actor here\nAnd given that we've been told including by sending US Senators that millions of lives are at stake millions of women's lives are at stake if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court which is in the same thing to say that it is pretty widespread among Democrats\nWhy is it so hard to believe that somebody would try and do something that they would view as a great act of heroism and that they will be heralded for on the left for generations to come for that or do you think that that's that show one single\nThat's so\nNot credible really I find that hard to believe\nThose who today we're criticizing Trump for weighing in here seem to forget that just because there are allegations are now falling apart it doesn't mean that the rest of us have forgotten how disgusting how disgraceful how underhanded they have been all along in their effort to try and derail this cabinet nomination\nThat has been their purpose and they have been willing to do anything and everything in order to get there that they're now is a more defensive position than they have been you know ... I saw\nHad a another sworn declaration today that a person was at parties in the eighties there was drinking and ... and ... knew the Kavanaugh was that these parties\nI mean at what point are we just putting high school drinking and socializing or in some kind of weird public trial here I mean there there's no names there's no allegations of specific criminality oh yeah\nI I'll swear I'll swear testimony out that I went to a party long time ago and there are people who are drinking and having premarital sex and that was happening okay that's not ... you can't just prove that you're not gonna get in trouble for perjury and also doesn't prove anything they have an easy thing it was election I keep I\nKeep running into they should be ashamed but are they have no shame and they view this as an end justifies the means to a situation and that's why I Want to remind everybody right now\nWe've got to keep our eye and the ball here\nThis has never been this has never been about getting to the truth this delay is not about getting to the truth it's not about being fair to Kavanaugh or even respecting the processed in any meaningful sense\nThis has been do anything to get the Democrats' way that's what this is\nAnd I'm concerned we've got a lot of time is going to pass between now and friday there was a lot of room for them to come up with something and you've seen the narrative shift oh the FBI investigation is in Folsom\nThey haven't done enough um you've seen that happen but there's another component to this to this is where I'm the most concerned\nTo how I could see a vote failing or the Senate not having the boats one or the other and that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this\nBrink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb\nIf Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside here so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around\nTrump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing a there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as came across to me it's very strange it a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going on the media and saying well well\nI was I had a sexual assault in my password I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically him a ...\nCompletely on cannabis unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegations\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed but this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was fed so much by politics but also by the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford\nSituation you'll notice the second or the second\nAllegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweat Nick they barely even discussing that any more\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying\nAs we found out with her near as and in the third case was sweating it it's an intelligence test watched that interview with Julie sweating where she's talking about gang rape and being in community\nCollege and hanging out with high school kids all this stuff and and if you think that she's being truthful don't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if you think she's being truthful your your skills of discernment and analysis are\nAh are lacking to say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here\nDon't be fooled for a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there\nTo say hold on a second\nThere is some big gap there is some whole there's women were lying are we to believe the second and third are lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is Oso honest\nI have a hard time believing that now we can speak honestly and truthfully about what has been said tuition last week in week and a half\nAnd\nWe need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down capital now it's going to be all we need bipartisanship oh\nThey're switching to deep dives into anything and everything they can find from his background file that's right now they're saying the problem\nIs that the background checks the FBI did in the past six background checks that should all be public information\nHere in a letter to the Democrats and the letter the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee\nChallenged the accuracy of a tweet from majority Republicans on Tuesday that said nowhere in at least six FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there any a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual abuse or alcohol abuse\nUm so they're now saying oh no guess what there's bad stuff in his in his raw background reports remember the FBI submit that stuff and then there's an adjudication for things like if you have to get a security clearance or if you have to\nYou know it it but the FBI does not make the final determination to serve it to make a determination when it comes to this issue of whether someone's fit to be on the Supreme Court\nUm but they want more information and when they don't get this information they're going to say oh well the real problem you she isn't the isn't the information they need for the\nFrom the new background check or the reopen background checks now they're trying to suggest that they're stuffing those six other background checks that shows that Kavanaugh doesn't have the temper that he is a bad guys drunk meaning he's a sex abuser all this stuff\nJust\nMore more ambushes and then smoke screen more not more nonsense more garbage and this is where if I were somebody who used profanity on radio I think I'd have to throw some into the mix you were to describe what's going on\n\nDemocrats have something else here I'm telling you there's something else they're going to all you know they they they are going to leak something if they can from his background from his background files are going to find something to add into the mix year\nSo that they can say well you know you know even if Kavanaugh was not a rapist or a gang rape is which is what they were saying last week even if that's not true\nNow we have to take into account that his um past\nIs spotty in some ways so there was some places where it seems like you might have had too much to drink it I saw this letter about how he you know they should tell the neighbors that there are a lot of when they were in high school or high school seniors there's too much drinking a little bit of feuding\nThat's that's on whether you think it's unfortunate behavior or not I mean whether you think it's a big deal or not that's pretty common place among millions and millions of Americans and Democrats\nThe party of Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy all of a sudden being Puritans oh my gosh alcohol and like men and women mixing of parties\nThat seems to me to be just as as brazen as it gets\nBut they're saying here that the information and he's six background investigations that have already happened that's what has\nTo come out now also note that blondes e Ford's lawyers will not hand over her polygraph examination notes or her therapist notes until she gets to speak to the FBI\n[noise] here we go again why is the wise blondes before why does she require speaking the FBI she already gave her statement under penalty of perjury\nTo the house the Senate Judiciary committee so why does she need to get the same she's going to give it ... if she gets a different statement to the FBI\nThen she's lying and we've got a big problem that she's in criminal jeopardy so she's not going to give a different state in the FBI so what's with this only give you information the FBI oh that's right more excuse more complain more delay\nWhich is the name of the game which is why flakes all thing I always found out since the late last friday was that we should have had the vote last friday in the lake is a moron that's what we found out that's all we found out so far there's that that the information that's come to light has just been\nFurther evidence that cabinet or should have gotten his vote last\nWeek when they plan to do it and this is not healing the nation at all and I'm telling you they've got something else it's going to have tomorrow [noise]\nThey're going to put something they're they're cooking something up behind the scenes I I I don't know exactly what it is but I think it's going to be about something unrelated to sexual assault now\nThey're going to say that Kavanaugh's an alcoholic or something like that just look in his ... and oh by the way he lied about being an alcoholic the proof\nIs in the records that the public's not supposed to be able to see [noise]\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that that is that\nHe was clearly glitter and\nAggressive angry angry with Rand thinking if I had it\nI was astonished at his as his ran I mean he's a judge she's a sitting\nCircuit court judge you supposed to be nonpartisan\nThat part of the race and that's the fun judicial thing you can do he showed no judicial temperament but we know one thing he does not have the temperament\nCan credibly on the court and claim to be impartial what that meant like [laughter]\nIn the late ... painting full of party thing ... on that have off\nHe showed a lack of judicial temperament someone at biased and its uncontrolled in his rage temperament is just south ... quest\nFor\nFilled with rancor and re animates\nArrogant and I think that\nThe kind of temperament is reflective of those allegations as well\nJust sat in his anger is triggered and what we saw today it's someone who you can see attacking a one and it's very frightening\nI don't know if these idiots all believe what they're saying or if they're just saying what they think is going to get them the most to claim on the left but how do they think that somebody should react to being called a gang rape is with no evidence\nTo having their their life ruined on national TV the reputation destroyed every well what are they really think you sit there and saying yeah you know I'm Sorry I just disagree with your assessment\nRemember that\nHe gave an interview and the week where he was very measured very calm you know ... ... even ... the whole time on Fox nursing vets are guilty ... I mean er an innocent person reaction speaking to\nSo that he goes in there and he's like well the fix is definitely in um at least going down fighting and gave me an incredible performance and what it really is is they're they're just they're just now acting like a bunch of spoiled\nBrats 'cause they didn't get their way they thought they had and they thought after that at that for testimony he was going to get his nomination was going to get yanked and he came out there and he stole from them what they thought they had just with all their all their little schemes that their coordination behind the scenes the less media Democrats they all thought they had it\nThen Kavanaugh's just said nope not yet\nNot yet\nAnd his his temperament is bad he's been a judge for how long now it's been a it's been on the D.C court of appeals which is the second most important the second most important cord the country after Supreme Court\nAnd its Brewster my points out he kept his cool even though people were acting like complete\nSavages during the hearing I mean these protesters\nScreaming and acting like total maniac kept his cool through all that", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "04"}
