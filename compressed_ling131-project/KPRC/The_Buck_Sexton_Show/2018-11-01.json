response to her\nCompletely insane statement on air which he did that have to back down from and apologize 'cause it was so dumb that it was indefensible but but in response to that I said this is not even the dumbest thing\nThat you will see or hear on CNN all week ... not even this week will that be the single most in because we got an election coming up next week ... people are going to try to out to one another on the left with stupid hyperbolic destructive nasty comments\nI said it wasn't the dumbest thing this week and I present to you to prove me correct none other\nThan Mr Don Lemon ... pie too\nI keep trying to force people not to demonize any one group or any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat of something else some some some people who were marching you know tours of order like a feminine and when the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know\nMost of them to get into the country most of them are tired you know got stuck it out before they even made it to the border um so we have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized ... up to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere is no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nThat's right folks multimillionaire CNN anchor\nSays we need to stop demonizing people comma and understand that white men on the right or the real threat they're the real evil the real monsters maybe we should ban them from traveling\nI didn't make him saying I'm not taking his words out of context I'm just playing for you what he said on national TV\nAnd you can say about why there's so much for a while either you're focusing on there's a ... no no no he is representative of the overall mindset on the left that's why we did the montage this is this is what these people this is what the other side the left\nThe Democrats what they think they really believe that they're not the problem at all when it comes to nasty\nOverheated dangerous rhetoric the other side is the problem dot dot dot because the other side's a bunch of evil racist Nazi big ... you know ... ... vehicles with blood on their hands\nOh\nI see that that is at\nThe heart of why we're having\nSuch a a descent into political madness in this country they don't even have the self awareness that don't even have the the the the honesty to be able to understand that you are not going to improve the temperature\nOf political rhetoric if in fact your go to position is that the political rhetoric\nIs bad because the other side is basically Hitler\nAnd I wasn't exactly how many how many references to rights and you know the right stacked fires Nazis and ever did you hear that opening montage\n\nThis is how they think about the other side and you know what it you know what it really drives a lot of this\nIs the success of the successes that Trump has and the relative failures of the eight years of Obama's and before it or that\nThey told us they being all the opponents to the Trump movement they told us that he would fail miserably that he was completely in over his head that he had no idea what he was doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they would be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences\nOf having Donald Trump as president but you see\nWe have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and it's suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton of investment no massive\nForeign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions that are going to stand our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that the powers that be already been clear on how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's those are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've felt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there is a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of some of the most celebrated\nNames in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from other lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite\nThey they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all of their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left belief and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their progressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if they can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York\nTimes isn't liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people vote\nDemocrat it rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up right we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that as the the center of our our media apparatus that's never coming back that's gone\nNow we now we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least push back there will be a fight over it\nBut the calls for civility from Democrats for the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nThank you very much danger had her name is good you know they may be longer [laughter]\nSo that was the reception that President Trump Maloney a Yvonne ... and Jared\nReceived when they went to the hospital where I Believe uh the some of the the shooting victims from the the terrible anti Semitic hate crime in Pittsburgh were being treated there there you\nHave all of that and that was unscripted I there's there's video of it you can see they're just\nThe the first family is walking by and all those people you heard that they're just want to say thank you they really appreciate the president came out there in a show of solidarity and a show of support\nAnd an effort to let people know let the people in the community Pittsburgh and what those who have been directly affected by this know that the president had states\nIs there for them at the the government and the American people and the the symbolism here of course is that the the representative of the American people is there in support and solidarity with the victims and with the city of Pittsburgh\nAnd what what's happened to that can be what's happened to the Jewish community there\nIn the last week this should be as straightforward\nAnd a non partisan a thing as is possible right I mean there there's nothing about this that should raise anyone's hackles there's nothing about this that should get anybody upset\nAnd yet and yet as we know are\nThere are so many people so many people who made this an issue\nOf Trump not you know from being a bad guy here\nSomehow Trump is not welcome that's what they were saying not welcome\nHuffington Post today I now see I go to these things I go to these things because these sites so that the rest of you don't have to spend your time rooting around in the bowels of the left his mind but the really the the second top story on that site\nIs Trump's visit to a city that didn't want him\nThis is just disgusting\nThey find a few people here and there they find some left wing activist who don't want the president there and they used that they strap away from that\nSomehow but the city of Pittsburgh does not want the ... the United states to show up and then they report that as news this is how they play the games is is how you see the bias occurred\nI anyone could do this oh I found three people and they all agree with me on something and then I read a story the people of D. C. J. that D.C.'s going Republican next year\nWas that based on anything that's worth telling anybody that I asked three three people that were we wasted outside of a bar who were just trying to pull my legs I mean what what what's going on here\nThis is how they do with this is how the left\nEngages in his manipulation of reality and they really just wanted to make this even ... a more divisive moment make it even more difficult for the president\nOf the United states to be able to do his job here which is to try and help and he'll be American people by turning us into some\nYou know bash Trump's session these people\nAre a disgrace and you don't it really comes down to they don't believe that he's the president they just they they don't accept it not my president\nMy president you remember that the chance on the streets they think that he's not just not their president but he is not the president period\nUnfortunately they are wrong but they're delusional enough that they think it doesn't matter how they shouldn't be a shame but as we see [noise]\nProgressive there aren't capable of shame these days\nHer health is good for your overall health bad dental health is bad for your overall health made your smile wants you to have clean healthy white straight teeth\nThrough a one to six five eleven eleven to eight one to six five eleven eleven and all that summer and I too have opened two or three trees in Texas if you are buying a home an office building you want a mortgage [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bug sexiness back\nSome lines lists and the freedom of team let's get to Charlie in Maryland hello sir\nThank you for taking my call like I Know you're going to get on the subject of is a burst right deal and if people are informed of the fourteen conch constitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal\nYep\nOh I'm In it that in death coming up later on the show but just a I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no court has held illegal aliens\nOr should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens means there's not a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic or their children born here should be automatic citizens it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this ... children of slaves\nOr the ... yeah the fourteenth amendment was ... it was for yet that the descendants of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions in overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's\nWing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie ... is with the Democrats don't really understand\nIs that no matter what once again they are showing their tipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country ah yeah they always take the side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and yeah he has every right to do that\nYeah I think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much Charlie for ... calling from Maryland ... even in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Steven\nHey hey hey Mr ... the wisest one I I really enjoy your show your your your discussions are extremely thoughtful I really appreciate that you're very kind\nOn the other thing that they don't want to mention and it's believed that the thing of ties in with Don Lemon da da da da da da da and so ... they were down towards losing working class voters on and especially with the Trump presidency they've lost a lot of union ... this is their animals\nTowards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I Wonder and wondering is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare all day because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out because one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in this country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it is black and white to pound and a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that technically\nNew immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe states are so you cannot be a dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system\nIs set up a as we know that's not the case what ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have in as a child who is a is is given citizenship either to a to a legal parents then\nBenefits accrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a two year old you don't give a newborn\nA government benefits you have to give it to the parents and ... so there are ways that families 'cause they also will\n\nEverybody it's ... and I'm here in Studio in the freedom hot with mark Bachmann the c._e._o. of global verification network you know mark when people hear about vetting and

find that in our local [noise] his ... website for a full time [noise]\nDuring early voting ... hanging from harmful for him\n[noise]\nThis is a perfect example what I'm Talking about here you have a a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he he tweeted out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass\nShooters who are white males that were if anything political\nLeftist but you know that this is this is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that they will\nUh they'll talk about all this um and yet when you start to break this down you say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of\n... in this country um\nTurns out that's not true it turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation\nOr for all the different ethnic groups in this country but are you hearing what you find out they've never mass shooting summertime an overall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about\nSome communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly distributed\nUm but Ninety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male\nSo as a river we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat\nI'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy with some radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country\nThe country's also Seventy percent white\nSo if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and a country is Seventy percent white but only fifty four percent of mass shooters are white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nUm of other groups that are not away their shoes so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places I think there are only making about this and we want to remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many a white mass shooters in the country so why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and really pointless exercise\nUm but they'll laugh like to do this because I think of us all based upon our\nOur ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity or whether we agree with that or or not\nUm then you get a ... and I'll I'll just make this brief ah that that the G George mafia\nA moron from Charlottesville is talked about so much in the media it just goes to show you that they can't find wherever that where's this these white nationalist I'm always hearing about I'm not saying they don't exist and say how many are there really\nVery very few and you refer to that as a rise of of real terrorism in the country and that that the biggest terrorist threat and people like that or people like this pipe bomber guy uh we don't have the TSA because of the pipe bomb or we don't have the national\nCounterterrorism center\nAnd the multibillion now going on trillions of dollars are spent on a security apparatus for this country of all kinds because we're worried about\nRight wing nationalist terrorism we have it because of Islamic radicalism All right let's be in the post nine eleven security apparatus we have is specifically designed to deal with the threat of radical Islam\nAnd I know that right now we're in a little bit of a lull in terms of radical Islamic you know knock on wood radical Islamic attacks in the United states\nBut that doesn't mean that that's not the primary threat and people who say this garbage about how\nThe real concern the real terrorists threat the real threat of extremist violence comes from white nationalist or are being\nDisingenuous and they don't know what they're talking about I Know that there are major a major departments and agencies that yes they they do have a they do have you know some entities that deal with\nYou know radical a neo Nazis and things like that they have very very little work to do day in and day out folks\nCounterterrorism at the science you uh you know ... and right wing nationalist us off they're not busy it is the counter jihadist folks that are always very\nWait until Black Friday for a great

up to twenty six percent off plus get pre Black Friday flooring deals like thirty two percent off boulevard and ...\nThat then there's also what I see from our own side and you know I've very frustrated with us today but not not surprising at all\n[noise]\nYeah I Know he's not running anymore but you'd think that after all the time it's been a concern circumvent here's here's Paul Ryan not a constitutional scholar not a lawyer but then again neither am I but I seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan\nA but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is a very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and birth to ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... current and following the plain text of the constitution I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [laughter]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here which is on track illegal immigration\nA [noise]\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a four and ... if a foreign country can say hey hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction is you really subject to ...\nI mean you know this is where he started to get it okay hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American\nTaxes would you have to do and when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you said well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French ... a French French joy all French soil or I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen\nI took a jurisdiction has not just about geography and that's where this gets more that's what this gets more complicated and there are instances already of where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen right in the case of the sons of insult us diplomats who were born here and they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship\nSo that's\nA place where there's no clarity it off and the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs and has just been so wimpy end immigration for so long\nAnd for him when he's not running again that come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ... to the G O P side I got to say I was I was pleased that at least at least from was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see that are\nHere we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul right look is one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this\nAnd you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue but that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay\nIn maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels whatever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not with Walter but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly has all all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings it back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country because I think that the Republican Party is better for the country therefore I support the Republican Party it's a you know they're bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's\nA who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the Senate or other Joe Donnelly\nHere's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both\nOn the campaign side\nAnd on the Senate side\nOr state director is Indian American\nBut he does an amazing job\nOr director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job then you could ever imagine [laughter]\nIs this guy saying I mean\nCould you imagine if a Republican said I Know he misspoke but wow hey a producer Mike you there\nOh All right well gosh cruiser my cigarette break up a DJ brand it I just won't let you know that uh you're oh you're oh you're a white guy but you're pretty good at your job as what you do that doesn't\nSound like much of a government does it bread banks I think I mean brand and you you your your name is Brenda you're a white dude but you'd be amazed at how good you are at running the board for this show people would be like her\nYeah exactly\nSo this is what you get this this is the Democrats the best and the brightest bugs the Democrat Party senator\nJoe and Joe Donnelly this is this is what the other side offers up at the Republican did it that would probably be the end\n[noise] some [noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an

gun toting Democrat and all this stuff but at the other day they disappoint because they're really it's a much more left wing party than they're willing to say say openly and honestly\nAnd the Democrats are now led by people on the left I mean when I say let her do just me and her leadership in elected office I just mean the ideology of the modern Democratic Party has gone much further to\nThe left then people\nAre in the Democratic party are are willing to be honest about 'em and that's why I think we have such a so much just not\nDisagreement at this point but it's like we see the world and he's completely different terms what's because from dealing with a bunch of quasi comedies who don't pay any attention to history and think capitalism is bad I think that the government's always good the bigger the government the better and you know white males or an oppressive terrible force in the world the need to be brought to heal if\nThat's what I'm doing way it's really tough to be like yeah let's find a middle ground so just remember polo seeing the Democrats lie about being moderate and unfortunately Republicans lie about being conservative [noise] that's\nThe way this way [noise]\n\n\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's

comes to the fight for some members tough [noise]\nSo we have more in that position in the first places because Democrats have failed to come to the table staff failed to work with this president and pass legislation that helps protect our country that helps protect the citizens of America because they do not want to secure our borders they do not want to have a law and order a country\nThat the reason that we're in this predicament if the Democrats in Congress has failed to do their jobs and the president's going to look at any way possible that he can find\nA legally unconstitutionally that to make sure that we're doing everything we can\nThis has been a long standing debate there's good faith arguments on both sides so natural reading of this amendment which seem to support unlimited birthright citizenship for the history\nThe tax some of the draft ers tend to go the other way and courts view who's clauses like this is having meaning they don't trust us dispensed them you can make a disease can certainly make a good faith arguments and it limits birth racism birthright citizenship\nYeah you can see your point\nYou first of all the Sarah Huckabee Sanders I'm with her or the Democrats they can't have it both ways they can't be the law's the law and then be well but we're not going to do when you're in force band that let's not being mean and what's not separate families and all the rest of the you can have it both ways and they wouldn't have it both ways with immigration all the time\nThey want to say they want a strong border but they don't want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border\nThey say they want an orderly immigration system but they don't want to do interior enforcement is that there should be consequences roiling the law but they don't want them to get prosecuted instead home or anything else right so this is classic and then with the constitutional aspect to it I have to say\nThe only thing that amuses me more than media lives discovering the constitution is written media lips discovered the Bible\nYou know and you know that's when all of a sudden you hear Corinthians to to [laughter] you're like wait what what are they talking about\nThe uh so I I I Love the I Love the\nFor songs I'm going to read you now from the book of poems\nThey say in the media uh yeah so this is where\nYou see that they they have no actual principle that they are protecting or that there there are trying to Institute here because they're ... they're very literal list in a interpretation of this clause\nLet's understand is it's just not it's not clear what that means and also to take a literal interpretation of the constitution also takes into account what was it meant you mean at the time right this is where liberals would go to the right to bear arms you could have ... million in Brussels that's why we said arms\nYes at the time it wasn't a are Fifteen it was ... but guess what it is arms and that's why it leaves it leaves open for what arms were then what arms are now\nAh and that's why the press the press has any dissemination of information the press is not an actual printing press\nAnd the jurisdiction there of okay well what does that exactly mean what does that mean based upon the understanding that the time in what they were trying to achieve with this amendment with the fourteenth amendment\nI'm remember that the Obama administration\nUm first of all there's all this there's all this rewriting of history now about what the Democrats have been doing an immigration for the last Twenty years and here's a here's a great example of of of that you have Harry Reid\nOkay this is even before that this was Nineteen Ninety three but this is Harry Reid who was among the most powerful Democrats in the country until recently this is what he had to say about illegal aliens play quibbling\nKept making any money to be an illegal alien is not\nAbout offering a reward for being an illegal\nYou know same country wouldn't do that\nIf you break the law\nWith US citizenship\nThat's right we do\nThis was like okay you know if if I Rob a bank I'll get in trouble but my kid who didn't do anything wrong you know my my baby when he grows up he gets the trust fund I made with the money from robbing the bank\nDishes ill gotten gains they could try to think of it any other way they want they tried to go with other explanations of it but that's just the truth\nAnd you know ... now you have this debate over the fourteenth amendment of the fourteenth amendment let's just get right to it right now uh it's all about making sure that after the civil war has written eight in sixty six after the civil war\nThere was no question as a matter of law that African Americans will be granted or or had would even be granted we had\n[noise] for them I guess I have a nice warm [noise] hope I now pass on that and\nPolitical building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany

[noise]\n[noise]\nThey have help stop or a lot of the transportation names of these individuals and the caravan forcing them out walking they have helped out a new way to slow this down to write this up and keep it from moving as aggressively towards the United states\nTruth is these caravans though are being driven by leftist organizations in Central America [noise] they are in by human traffickers who do need to know have no regard for human life you\nKnow or the more information we're getting\nOn all of this the more information we have on this caravan more obvious it becomes that ah yeah that's right there are people behind this\nThere are people who are involved in organizing and funding and and pushing this whole thing forward a literally and figuratively 'em and you know what am I been\nSaying all along that there's this talking points\nAre there are thousands of miles away and now they're dying hundred and Ninety nine miles away you know\nThis was ridiculous because\nWhat we're already seeing now is according to NBC News an hour ago\nOh that's right now that they've assembled and gotten all this attention they're not planning on walking the whole way\nThey've advanced two hundred and fifty miles into Mexico and you have them asking quote for buses weary Margaret caravan residents of Mexico asks for buses that's right\nYou got about four thousand four thousand people saying that you know they want buses\nAnd organizers oh that's right it's not an organized event my friends but they're organizers somehow they got organizers who are\nUh are trying to get all these buses to materialize and get this whole thing going and we're supposed to believe that there's that this is just all spontaneous this just came together because there's no there's really nothing in it beyond that there's only two of beyond that it is is\nJust nuts it's just nuts and there's such nastiness out\nThere right now about Trump's sending more troops to the border again they're saying oh it's political theater it's political theater\nWell I mean the the military is not going to engage in a military sense the military just as they would use you know when we send National Guard or will when we have military that assist in a natural disaster zone\nNo one stupid enough to suit or what what they're gonna do send or ... new houses that have been blown down with no\nObvious your militaries there to help to assist in whatever way they can because the interests of the nation and and it's people or the interest of the United states military\nAnd ... this is the commander in chief taking it upon himself to try and it's just our border patrol and it's also a show of seriousness\nIt's also meant to say hey you know whatever we can do we will do and we want border patrol to feel like they have the full backing in support of the federal government which would not only are they not have under the Obama administration did not have one of the Bush administration\nThe Bush is are bad on the border\nYou heard it here if you've never heard of before you probably heard me say it though but the bushes were battling border issues I mean George W was he was he was really a McCain conservative in many ways I mean he was a squishy\nOn on some of these very weak on border issues and an immigration issues but we just didn't pay much attention to it because we you know how the really existential fight against radical Islamic terrorism going on [noise]\nUm but I I think that the president is from a purely political perspective making the right choices here to show the difference what is the difference when it comes to immigration between the Democrats and Republicans and the Democrats\nDon't really want to fix anything they want to legalize more and more people that don't want the laws to be enforced they don't want a system that privileges of those who will bring special skills and be a more easily able to contribute to the economy in a net positive what they don't want any of that\nThey want as many unskilled\nA limited education non English speaking workers as possible or even non workers be what's going on over there was maybe it was possible as quickly as possible because this is how the left as it gets crazier and crazier and more and more socialist\nThinks that they can turn America into a one party state a one party ...\nA democratic socialist state run by the Democratic party immigration is is central to that plan do not forget it\n[noise] there's a revolt that has been brewing for some time among conservatives because we understand that social media giants out there have they left word too and we're sick of it we don't want our conversations to be clipped to be steered in other directions or just to be entirely shutdown\nThat's why there are places to go now where you could actually share your thoughts and ideas\nWithout worrying about bias and all this other nonsense coming into the equation no agenda know hidden tools that sniff the dot com ... dot com it's a new social media sites where you can post engage with others share your thoughts\nAnd just have the conversation role naturally you don't have to worry about them using your information and ways you don't like you don't have to worry about them banning you were shadow betting you or any of that stuff\nAnd if you're a conservative and you don't want to have to ever deal with the moderators in garbage that's out there nippy dot com it's a place to go as an I.

Santa\nYou know it's not hard for you to be that his passion stopping a bunch of baby stop being a bunch of crybaby\nYou know at some acting like because people at Trump rallies yell mean things to you every conservative I Know has been who's in media has been getting a horrible things centered them said about them death threats all kinds of and some of them actually get assaulted and attacked I can think\nOf prominent conservatives being physically assaulted in the snow and cold there was one of the tax giving a speech once on camera you know people have actually been a doesn't happen to lives lives don't get it can deliver lives when they're giving speeches don't get attacked\nIt's just not the same and it's not the same mentality out there right now you know the Trump people see this is really the difference that I Know that ... ... what about the Trump supporter you're the guy was the media and their maniacs can support and you know anyone in anything\nAnd I mean we hear very little about the family Research Council shooter for example but he was all about you know the MSNBC talking points and and wanted to wanted to kill people who were\nPro life and and pro traditional family or you know how a lot of you're probably the buck would even talking about if you go and do a you know do a quick Google Search on that you'll be like wow this guy was a left wing terrorist but no one ever refers to them that way he was that's what he was he was he left for any and he actually shot people\nSo it wasn't it wasn't just an attempted something or wasn't just sending in threats he actually took the kind of like the Bernie Sanders shooter who\nDidn't try to show up at a baseball field but got caught on my way or something got there in shock people and almost killed them very nearly killed Steve ... so but Stewart understands this this dynamic and now now look I Am a big\nCritic of the whole John Stewart clown nose on clown nose off thing it's like you know it's like ... I'm Down to it I'm all funny honk honk and then oh well now let me lecture you well on the constitution in my crusty on I'm I'm poor impression voice it's like no if you want to engage in political issues you have to do when\nYou have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have\nI just have fake puppets going into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest\nAnd Stuart's done lots of that you know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke to write so dumb ha ha\nAnd that was what he did I mean he really just choke what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you read the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there was reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this\nBut the live idea always\nComes out on top and that's the ... with those outlets do to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is is winning but the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality\nThis is just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example launder Z liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind what the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN's apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe in the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead they're liars they're liars tapper liar\nBlitzer liar I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis Cooper all around all of them I mean Donald limited uh like a whole other that's a whole other level but\nYou know he's right about that as George right about the narcissism point and it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think the steward has come upon some bit of brilliance ear yeah the narcissism is what the narcissism is what the\nTrump taps into of because look he understands people with big egos Trump is a very very big ... I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that we will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that\nBecause even if something else is kind of like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believed could happen\nSo I think the guy's gotta earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember\nAnd then you know be humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a for Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing that they can come up with\nAs an answer because it's so once you get told you go oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta wires every a criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over inflated senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you hear the Serbian all the time I Am lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this than\nA vast majority of people were in the business and I don't say that to be a modest and just being object and being honest with you and very few people can carry a three hour a day scripted unscripted rather radio show very very few people can really do that\nUm but that's not to say that I also don't realize I'm lucky I Am lucky to be able to do this for a living I Am lucky that this is my job this is my job\nIs just my calling in my career because of all of you who listen to the show\nYou are the reason that I can do this and it's only through my service my constant effort to meet the expectations and the information or entertainment or needs of this wonderful audience all of you listening that I'm able to do this\nBut I I have no expectation that oh you know I'm American books such dinner else of course not right that's that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense\nBut do you see that a lot of these other big journal ties that that some of these big outlet they really think oh my gosh without us how could the republics time probably be better off that the real for that's why when Trump calls him out that's when they get so upset\nBecause again they probably would be a you know easier without some of these outlets out there I think some of them do act in\nBad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good ethos and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space\nBut it's it's such an important thing you should always feel like anyone that you see in in media anyone in journalism especially on the TV side of things\nThey should feel blessed and lucky and be always exuding a sense of thanks and gratitude to the audience that gives them their job\nAnd the moment that they lose sight of that you know that that then you turn into one of these overpaid CNN cry babies you know the moment they lose that that then you start getting this mentality you see what you know the the Acosta effect\nOf like oh I'm just I Want to ask policy questions but first I Want to ask like what the president hurts my feelings on like let me just to the story about me\nThat that's the move but someone over so nurses system is the Achilles' heel of the media Trump knows it and he keeps going after it and he should and that's why he keeps winning [noise]\n\nWait until Black Friday

the\nGateway pundits or whose name is actually escaping me right now but he\nUh well what does this guy's name again I'd never heard of him before Jacob wool a twenty year old a twenty year old far right Internet personality who has written for the gateway pundit\nUm he allegedly tried to entice a woman to claim that Muller and sexually harassed her in the most\nHam fisted stupid ridiculous [noise] kinda transparently obvious thing imaginable\nBasically was offering women money to lie about Mueller I was going to then get a report on the allegations are what I don't think he understood is that of all the people that you would\nKind of mess with right now if you you know that's I don't care who you are fake sexual assault or fake sexual harassment allegations are despicable I don't care who we are talking about\nWe don't lie about people we get them on what they did or you know what they are guilty of we never should get people anyone any you\nKnow if somebody level fake sexual harassment allegations against Hillary why I wouldn't want that that's not okay I wouldn't be okay with that right we can get around all the other crime she's committed but you don't ever\nPut fake stuff out there but this gateway pointed guy or he writes for the gateway pundit he looks like he tried to entice somebody to live by Mahler and uh that is not a bear that I Would poke let me tell

is a a writer at the Daily Caller she's the media and breaking news editor ever or whatever on the show\nThank you so much for having me buck\nAll right let's first talk ... I Know you spoke at American University so you went into the campus gauntlet recently and had to deal with all all that craziness and there was even a little bit of backlash after you spoke about before we get to that just told me a little bit about some of the the hateful rhetoric that's used against Trump in your piece\nDefinitely so I decided to take a look into this because the media has of course\nThen blaming Trump's rhetoric for the recent on scores of hate crimes including the hype on such a democratic officials and then on the anti Semitic attack on a synagogue and Pittsburgh and I thought to myself I've been covering the media for about a year and a half now\nAnd I can list ten things off the top of my head that they've set about Trump better just hateful and in some cases even violence so on this list you'll find things like\nUh Nicole walls and MSNBC saying that she wants to ring White House press secretary Sarah Sanders this neck you how to CNN guests at just yesterday saying that she believes Trump has I'm radicalized more people than ISIS which is a literal terror group that has a hundred thousand members\nUh and just the list goes on and on Rick Wilson threatened to got a panelist on CNN like a fish so my plea to the needy as if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric for insight that they need to take a look in the mirror and think about the things that you're saying as well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon to have seen in the last couple of weeks and we've been talking about it a lot on the show\nThat there's a there's kind of a refrain of deal when it comes to media that you know they basically just saying the conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat's exactly right there [laughter] they ah\nLondon I think was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side I'm On Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people and then immediately demonize people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in this country in the literal same breath\nSo these people they talk about respecting the other side and rationing down discourse and being respectful but they're often the worst offenders\nKnow told me about your foray into a into a campus speech here in the swamp area recently it go through that quite a bit of bugs\nYeah it got pretty sloppy so I spoke at American University and I was talking about due process on specifically in the air as me too and of course the Kavanaugh hearing that took place several weeks ago\nWhere he was accused of gang rape of all things and as soon as the event was announced probably within thirty minutes to an hour students started posting on social media about how they were going to try to shut down the beach they had a plan state face\nTo physically hide themselves from what I was going to say um and then after the event that group that invited me young Americans for elaborate actually denounced my talk altogether and said that I was being inflammatory by defending the content of my feet and talking about it on social media\nSo all around this was just another example of how college campuses nowadays um have no interest in listening to opposing viewpoints on and when they do have to listen to opposing points they melt down and\nAct like children and colleges just aren't a place anymore where dissent is a welcome to end where people like to challenge her own views now place where people have to be physically shielded from anything they disagree with\nAnd I got to say this is the first time I've heard of the the conservative group kind of back stabbing the conservative who's been invited on campus that that's a bit of a weird wrinkle\nYeah I certainly was not expecting at is the first I've heard of it as well on and I was definitely disappointed because\nIf these people expect conservative ideas to win out on campus and they have to be willing to defend them and just by nature at twenty to thirty students showing up to protest that they immediately back down and through the under the bus\nVery very weeks or so I got to say [laughter] but yeah I suspect conservative\nYeah expected jurors I live in a back road especially on campus about this stuff because uh you know I guess they wanted to get invited to the stigma signify party or something and you go to resume cells are everywhere else working on this week it goes in your sides obviously the election but what else are we going to be seen you write about at the core", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "01"}
