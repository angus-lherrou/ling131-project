topic they play last doctor ... and the\nGallery furniture mated America studios\nRadio station\nBy his man I'm Lisa ... Fox News President Trump continues to defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at a rally in Tennessee huh is the map of board has\nSo You're welcome to weigh on in on this end anytime and joining the conversation now today\nToday we had a the Monday after all the Sunday shows\nAnd I look forward to ah what happens on the Sunday shows because we can get a couple of things in our minds if you watch the Sunday talk shows meaning meet the press and ABC's This week and Fox News Sunday and even the thing over and CBS that nobody watches and Jake Tapper\nYou can kind of get an idea what the talking points are from both sides of the pile\nAnd yesterday Lindsey Graham was doing ... duty getting out there making what I Would consider a primary ... case against the Democrats and exposing what they have done the despicable approach they took on trying to block judge Kavanaugh at all costs\nSo I'm a I'm Amazed amazed at what I saw I Lindsey Graham just lifted my heart last week when he made that statement saying what a weasel the Democratic side of the Iowa it turned into and how they treated judge Kavanaugh\nAnd if you watched the Sunday talk shows\nI was going to say that was the greatest episode of meet the press ever do not know if anybody will get the joke yesterday was the single best episode of meet the press that I have ever seen no nobody well it wasn't on last week because uh\nThe Ryder Cup match the golf match preempted it\nSo that's why it was the single greatest episode ever\nBut the the terminology that has shown up\nIn the language of the left when it comes to blocking judge Kavanaugh now let's go over some of the arguments that they have a brought up to block Kavanaugh one of those arguments was well he's going to ah he's going to overturn roe overturn roe v way\nThat was the first one they said we can't have that she's going to overturn roe v way and then after the meetings\nWith judge Kavanaugh and some of the testimony it seems like you know maybe he's not\nGoing to come in with a judicial prejudice and and look to overturn roe v white so they they shifted gears and then suddenly at the end of the hearing process they came up with this accuser and the anonymous accuser that Dianne Feinstein at Santa for six weeks\nAnd so we said wait a minute we're going to question his character from thirty six years ago on we then discovered how many holes there were in the story of professor Ford and then over the weekend after the testimony and I was in DC last week I saw a buck\nOn Thursday we ran into each other to book party for a friend of ours\nI was in D.C to cover the or the hearing and the protests and then last week when they look like despite all the obstruction than deflection and and all the moves that were being made by the left\nThat judge Kavanaugh was going to push through and we would still have this week long investigation which everybody knew everybody and the dog knew that the Democrats who were going to\nComplain that week was not enough\nThey started shifting the narrative and listen to your friends listen to your friends on the left who are saying they're using the phrase the wrong temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nHe has the wrong temperament this\nIs being said by virtually every single one of the pundits it's being said by the senators the or the Congress people on the left and I'll bring it up\nAnd you will hear the parrots from the left on Facebook and Twitter bringing it up he's the wrong temperament and SNL which will get into that sent out one after Kavanaugh and ... and everyone's saying he was yelling I'm Sorry he wasn't yelling if that's what you called yelling\nYou're ignorant\nAnd let's not forget a week and a half ago when a judge Kavanaugh was interviewed on Fox News they said oh east too robotic he's he doesn't have a motion and then when it comes out in defends himself and his family he's called too emotional he doesn't have the right temperament\nThey're even now playing the card if a woman had done what judge Kavanaugh dead she'd be called hysterical and not the good hysterical you know the the crazy hysterical\nWill get into that a little bit but it got to check in with one of the ... family on the phone from Alabama Solomon checking in this evening Solomon welcome to the buck sex and show how are you\nDoing fabulous I'm Glad you're there but now a move the country fall word\nOf God Bless you thank you what what part of Alabama my friend\nWell I'm In ... and I'm a catcher your show off one point nine it's a a I have heart station out of a Biloxi\nOkay and and a Mobile Alabama is when souls or Easter Harlem house still there\nOh it is man you oughta go there with me or I care to you or when a case which was running for president you have a yard is a a local press conference right there and uh they could have held it in the uh the telephone booth\nTo thing [laughter] I understand a few\nPeople ever get to

happens in the blob still holds a blob festival every summer so if you're ever in New Jersey it's a cool thing to do All right Solomon are real quick question for you\nIf you're a betting man a week from today is there a justice Kavanaugh or not\n[noise] well I'm a I'm going to say that are the chances are that it is but I'm surprised that nobody's really mentioning anything about you know the CIA involvement in this thing\nLong history of CIA involvement nobody's mansion in any spending about Dr of Ford's fashion or car into tree under psychedelic drugs a multi several many many years ago almost [noise] ah it was almost fatal accident\nAnd no one's really looking into a two or a into her past\nOkay well I I got to dig on that 'cause I'm I'm uneducated on some of those allegations but I Will look into it\nAnd we'll get back on if I've got verification will put it out there Solomon but do me a favor go half a dozen at a windows and a wash it down with a beautiful Dixie beer and then

it's a it's part of feeling alive and she goes okay All right now\nRich or you said you're up in northern Jersey you're kind of in a mixed area there are some conservatives in that part of the state

where the minority in this state\nWell I hear Bob Menendez is in trouble I hear the senator from New Jersey who's up for re election is having a tough time do you think there's a chance he could lose

corruption\nLike to hear some some fair the scene people in office they aren't just about Greek\nWell I think the hardest thing about a politics today is any good person scared off by what we've seen with\nWith a Brett Kavanaugh and how they've taken a good man and ripped him apart over a Beijing list allegations from three and a half decades ago so why would anyone want even go through this is Lindsey Graham said doesn't make any sense\nShow me any teenager young guy college guys is very normal you know to be attracted to grow or maybe even this construed the drinking playing around\nI mean that's more to more normal and say like you know rumors about lenders and people like that are going on private aircraft and you know with children and things like that\nWhether it's true or not you know we'll probably never know\nWe will never know but let's just hope judge Kavanaugh gets a approved and then pass through to the Supreme Court thank you rich in New Jersey appreciate your quick check in in Memphis, Tennessee with Randy Randy welcome to the buck sects than show how are you\nHey\nSo ah Randy you're a guy who says I got a scary movie is it scarier than neither the living dead\nI I've got a ... a ... is just because I thought when I was probably four or five years old premature very All right and all and\nProbably nobody's heard of that one\nWell rain will land for those that don't know it was one of the ... greatest actors in America\nAnd at the end of his career he made a lot of B movies including a one with Rosie Greer retired football player where rainbow lands head got transplanted onto Roosevelt careers body\nAnd it's one of the cheesiest horror films you'll ever see\nIf you if you haven't seen it yet I'll look a premature burial but you look up I think it's called the thing with two hats and its Roosevelt Greer and regime of land and remote land also made a movie called the man with the X\nRay eyes which is another cheesy horror film so uh I think you would enjoy it [laughter]\nAs I was only on my list because I saw it as a child but I get a real one is and have them\nFantastically good one but I mean I yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I still go for the the kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes up\nA [laughter]\nWell good good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks for listening to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got a just what was it six weeks left before the midterms way of work to do we have to make sure everybody we know it gets out and boats\nAre checking in I have time it gets to check in with John in Delaware has the thought about a scary movie and Chuck Schumer John welcome to the program\nAnd Mike welcome back to Delaware you always seem to be in Delaware and when I'm listening to highlight that\nWell I live in Delaware\nOh do ya okay great man okay cool anywhere near Dover where you at northern Delaware\nAh yeah yeah up in ah Newcastle county and I mentioned it earlier uh I\nEnjoy time on the Delaware Bay when I can but yeah my wife and I lived in Delaware and the ... you live in lower slower Delaware where people have their brains and they're still conservative so I'm up in the blue part of his essay at\nThat but once you get down into the robots area it starts turning a little bit\nYeah it ... role but there's a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk or the Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right ... well I wanted to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nYeah there's a lot at the shining is currently leading in all voting and it's a it's a great movie behind\nYou guys I just now started the show believe it or not I'm On the radio and and there's ... show just started about ... minutes to go around that\nOh cool well in our\nOwn you guys so I'm just now catching I thought this show just started ... and\nKnow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining is ethic\nIt it well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny\nWe thought that Nicholson's character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic characters shift you have to like the guy first he was weird for me to\nYou did actually he came off a little bit scary or maybe a little bit psychologically unstable and is that am I correct\nYeah yeah so here here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but uh I'd ask John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer 'cause I'm no fan of him or he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and they always seem to be robbing the salt into wearing what he said today about the judge Barry said that he was you know deeply deeply part is saying and it's funny as\nThis cat or didn't notice judge from a carrot eight Chuck Schumer got a big mouth\nAnd if we don't get our little boat and we don't you know get out there for the mid term that make things right\nAnd keep things the way if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're gonna have to hear his mouth for the next God only knows how long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are my\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the head\nYeah these are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy ... nomination it is disgusting I'll get into some of that I still didn't get to my network

his exploits and appreciate you being there every time I'm here filling in for thank you very much my friends\nOr a ... a lot going on I Want to bring something up I was talking about uh just before the break\nI was talking about one of the sponsors of this program ... and it's a company that has a new social media platform and I think it's really important especially when we see what's going on on social media it's been weeks now\nThat one of the brighter people on social media who happens to be a conservative has been silent some talking about James Woods\nJames Woods has over a million followers and Twitter has told him he cannot come back on line\nUnless she removes something he posted he posted a comedic me him\nAnd he even said this basically as a joke but they told them unless he deletes it he's not allowed back on the format and I thought wow this is a publicly traded company and and\nThen I thought well maybe just maybe they're out there making sure that\nThey apply the same kinds of standards and principles to everybody who's on Twitter and I looked at and I saw the horrific thing the Rosie o'donald posted after\nLindsey Graham went after the Democrats and the Judiciary Committee and called them out for what they were doing how they were destroying judge Kavanaugh and how they were actually make it impossible for anyone to want to be\nWell a Supreme Court justice God Knows what else will be affected by this attack on a good man but Rosie o'donald tweezers out\nAnd I have to um have to delete some of the things she said 'cause they can't say I'm On the radio she said F. you you closeted idiot\nThis is the patriarchy exposed this is reality deal with it no Kavanaugh's confirmation not my president well Rosie O'Donnell\nThat out there and went after Lindsey Graham\nAnd she's basically here's a gay woman who's making an allegation that Lindsey Graham is a closeted homosexual how is that allowed how is that not considered hate speech how does that not considered to be over the line by the gods of Twitter\nHow Twitter how explain I guess if you're a liberal you can say just about anything\nI guess if you're a person on the other side of the aisle it's okay to smear somebody for example a Bill Maher or did the same thing Bill Maher on his show this past weekend after Lindsey Graham gave his fiery speech supporting judge Kavanaugh\nThis was on television this weekend and appeared all over Twitter\nYou know what your bad is this process of buying [noise] I mean the fact that from can either find people like him or make him ... ... ... am right strain was stabilizing influence as the boyfriend because he is [noise]\nNow bill Marr has smeared Lindsey Graham and he is also smeared John McCain all in in Seventeen Seconds on his show\nHow is this a loud and don't even get me started on what senator now why did attacking Kavanaugh\nSaturday Night live attacking Kavanaugh and Graham and the entire process is all about any means necessary to tear down this nominee\nBut I don't understand how one social media platform is allowed to single handedly silence conservative it's I've been shadow band if I put a post on my Twitter account at stumped for and if you will\nAnd I include a reference to a gun or a firearm\nIt is uniformly relegated to the ash sheet of Twitter shadow banning I'm shoved off into the abyss and not given the opportunity to let my audience read it\nBut if I take out the word gun or a firearm\nAnd put in something like banana\nInstantly it's available to everybody\nI Know it sounds paranoid but it it's true so how is this a loud houses even allowed to happen\nWell I think we've lost their minds we have given every opportunity to be offensive to the left and zero to be offensive from the right\nAnd maybe it's time we all stood up and looked at some of our folks and there are alternatives to these other social media platforms\nI'm just saying oh I don't get me started on\nCathy Griffin Kathy Griffin also went after Lindsey Graham and called Lindsey Graham ms Lindsey Graham and John Lennon overt CNN additionally said that Lindsey Graham had the vapors something usually attributed to a woman in the south\nSo Don Lemon Kathy Griffin Rosie O'Donnell and Bill Maher you can all make jokes that impugn a man's heterosexuality or mark a man and yet you are the people living in the universe\nIt seems like the people in the universe might get a little upset too but I guess not I guess this is about any means necessary and I just don't understand it or maybe I'll get a quick um movie here a time in New Haven Connecticut Welcome to the buck sex and show you had a scary movie for me\nYes I did a Halloween knowing much\nDo you know that's a really good point that it's a baby
