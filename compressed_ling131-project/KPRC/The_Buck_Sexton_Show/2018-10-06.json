the\nPlan your best is good enough and your perfect to win the game you just have to be your\nBest and in this particular game well with every game but certainly it in specific this gang everybody's watching every every single player bodies but there's gotta be half the stadium get very excited\nAnd half not as excited it'll flip flop the way that goes that's just the way this game is structured and you guys to be able to play into that constant din that's going on in the end and I worry about those kinds of things\nYeah it was weird usually\nYou know we do crowd noise that practice when when the often says is out there or not when the defenses and\nUm you know this week it's been crowd noise all time because it's it's going to be loud regardless of who has the ball and so uh it's a unique environment and in one that uh like you said in the human nature is going to be\nA you know when they make a player we make a poor one it's going to be all of the sky is falling cars are crowds going crazy and you know when we make a play\nIt's gonna be you know all we're on top of the world you know and so that the you've got to manage playing in between those those two emotions and and truly playing the next play a game like this is being even keel as difficult as close as they get where we were really really difficult but um I I think\nYou know we're doing a good job of it so far I knew this game is a little bit more intense than some but uh I I think our guys or will be ready for\nOkay we'll be all on the air at ten o'clock Saturday morning with the kick off at a weapon Texas and Oklahoma in the red river showdown we'll look forward to seeing the bowling Dallas red coach government\n\nHorn weekly with Tom ... has been brought to you by authors wing bar if you don't like our wings we'll give you the bird university coauthor with the largest selection of longhorns merchandise university to dock job by windstar world casino resorts it's always a good time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's going to continue in his role or Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this\nAll of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of this resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats\nIt said when you go out and develop all of your missions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth\nThis year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nFish has time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks four and a half months to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews if you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's\nTalking about Merrick Garland he was talking about Hillary's loss or I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring because the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered\nToday they sounded like a bunch of people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great now I I'd like to say this is a a\nA good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity it's an absolute eternity\nSo I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interest of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens\nWhen you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms history tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous question for you I Know the other day I asked\nA question about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAnd ah if you missed it to what you might have been working I Know people have jobs to do\nOr the address was remarkable\nAnd you could go so many different directions with it or I should give you what a what they say in the biz as the money shot the big finish at the end of this here was the last minute of Susan Collins\nMr President\nWe've heard a lot of charges and counter charges at that judge Kavanaugh\nBut as those who have known him that had that test that he has than an exemplary public surfing jazz teacher coats husbands\nDespite turbulent\nBitter fight surrounding his nomination my first and how is that Brett Kavanaugh will work\nLess than that ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer fight for just says and and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restart\nMr President I Will vote chicken for jazz cats [noise] [noise]\nAnd then there was a massive round of applause for very long round of applause in the Senate\nIt was a very emotional day and I'm sure it was very emotional for people\nOn the other side and you know it's an interesting immediately following the announcement of Susan Collins we had Joe mansion running running to hand the\nPress his statement that he is in fact going to also [laughter] I it's almost\nToo funny and then you hear this morning mansion called the White House early in the morning\nAnd said that well if a if Susan Collins votes I'm going to vote for him to some you know that that's a good thing right Mr President you won't come and do any more rallies in West Virginia against me because he's trying to retain his seat in a state that Donald Trump won handily in twenty sixteen\nA very very red state that if a Joe mansion did not support this nomination he would probably have a tough time so I'm sure there were some political horse trading there are kind of like the or\nThe brass got the corn husk or compromise that rock Obama used to get Obamacare across the finish line there's so much more to get to I Will give you a couple of other seminal moments from\nToday and also the protesters aren't done yet the protesters who are funded by some pretty big people yeah I'm going to throw the Soros name out there\nAre because one of the women who yelled at Jeff Flake last week a woman who got into the elevator and was screaming get Jeff Flake\nGet too she works for yeah she works for a nonprofit social justice organization that has been funded to the tune of millions of dollars by one George Soros and CNN gave her I think in uninterrupted five minutes of their time today\nTo spell her guts and sell her story I'm Sorry we have to take the mascot these people and point out that this is a well crafted attack on our way of life and our government will get into it but joined the conversation\nYou know the number eight for for nine hundred bucket for for nine hundred to eight to five and the buck Sexton show [noise]\nOh six seven hundred three eight oh two oh six six it's been Twenty years I've been sending people to them that I've been sending people to them if you're buying a home I like um

Michael ... the godfather sitting in for my friend bucks Sexton and are enjoying the heck out of this place this audience Happy Friday you made it pat yourself on the back\nNot only did you make it but I think reason and logic and\n[noise] the system worked and it it didn't work really well because the only one Democrat out of forty nine Democrats is voting to confirm\nJudge Kavanaugh to elevate him to justice Kavanaugh only one out of forty nine\nThat's not a good thing that really is not a good thing but there is good news on a new poll out of Fox that says ah the things that are most important to people in the midterms the number one thing\nIs uh the economy now number two is health care and if you paid attention today to Susan Collins or yesterday if you've been listening to\nPresident Trump in his speeches at these campaign rallies\nHe is brought up specifically\nHow he wants to make sure the pre existing conditions are protected\nSo with the number one issue being the economy and the number to issue being health care the president a well he's already addressed the economy with the economy the economy's working it's bought off right now three point seven percent unemployment\nThe lowest since Nineteen sixty nine and companies\nAre now are actually working to more people who left the employment world to come back to work they're trying to come up with new ways to get\nSome of the women who left to go have families to come back to work there are trying to get people to fill jobs in the manufacturing sector\nTo come back to work there are\nThousands upon thousands of good jobs in both manufacturing and then the trades that are on filled all you have to do is listen to what\nMike Rowe talks about if you don't follow Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit Mike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe works all one\nWord you're missing out if you would like to have a career that you probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally\nTens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nThey are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you\nHow you can uh get a skill and then go to work in my puts out scholarships for stuff like that so uh check that I didn't mean to get off track all also the\nFifth number one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms to fifth thing guns\nBecause Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal and Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people\nWho are a kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime enter a member I'm a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm a believer in\nGetting trained and being sure you\nKnow how to operate your firearms and keep them safe but I also understand there are people who are ... another bonus word of the day today hop a phobia you don't want to ... ... someone who when they hear the word gun\nThey immediately lose it on the little sister who hears the word gun\nAnd instantly her blood pressure goes up I could buy a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he's going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bump stocks than a I'm Sorry but um if there if it's illegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting that law\nAnd I think we could win points with some of those uh ... folks if we would say bump stocks aren't a good thing if you disagree with me convinced me that's just one of those things that this gun owner descent or a member is in lockstep with the president or\nSo ... that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a\nMine perimeter around your homes title the instant they

whose main used to be part of Massachusetts but that was one of the greatest duration try for it and I'm just real happy and that's all I can say\nDid you watch the whole thing yeah I watched it\nYeah I did you hear me talking about how I didn't see it first I listened to it on the radio and then I watched it later I was more impressed after it\nWhen I watch the because I realized this GOP is finally starting to get his presentation act together you know the two women in the background the whole set up was just perfect\nWell you sound like an old Yankee Republican uh that's what a what do you know in the past you know she she has been [noise] you know confusing but I mean today I got to give her credit I mean got Russia just beautiful\nYeah I think she laid out a primary fishy case and why this guy deserved to be where he's going to be hopefully after tomorrow and why\nAll of the ... and hollering while it should not be listened to as a legitimate criminal charges but she also brought up I thought I really respectful case for the victim the alleged victim here not a victim of judge Kavanaugh but of somebody\nI I was showing Presley and and I'm not usually as Susan Collins fan so that's a good now did you have a bad jingle to share with us\nOf course I Do I used to be the spaghetti ocean or commercial which one you're going to go way back for that that's a neat round spaghetti you can eat with is full of spaghetti owes\nOh I I remember just oh spaghetti has but now you reminded me than ... rounds spaghetti you can do with a spoon\nA spaghetti owes [laughter] now\nYou're in Quincy mass and there's a lot of good Italian food and Massachusetts did your family ever ... have spaghetti os\n[laughter] I Know you get out and\nWe were not allowed to have spaghetti and a cat and my mother's like you're not eating spaghetti out of it can that's a good one lady I'm putting that down spaghetti of jangle thank you happy weekend thanks for checking in John in Pennsylvania are also wants to give Susan Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how're you doing I'm gonna I yeah I Wonder I Wonder if say that I think one of the reasons why there's ... to go on to your bowl is because it's a speaking truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump are so popular people because\nWe're so used to all these politicians just here say ... or something else you know never falling off all sounds good come up to a lecture butler somebody actually scripture in our heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare event\nAnd I think she tapped into that raised\nBy you know ... some of the consistency these people look at the television and they're just like you know why or why would suddenly ... why would you go back to a party you know ten times reader people will be drug ... stuff that anybody would an ounce of comments parents\nJust have to say you know this is and the one thing I could face the media is so close to it and I hope these people never get a new power look everybody goes that votes don't you go that these people voted out the media it'll it'll drive you crazy [laughter]\nI agree [laughter] it's a great point any jingle you want to share with us in bad jingle that haunts you\nIn a yeah when you just said that that other guy I was sick and will ... head which could have been that good stuff I guess I don't think it's around anymore it's just it's butter but it's not it ...\nOh my God if you think is ... by it but it's not a long term memories somewhere I say oh\nThat's a good bad one thank you that's an earworm that's in my head now to have a great weekend sir I appreciate you Michael Palca infer ... than just around the corner and we're going to check in with match lap match wife works in the White House I've known ... for years from the pack and the American Conservative Union\nHe is a good conservative guy he says Trump guy died in the wall and he makes a lot of sense will hang out with Matt\nWe'll talk about today maybe we'll talk jingles next on the bus Sexton show\nMike what at night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShoot a great job should a great job look I'm sitting here with my wonderful wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and\nI was telling her I feel your article here and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer I Can't imagine what it feels like for the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the rigors were very emotional and very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward not just for the party not just for the president not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one and the guy had we not going forward and I know we're not done yet\nI Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours\nBut it's pretty much a fait accompli isn't not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process uh I Do think that um\n[noise] America has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might put the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so hate filled and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the stain\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family I think those folks need to find\nA way to recapture their party because it's quite as we when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm fearful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case every battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with but I Am\nNervous that this victory happen too quickly too soon because we've gone for weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue in the election and\nUnderstand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm goes but we have to think about this if we as a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country until the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of shared that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where my heart just can't stand for something that I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud and Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it granted Fox's your they're given a big huge hug and I've been a real critic of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never Trump per se and have come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promised that they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional is a Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and conservatives\nMost that coalition are conservatives I think that there's great promise now more problems than I felt a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap or I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also\nAll over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you want to tell me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together when we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell's doing kept those centers together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct\nHe just around it credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that is ... you know not done yet a tomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee ticket shepherd shepherded through the Senate\nAnd under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was just way to get the next book is an excellent could be replacing a liberal\nAnd a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so it was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick up Zell Miller's autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question\nYou'll have like five daughters un mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters have to actually write\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls one is a sophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all fuel silver lined by the ah\nBy the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable a talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I've talked to my eighth grader and I talk to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also uh\nPutting that on the list that goes right with spaghetti us and if you think it's butter but it's not as fun I'm a pepper Europe pepper\nYeah that was a horrible one thank you Dr I'll see you somewhere in the region you never know where all turn up in Baltimore Michael falcon in for my buddy ... and join the

come and do you live from that constitutionally protected\nFree speech bunker in the woods of Delaware yeah I'm right here in the middle of the blue part of our state trying to make sure free speech freedom libertarianism and capitalism\nAre going to thrive not just survive thrive we're talking about the day\nWe're talking about Susan Collins is speech that Lindsey Graham even said while Lindsey Graham I we talked if you hear half an hour ago we're talking with match slap to the American Conservative Union\nOr you know Matt he's the white haired guy you see on Fox and even on MSNBC or and and we're talking about the fact that months ago if you would have said Mitch McConnell Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham would be the three stars of the G O P we'd all go get out of here go home you're drunk\nBut there we are and we're talking to you guys about today and we're also talking about horrible jingles because I'm trying to get some of the horrible jingles on my head and we've\nBeen reminded of some of the old ones like uh oh spaghetti O's and if you think it's butter but it's not\nIt's shift on Georgian Pennsylvania is checking in George tests due to my friend\nMy great great ... here\nOh thank you I you know what can I go way way way back to the early days of the blaze and now that we're both\nAre no longer at the blaze but this show is still on the blaze radio it's kinda cool you know it's kind of cool for us to all be together again so I'm really thankful for the opportunity what's in your mind tonight\nI hate the way we let the Democrats set the tone of this this they tried to turn it into his ideas are radical are or not radical wrong he's got bad ideas he's got that he is\nYou have to worry about how his upbringing and all that kind of stuff he's an originalist\nAn originalist follow the law in Turkey interprets the law the way it was written which was the whole idea of having along the first place when you have judges on doing that and rewriting law what you end up with because you end up with a committee\n... at a dictatorship that dictatorship by committee but it's still a dictatorship they are making all new laws they're making who writes they're re interpreting the light which in a in a totally totally devoid of were originally started\nAnd we kinda weak they're going to be hammering on this we've got a week to turn this around and try to explain what an original list it does as a judge and the fact that it's exactly what the constitution designed was designed for\n... ... ... George or a hundred percent correct and part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves but Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media\nDana and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it we don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished what was it three weeks ago with constitution week\nAnd I guarantee it the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution and ah I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws or reinterpret the laws uh I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed at a record rate and I think what's happened\nThere not just mad at Kavanaugh I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and went\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so that\nYou just do the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court\nI well I'm In the basketball court right there but they were there were designed to view the referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there\nThinking about life insurance what

become a Supreme Court justice before the weekend is over or it's going to\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nDoes that sound like people capable of independence thought and and do what you're thinking now that was an isolated case no just a few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too [noise]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters a really strange church of protesters and I think\nThese lost boys and mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions\nAnd it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the uh same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nHow do you ... you find out how ...\nI Will be\nI Will be voting yes\nOn the head that final confirmation vote and ... show signs of how to vote later today\nThat was Susan Collins earlier today before she delivered that ethic address tonight\nWho just some magical day and again I I go back to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes\nThe salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're out of your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly how\nThis worked out Susan Collins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet\nOf what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she gave a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady decline for more than Thirty years why can only hope that the cabin a nomination it's where the press sets had finally hit\nAgainst this backdrop sat each individual senator to decide what the constitution said fights and consent Judy ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice\nWhich means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative to liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd be Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them\nSo uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today and their argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something here fused of doing something\nIn this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is all over for America as a as a civil society\nPrints venison since relevant to the advice and consent function when and if the accusation kept her\nFrom a nominee otherwise except blurry wreck I worry that part in it but it's ... cents and could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process\nMoving forward some of the allegations levied against jets cabinet illustrate why it hurts that innocence is so important\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations sprayed by professor for but if the allegations that plenty what's the nature jets cabinet Toronto multiple girls\nAnd use their we can stay kept that sound like a gang rape\nYou know what's the most amazing here is it when you think about it\nThe apple ... behavior of Democrats ultimately helped confirm judge Kavanaugh and most importantly the absolute insane charges brought by Michael ... not he\nThe guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his delusional dreams of being a twenty twenty presidential candidate ... brain for these insane charges that were debunked within twenty four hours but still repeated by the mainstream media\nHave a Ninety may have driven Susan Collins to make this choice she talked about this this wild delegation\nOut last ditch alec gauge what's put forth without any credit supporting\nEvidence and simply parachuted public statements stepfather\nYeah she's talking about the media she didn't go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well reasoned well crafted\nAnd cogent argument for judge Kavanaugh by saying that what was brought up about him was totally\nThat's according to an arrest report see he ended up getting arrested and he's now suing Walt Disney parks and resorts for more than Fifteen thousand over the incident which happened in twenty Fifteen he claims he was falsely accused the battering wrongfully arrested\nAccording to the lawsuit\nHe claims he was willing to accommodate the request to move but was asked\nA for a brief delay so the rest of
