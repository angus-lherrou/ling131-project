give you my thoughts on ... after this has done it Chris go ahead and play that go ahead and play a little this is a little clip of ... in the oval office sitting in front of Donald Trump\nSaturday Night live to prove all the levels are a lot of heat on we don't let\nThat veto by the\nWay the factory and we\nBar for three and power we are suffering job to America [laughter]\nEntertainment I here but when we make everything that China and not America were cheating on our country we're putting people in for a legal thing she factory out\nAll right well we're going to come back to that in a minute\nThis was this is ah about to play a little CNN panel this was a pretty common sentiment among the media today and well just just listen to what they had to say about Kanye West\nKayaking is what happens when they grow don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with them and take pictures [laughter]\nFlick it I've got ... got this all\nThat was a yeah it was done lemon show on CNN let's unpack this for a quick second here too says why need at least two or three hours because I have a lot to talk about for what Kanye West for those view white guys that are older than fifty like I could just see my dad right now looking at\nThe radio like who who's gone yeah why is it what it was he in Led Zeppelin or something like my dad had no idea he's a rapper okay he's a famous rap\nKanye West is a crazy person\nOr a ... west has been a crazy person I mean I'm not I don't know if he's clinically insane but he's he's out there he's one of these artists these ... there was always saying outlandish things and so I don't care as sitting at the ... what he says\nAbout Trump or to drop I wouldn't care if he was trashing Trump I don't care these praising Trump I don't care the celebrity opinions\nMean nothing to me I just not one of those people and I understand that does make me a minority\nPeople love to find somebody to latch onto\nAnd worship really it's kind of how God made us were made to worship somebody but I just don't do it with people I just can't do that because he's not my thing but that being said\nI admired guts I've always admired people doing the hard thing swimming against the tide saying things that\nPeople all around them tell them they're not allowed to say doing that has gotten me in lots of trouble in my life but I'm Glad I Do it and I'm never going to stop I like\nThat he's in an industry that is universally Republicans are the Democrats are great and Kanye West as oh no not really\nAnd he said I'm not going to let them bully me they're all trying to bully me I'm not going to let him do it\nIn that CNN whip\nTelling him what what's the what did he say is what they call them Chris house negro\nMan that's ugly that's that's that's\nUgly what is it eighty Arctic sting to say about somebody he's not allowed to have a different opinion gotta whipping back on in in line there\nIt's disgusting it's disgusting to me people were not\nMonolithic for whatever their religion or skin color is what black people were not all the ...\nThe only thing it's all the same about white people as we can't dance\nSkin colors that people are their own individual and you have every right to feel however the heck you want to feel without some jerk tone you a house negro and John Lehman sitting there kept wing like an idiot\nIt's gross\nSo no I didn't really care what town you said whether he is whether he approves of Trump or not but then I see these talking heads out there putting him down with that lobster in the bucket\nMentality and I hated it ticks me off a guy can say whatever he wants fine\nFine\nBut I hate\nThat he's not allowed to be different in good for him for being different now that being said\nWe need to be careful who we latch onto\nAs conservatives it's okay to be happy for a minute and think finally some celebrity is not trashing us because it is it does matter that we've lost an entire part of the culture it's not unimportant\nYou take your kids to the movies you go to the movies yourself you never really get conservative messaging coming back at you unless it's you know a military film but they haven't watered down you just never really get that coming back at you\nYou get that a woman here me roar propaganda crap you get all that crap\nIt's not great it's not healthy for music either but you never get any of the appropriate messaging coming back you\nForty percent of liberal arts colleges do not have a single Republican on the faculty according to Jordan Peterson at ... healthy to have one part of the culture that we've completely lost because that stuff is influential so it's nice I won't deny the fact that is nice\nBut just be careful be careful who you hit your wagging to especially with its musician right musicians are crazy people anyway\nI'm now I'm getting the thirty seconds signed I was just rolling Chris I was just getting rolling [noise] if you have a compliment you'd like to give me you can write me Jesse I Am just ... dot com [noise] if you have a criticism makes you use then that email to Chris [noise]\nI was wonderful today Chris was I guess above average except for his rage against the machine gap [noise]\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower were spot in trouble before it happened well now it's not enough to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's why parents pressed blink blinked video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home it's like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up and mix and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brand technology\nFrom a gallery British roommate did America studio\n\n\nOf destruction ... Fox News this storm is gone to clean up\nOn your way in the Florida Panhandle one day after hurricane Michael made landfall Fox is the path of port\nUh you know we we shouldn't get too enamored with the notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ... so friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way you know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations\nAre we allowed to embrace that he's\nThings that we like and pushing ideas that we liked now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even ten years ago whatever was he had a different perspective so with that in validates him now that's not a standard that we hold any once you've never mind to a celebrity so\nBut there is a little bit of I don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there's some applause with caution here I think in order for the whole Conyers situation\nAnd then there's also the everybody just needs to calm the hack down our meeting was acting like\nTrump went and play Eighteen holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some crazy thing that he had\n... talk to them and say oh he's profane the uh profane the\nOffice of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office literally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff than have a guest who cursed\nBut there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find ways to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that here's a perfect example of what I'm Talking about\nJohn of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in CNN and who was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donald Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get a buck slapped if you will\n... or ... ... you know what I mean fuck yet bucks left\nUm and\nIn turn I actually managed to turn the tables on her and she told me she interrupted be once and told me to stop interrupting her it was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that but I was never impressed with her so she was treated out\nAnd she is treated out the following in response to this kind of member this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following in response to this whole commenting today\nKanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years wish Sojourner Truth could have met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap\nBut let's meet ... an election day by voting for Democrats I mean the the end of that is fine but she wants to propagandize for Democrats you totally free to do that but just say the ... has set back\nUh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community set us back a hundred and fifty five years well this one does the math on that\nIt seems uh like she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say here you have a\nWorld famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the ... literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world\nThis is a man talking about Trump now is Tanya probably thinks he's the leader of the free world\nAmong other things among being a deity ah but there's no ... there's no way\nAny ... normal human being could look at this and so yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans I mean this is this the oval office and I think that the way they get to this is two fold one today they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also\nThey don't really accept the Trump is the president they they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions and the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is a ... interlopers he's a pretend or to the throne if you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give a present he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself\nAnd so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDiluted with with rage or not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report\nIs demeaning but to any normal person that's just crazy it's just crazy that is the most accurate way\nTo describe it and there were some meltdowns today there was a meltdown that were incredible I mean ethic meltdowns where is\nThat John do we have that MSNB ... oh my God\nVal she and ... and rule who are this duo and MSNBC that I've seen a few times now\nIs they went into Pearl clutching level ten over this thing you know what let's let me let me take a moment your team a for for nine hundred to eight to five eight four four nine hundred bucks you want to share some thoughts on the kind of situation call him will get lines open now\nUh but when when we come back you will have to hear this

... George Clooney everybody met with Obama\nAll the time yeah and and we would act and we hear those clown spouting off some of them get very involved in politics actually but you know this is where you see the Trump to arrangements syndrome on display you know the same way that\nWhen Obama would play golf the media would say that it was you know that he that he was so smooth and slick and cool and chill and doing this world during the world's business while he's playing Eighteen holes and you don't come with world leaders from his phone\nBut when Bush played golf would you stop doing it on a level when Bush would play golf it was like oh my gosh look at him\nWhite male privilege on display doesn't even care about the country in the sacrifices that are going on by our troops overseas and you know when you did actually get rid of Gulf because of that but\nYou know they really would pile on Bush or because for him to play golf was it was that he was an an serious still a challenge and the role when Obama played golf it was charming\nYou know it was evidence of his of his skill and south welfare under pressure or whatever same thing with the celebrity meets Obama went on Zach Galifianakis is between the two ferns show ... is not even funny\nObama went on the mark from Aaron ... gas in Obama went on you know which I I Know has a big audience but I'm just saying you know this is it's not like presidents in the ... and the recent past the most recent president didn't do things that he goes and the Tonight Show and all this stuff happens\nUm\nSo I Am seeing however ... this is just broken media I don't know if you can see anything oh yeah might give me the list of Obama visits let's go for\nThe here's feel one way about John Legend queen ... Stevie Wonder usher Aretha Franklin uh\nGot school down 'cause it was just so long a county Britain or interest Elba Jay Z Jennifer Hudson Jill Scott Mary J ... and the judge Oprah Winfrey Smokey Robinson it goes on and on okay everybody basically like\nIf you're famous and you want to see Obama you could\nAnd that was that was never held against him in fact they really liked that Obama was the celebrity President Trump is a celebrity president to\nShow you know we're going to be honest here\nBut Obama being a celebrity president was considered to have cache was cool that he was a celebrity President Trump in his lab the president is he's a buffoon a clown he's on serious\nHe's you know a bad guy all that stuff is just where you see the the separation\nIs where you see how the media doesn't treat same things the same way and it's all based on their perception of the individual which is based on you know this this political polarization that has now taking over everything around us but I just thought that bell she enroll\nFreak out was pretty incredible yeah okay so ... just hanging out with Trump he said some pretty\nPretty outlandish things who cares it ... it doesn't mean anything it's interesting and here's a guy who you know and not another part of this that I Will say I find I Do find distressing\nIs that you've had a lot of media people saying that well we can't take ... seriously because because he's mentally ill\nI think that's really disgusting thing to do\nJust because ... had shot mental health treatment at one point it does not mean that he does not get to have a voice you'll be taken seriously the rest of the rest of his life in fact that's a terrible message to seven and a lot of people you know I Know people who are incredibly successful\nWho have had real mental health struggles and we want people to always go they'd be like saying oh you've got a terrible infection and your legs don't go see a doctor right that's that would be crazy same thing for a bit of a mental health problem so to stigmatize in that way and say ... because you sought treatment for I think it was bipolar disorder but I don't remember\n'em then we can't take any of these ideas now it's yours you that's disgusting things to say in a lot of big media people have been saying\nA and a lot of networks have been saying they've been psychiatric we diagnosing Kanye from afar which is also unethical and really unfair\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that\nThere is a concern right now I mean what I heard does not sound like someone [noise]\nUh coming clearly to talk to the president's about issues that are\nThat are in the black community when it comes to issues of Kanye West bringing black people to a President Trump that is that's a misnomer a kind of a way to made a large portion of the African American community upset about his comments about race or about his comments about slavery so uh at this point Kanye West um\nHe's exposing himself more and more in the highest office in the land this is not just a moment on TMZ this is not just a moment in a on the line with us being the car dashes whatever that show is this for the world to see the world thought Kanye West end the raw reality TV show we were watching I mean there was\nYeah we can you can use John too I mean give me a favor just play the beginning of that one more just just the first couple of us wanna make sure everyone here is actually starts us off\nThere is a concern right now I mean what I heard does not sound like someone [noise] uh coming clearly to talk to the president about issues that are that are in the black community when it comes to\nOkay so\n... clearly you know she's she's also when there's a very serious in her analysis of all this but you do have these these groups these uh these different panels on TV who go on there and they will discuss specifically the county well a Kanye West was\n... you know in in ... in a place where you had to go seek mental health treatment\nYou know they'll say that oh he's crazy essentially for a prominent what they're saying this is what they're saying for a plumber prominent black celebrity in America to embrace Trump and ... and believe in this movement\nIs evidence of being crazy or is only possible if you are crazy that's what they're saying\nAnd I don't think that they know who the crazy one really is but that's what they are telling you\nI Can't help but notice that one of the of favorite tactics of the Soviet Union that continued on even into the Newton era for dealing with the most hated political critics of the regime you don't just want to lock up a political credit card you don't want to lock up dissidents\nAnd they become heroes they become martyrs if you kill them\nBut what if you can get them committed to a psychiatric facility what if somebody who criticizes the government can be declared insane by the state and committed to be with other crazy truly crazy people in sub par you know horrific conditions in\nThe interior of Russia or in Siberia that's what they used to do they still do it there are allegations they still do it at least in Russia\nIf you are too much of a thorn in administration side I guess in the regime side or they will have you committed they've done it before they ... they tried to do to journalists by the\nWay as well they have not yet to my knowledge kidnapped chopped up and uh\nAnd kill the journalist in a conflict of a foreign country but we'll talk about that we'll talk about the show the issue in third our today I'm going to spend some real time on that once you because it's a big deal it's a big deal raised some very interesting questions for us and we're talking Saudi Arabia you're talking about something that\nDoes have an effect on the economy and and is not it it's not possible to just coordinate often pretend like it's not there but back to what they're saying oh you're here here's the better and so you had a variety there she obviously he's very opposed to Conyers saying this stuff and he's not addressing the concerns of the black community I\nAlso just think it's such a\nIt's always taken for granted that that the black community views politics from this perspective from this completely United and singular perspective and know group of people I mean there are\nI think the black community is rough it's about eleven or twelve percent of the country I think right now if you're talking about let's call thirty to forty million Americans are black thirty forty million Americans are black I'm sure you know ...\nIt's it's the size of a it's a good sized country just on its own the black community this country there are so many ideas and so many different approaches to politics within that community but they they they pretend like there aren't a you know the the Democrats pretend like there's only one view that's allowed only one view that's acceptable\nSo April Ryan she's and she's a big hashtags resistance you know anti Trump per se and all that I get it\nBut you know this this is from last night ah this is from what what happened or this is what happened on that CNN program at the end and put this on their air and I got to tell you I'm not I'm not aware of their your producer Mike has there been an apology or attraction or anything about this\nNow I have not seen anything so a prominent black American a famous wealthy self made black American get to hang out with the president on incredibly friendly terms a lot of press for it and the night before this is what they put on CNN planning on\nI'd I don't listen I'm but I Know some of the songs um there was one that he did for his mother which I think is a a nice one I Can't remember the name of it and\nYeah I I have to stay a oh well\nThere's some songs here you can't even read out loud I'm looking at a song called ... gives me power that makes me feel like Superman like you said today that would be amazing\nDo we have that soundbite that's incredibly important we do to play that\nAll friends but it\n\nIt made me feel like Superman made of Superman\nMakes them feel like Superman a there we go\nI like it All right so that that's what I was in Kenya today or the brass were freaking out about it they they don't like him no surprise there all the rest of its uh we we're going to talk more about\nWhat's going on with the mob mentality on the left in a in a moment because here's what I'm hearing they want to move past this subject because it's actually costing them in the polls are seeing\nThe overreach on Kavanaugh and the insanity that the left has put on display for us there's a problem or enough Americans have seen this for what it is not for the mostly listen to the shows like this one hopefully actually this one\nThat there are real concerns over what this means for the matures speaking listen to the show remember you

somebody talk probably about a problem\nNot the way presidents abnormally dealt with disasters test that contrast between the voice of Jeb Bush\nAnd the voice of President Trump at the rally has to make you feel this cannot be normal they allowed us to be normal\nWe're losing our sense of who we are as Americans I kept saying over and over again the Teddy Roosevelt said the wrath of democracy will founder if people in different regions different sections different races religions think of themselves as the other and that's what's happening now and we need leadership to bring that back together I guess\nThere's a Doris Kearns Goodwin very celebrated in the presidential historian or something in the law telling us about how about that they love to do that they love to put presidential historians on TV to talk about contemporary politics I always find them\nJust say the least and what they tell us about what's going on today it's nice that\nA lot of them were usually with the research stuff to help them get put together an eight hundred page book the generally people don't read but I don't really need to hear their take out everything going on now because I've written a book about a president from you know Eighteen Seventy I don't really think that that makes them some kind of\nParticular voice of of insider expertise on what's going on today\nBut notice all the criticism there was was actually of the president's tone it the way that he speaks now I don't even mean the the content of the speech I mean his the level of his speech and and the sound of his speech now that the problem she's saying Jeb Bush was calming\nYes Jeb is low energy this long since been established low energy jet\nTrump was giving a rally in Pennsylvania and you know when he talks about issues relating to to Florida is obviously very concerned is better cheap there's a big federal response\nBut this is what I mean everything that Trump does Israel but when people say things like Trump could cure cancer tomorrow and liberals we're all of a sudden be pro cancer it's true\nIt's not an exaggeration they have involve them their sense of self so much in everything that they're saying and everything that they're they're doing all the time or it has so much to do with with Trump\nThat they just can't help themselves and this is all part of the Trump delusion I mean he's\nThe response or ... will get more to their spots hurricane probably the next hour um but there's nothing that they can point you get in terms of Trump being asleep on the job or not you know I'm doing the federal aid in quite the right way or something so now it's that his tone\nHis voice cannot be the new normal\nAh ... I don't know I Can't imagine waking up every day and being such a a hysterical Pearl clutching lip I really can't it must be a very uh well I was going to say a very sad way to go through life but maybe that explains why there's all these rage mobs running around the left\nBut those mobs folks people have seen them\nAnd it's starting to show up and said at polls that's right publications getting an advantage of people are saying there is a\nOh it's not a legal process it's whatever we say it is and it's it's all about what we can convince people to do because it's it's really just a battle of rumors right or just ... ... people say things there's no evidence there's no there's nothing to do is we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the less can control\nNow impeachment is in fact\nA parallel process to the legal process that the left\nCan control if they take the house\nAnd that's what they are gearing up for so whenever we try to have the argument that\nTrump was not found guilty when it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office\nOf ... which is essentially whatever the house of representatives decides he is guilty of\nNow they can't remove him from office\nButton is the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be that President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption get rid of the uh you know the\nRacism and massage any and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say and that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments\nOn policy matters they can't meet us\nOn the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into\nA battle of reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's you know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage therapist or not and just oh he's a T don't vote for him he's picky\nWhich is really what they want to convince everybody about Trump all along but there there's a development in his whole Russia thing today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for Glenn Simpson this from the hill dot com I my own website where I work uh I don't want us to my own I obviously don't own a time employee cofounder of fusion GPS told the head of the house Judiciary Committee on Thursday\nThat his client will invoke his constitutional rights not to testify\nDepart defying ... what does that get pi him take away is pie defying a GOP issued subpoenas seeking to compel him to get a closed door deposition\nThe lawyer Joshua leddy toll judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte an electronic letter that Simpson will not participate in this committee's inquiry because it is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nQuote consistent with the September twenty seven twenty anti letter we sent you Mr Sampson who's testimony as a matter of public record will not be participating in a confidential deposition before this committee squirted lawyers for Simpson he'll be invoking his right not satisfied with the first\nAnd fifth amendments of the constitution\nAre now I understand that this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair the fitness a procedural protection and there are times when I assure you there will be people that\nYou and I are much more favorably disposed toward\nWho would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who were tied to the CIA people who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump and the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe to become public will win that the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what\nHeck is going on here you never see a great\nRevelation amount of information from this investigation supported by the people that think that Trump is done terrible things it's the people that think that Trump has been set up an ambushed year and it's weird\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just would note that they are back in office right now because one I think that Muller knows that you know to to put more kinda\nYou know Ricky ... indictments out there oh we're going to do more Russian sock puppets you know they're never going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election let me get more information but the Democrats are all in a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff and you deserve the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment\nLane here than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a potent puppet but\nI Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues at the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I really do hope and I am holding out hope that Trump declassify those Pfizer documents on the investigation origin documents that\nThat I think he should do before the election because in my opinion that could be a game changer\nIf you've ever found yourself when thing at the weak sauce taste of coffee from one of those left leaning county corporate brands\nYou probably thought yourself I Wish they spent less time on meaningless biased training bathroom a foreign policy and other things that defy common sense and more time on their coffee\nThat's why you need black rifle coffee\nI drink like rifle every day in fact it's such delicious coffee they usually I'm a guy throws a little milk and his coffee but you know with black rifle I'll just go straight black my friends and that's how I get the day started now it taste delicious this is small batch roast order coffee everyone listening to this was a

retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nAnd it's simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy and home title lock found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had it been real this thief would have taken out loans using books home is equity\nAntifa answer there is not\nThey will say things like oh the Tea Party on my ah the Tea Party involve no property destruction no threats of violence it involved a a certain aspects of a kind of historical restoration meeting people believed in you know restore the ideals of the founding\nAnd so yeah there were some tri cornered hats in some founding fathers paraphernalia but you know DC is full of that too I mean it's on our money folks right there's a lot of founding fathers paraphernalia that is whether the founding fathers\nWas anyone ever under threat at a Tea Party rally did tea partier show up at random politicians in a private moments when they were having dinner at their homes and say that they were going to follow them\nWere Republican politician saying get on their faces and oh no okay so whenever I hear this oh the Tea Party that was anger and hate it you know that was hateful they were talking about the debt and the deficit unconstitutional is and stealing from future generations now\nI Will say a legitimate criticism of the Tea Party movement although it did just deliver us the house and thank you Tea Party but a legitimate criticism of that movement is that it is that fizzled when it comes to fiscal responsibility and I do think that this was going to be a very very big problem for us and nobody wants to deal with the right now\nBecause it's just not popular nobody wants to be the one that says yeah you know what are we we can't keep spending like drunken sailor is everybody wants to be the party of all the money but anyway there is no conservative equivalent to antifa\nUm\nThere is no conservative equivalent to the calls from politicians people like Maxine Waters people uh you know people like Hirono who won't you know not only will they some of them call for getting up in people's faces which is very aggressive which is really calling for what is borderline of salt\nYou know this is like a ... when people will do things on the street where they will follow you and get up in your face and they want you to sign something and then you know the moment that I Try to step around someone and then they try to step in front of me again that's not getting aggressive now they're actually threatening my personal space right I mean you know the line between\nI Want to be verbally aggressive and I'm actually showing aggression where you have to be the fear of your safety is much murkier than a lot of Democrats want to pretend that is right now\nWhat do you even have to her Antos of the world who won't won't call it out won't shouted down they won't say you know what it is we shouldn't do this they'll just say well you know people are angry this is what people are going to do is what they want to do so\nYou know it it is what it is with that that really that is the attitude that you get from them\nOr ... you know where's the corollary so you don't have the corollary or the um\nThe analogous position on the right when it comes politicians there is no right wing version of antifa there's no right wing version of the Democrats who are saying get up and people's faces and follow them home\nThere is no right wing version of lunatic protesters who show up wearing genitalia on top of their heads and and screaming and shrieking at Senate committee hearings you know there's there's none of that we don't do that\nAnd so I think it's important to take a moment for all of a say they're this isn't a both sides thing this mob mentality the shrieking and threatening and crazy behavior [noise] this is a problem predominantly in overwhelmingly of the left\nAnd it's going to be a problem for them at the polls unless they can lie to enough Americans and act like this is a problem so we won't let that happen folks we won't let them get away with

me you know I see these people say oh Trump gets rich president [laughter]\nI'll bet you I lost billions of dollars it costs me as I said what are my friends is a very wealthy friend let's say you know how bad it cost me two or three million dollars and it's worth every penny of it [laughter] I don't need the money and it's worth every penny because I was doing so much for the country yes it's it's nasty\nIt's a vicious it's incredible the false reporting is so incredible but honestly I'm doing a great job and that's why I have these crowds these crowds are showing up of I don't do a good job they have different is\nWhen they wake up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere they getting two thousand dollars that's how a lot of money to people\nAnd I think that\nAre a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump\nAs I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more\nNow that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about Trump it's when it's at the moment we should get rid of him but they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in that position now forget about they'll say his tone is terrible he's a racist and oh my God you know bring up all the stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there was a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise trumping I I also think\nThat when we start to evaluate why is that we've had some of these was there was a couple of phenomena disease or related and and I'm just really thinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been on my mind for a while teams all share with you\nYou know you have these these never Trump or types who have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now I mean they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well of switch team or that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they\nUm they hate this president so much and that there are so many people\nWho come from ... not exclusively government backgrounds\nBut I I think come from backgrounds where they've spent time in government and their of their system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one she isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management of that other people do\nAnd ... right at that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government ... that's that's essentially the the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the the Gergen effect\nOr work for for June ... advisory more words and you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip drew it offers and\nYou know you get these guys who the whole\nTheir whole resume is this long stretch of government work and and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better then somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector in the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this I Am when really aware of it now that I'm In the swamp in\nDC they really don't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out I don't want to put this the insecurity of losers\nIn a way that is very clarifying um and I don't mean people that aren't rich you know that has nothing to do with being a loser or being a winter\nSnoopy dot com is your new

powerful it was the fastest Sarah can anybody said it just was feeding him it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left because I just spoke\nWith Governor Scott they're very happy food is paying now following hurricane being brought in a way of\nUnbelievable large amounts of water\nAnd everything that people can live on the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working on the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most part\nThey're open enough to get the electric companies and and a lot of electricity is already back on some of the false electricity has already found that's in Florida they're following up in Georgia\nSo the Trump Administration is\nShowing competence and doing what the federal government can to help respond in a situation like this obviously it was a really nasty hurricane it was a two and then it came up with category for wins we've really fast\nA but one interesting side of this and first priority at first thought of every body is getting help to those who need it and making sure that there's no or minimum loss of life and they're going to lives lost so far but as we know it can often be the aftermath where much of the damage is done in terms of the human cost\nA but hurricane Michael a hit and you're used to be this\nI guess you'd call it a gentleman's agreement a gentleman's agreement among politicians that are when something like this goes on you will you will see the political attack ad that was not the case here folks ah you had Ron descent as his rival Andrew Gillum\nGetting hit with some uh some ads you had a the the democratic superPAC that is trying to help Bill Nelson and Florida take down his opponent governor Rick Rick Scott they\nCalled them a shady millionaire and the ad by the way John I'd like to be a shady millionaire that sounds like fun you know\nBeing a millionaire would be great but a shady millionaire sounds like you're the kind of a millionaire that has parties on his yacht and had a little too much fun so I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these are these attack ads um and and people are pointing out that\nThat this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect you remember running attack at the ring attack ads in the state that is getting just battered while it was getting battered by this hurricane and they're running ads specifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians were I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics of fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were\nTrying to either batten down the hatches or ... or or wait until they can return to their homes by one of the footage of it is just the devastation I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's there is such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home what would it feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with all the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these border races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race\n'em and they're going to try to extrapolate\nFrom that for the implications for the presidential race in twenty twenty you know the idea here being Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida with the policies that he's opposing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know ... if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be\nA but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you know minority representation they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nOr identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff\nBut the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they're getting slammed by category for hurricane to take the ads or take the negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of of where that all is and uh\nI I Do believe Scott's going to pull it out but it's going guys going to make is going to make a close very close oh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you um\nAnd I just I've been waiting to have a night where you know I I'd had the time to read it and we can really dig into it together I Want to talk about this assassination of alleged assassination right now of a critic\nA Saudi national critic of Saudi Arabia is monarchy and what's going on inside the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nA crazy and brutal and just bizarre story that's coming up\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes\nMaking an online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk you're being tracked on line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile Internet provider not only can they record you're browsing history but they often salts other corporations who wants to profit from your information\nThat's one of my friends I decided to take that\nAre who were believed to be carrying Saudi diplomatic passports arrived on two private jets some of them are from NBS is personal security detail according to press reports including one who has an expertise in autopsies yeah you can imagine\nAnd that the stories that were reading right now not entirely confirmed for the stories that reading involve a brutal murder of ... I I haven't read yet how but I I Would guess they probably you know tortured and and beat him to death\nA brutal murderer and then just remembering his body putting his body parts into bags and disposing of them in fact one Mideast based paper although it's\nIt's funded by the country so it's you know take it with a grain of salt one Mideast based paper claim they have a source telling them that the body parts of ...\nSo the anti Saudi journalist that's been murder that's missing has now turned into this global story his body parts may be buried in the residents of the consul general of a Saudi Arabia in Turkey so this guy's centuries of senior Saudi\nOfficial may may have these body parts barriers backyard\nAnd this is crazy folks either this is if you read about this in a fiction novel you'd say come on\nThat so that so outrageous not only is this not if you know\nThis is not the kind of guy you can disappear\nAnd I and I want to get into a little bit of well what does that tell us about the Saudi motivations are probably the Saudis are saying what we'd expect which is of course you know they think that he left and they don't they don't they don't accept any responsibility for this and nothing happened this is all crazy conspiracy theories you know you could assume all that\nUm but and then that'll give it some of the complicating factors here but the Turks have pretty good intelligence and police forces\nAnd plenty of surveillance cameras and other ways of figure out what went on here and for the Saudis to do this on Turkish soil instead of trying to lure ... back to Saudi Arabia if he went to Saudi all bets are off we wouldn't you know he would have just disappeared and nobody would know\nSo they did this in Turkey a well keep in mind that a cause show he was a permanent resident of the U.S now he had gone into a a a self imposed a self imposed exile of sorts here in the states but that the Saudis would do this is so brazen\nAnd now you have all these different politicians get Lindsey Graham said there'll be hell to pay you know I like Lindsey now is you know hey I like Lindsey did the right thing and the Kavanaugh hearing I'm I've always been okay with Lindsey Graham but now I'm I'm pretty pro Lindsey but people are saying is going to be held to pay\nIt seems increasingly likely that the Saudis will just deny deny deny but the overwhelming weight of the evidence is that this was a a brutal\nBroad daylight you know ours assassination inside a diplomatic facility on another country's soil\nThis is the kind of stuff that that you do cut off\nYou know relations with a foreign country for because they believe that this was most likely ordered at the very top of the Saudi Government or at least there was consent for given at the very top level ... by NBS himself this is crazy this does not happen\nAnd people will say oh by the Russians yeah the Russians\nHave engaged in assassinations of critics and and but they they are tend to be a former Russian nationals they've done in the u._k. I Know but they've never done it in\nThere for the Russian nationals which this guy's a former Saudi national but as for Russian national and they never do it in a diplomatic facility though and they certainly wouldn't send multiple private jets with Russian officials I'm not saying that the the Russians are to ethical for this they're just not\nSo foolish as to do this\nBut then you get to the ... the then you get to the book then you go to the point where you have to ask ... hold on a second to the Saudis do it this way to send an even stronger message I often tell you on this show and are upset in the past that you know sometimes burning\nOn village sense and even stronger message you know we're burning down the whole village and not just one house obviously sends a stronger message too\nBut you don't have to burn down everything you can just make an example of one and here you have a very high profile critic Washington Post columnist who was writing about all of the\nReally what what is a mafia state and then the Saudis or a mafia stayed with a religious veneer I mean that but Saudi Arabia is a is a a club soccer see you know the ruling family has enriched itself the tune of who knows how many billions of I mean hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of of decades\nNow Saudi families incredibly rich and the Saudis are as you know very repressive goes all the way back to the unholy although they would have thought it was holy alliance between the fundamentalist preacher\nOn the Arabian Peninsula even Abdul how from the Eighteenth century\nBelieve he was born in Seventy no too I think he lived about Seventeen Ninety to ... or maybe Seventy eighty two so Eighteen century preacher who made this deal with the ... who were just warlords and that's how you get Saudi Arabia\nBut they merge together this religious or this religious extremism which is known as ... but they they don't like that term they prefer Salafis and Salafis means the forefathers of the Muslim faith states itself as it whether it's fundamentalism such it's Islamic fundamentalism\nAnd a ... law Mick liberalism text journalism although even that is kind of difficult to decipher because if you've ever read the Koran does a lot of [noise]\nUm but they killed that they've they've killed this guy now and it's going to cause some major problems on the international diplomatic scene I I'll get into why and what the what the end result of all this will be in just a moment we'll talk more about this\nWith looks to be most brazen high profile assassination of a rush that that I can remember stay with the\nMedia sites are the future of conversation my friends we notice I use it as a powerful tool and reaching out to you and spreading the word about the show and you use it among your friends and family to share your thoughts on everything that matters to you but we've seen so much\nOf the left wing bias at play in the last few years we know that Facebook and Google and these other massive social media enterprises have all kinds of left\nWing conversational health shadow banning nonsense going on if you want to put a stop to that we've got a new site for you sniff the dot com maybe dot com is a place where you can go and share whatever thoughts you want you don't have to worry about moderators administrators suppressing your freedom of expression\nAnother reality and I can say here but I can tell you that a lot of places you won't hear much criticism of this you won't hear it talked about as a story even the Saudis have really spent a tremendous amount of money\nInvesting in media in this country major corporations they're huge shareholders and major corporations\nAnd they also have invested a tremendous amount in some of our most prestigious universities\nSo they have an influence in cultural and information based institutions here\nThat allows them to mute criticism\nAnd that's something that we should all be aware of the Saudis have bought into American\nAmerican media in ways that let them call the shots and you won't hear talked about because they're caught a lot of shots they've written very very big checks and are not shy about throwing their weight around on these issues so\nKeep that in mind because when you look at what's going on with Saudi and you look at how friendly all\nAdministrations stretching back really for a century now in America are to Saudi Arabia [noise] it it's remarkable and this is\nThe argument the second most totalitarian state on the planet and we act like they're a bunch of good buddies of ours and it's just for reasons of short term self interest but we should at least be able to be honest about what's really going on there and I think the murder of his journalists might start that conversation [noise]\nDo you any eligible there'll be compensated for your time\nToday than we won three five six three seven zero one eight three five three seven zero one eight\nOf America

North American two hours\nTo get that would match dot com the folks at independent electrical contractors they know you're already a good electrician they want to help you become a better business owner lean last labor laws contract last form and training project management training [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America button that is that\nCould say I'm ... ... ... you think you are the most boring person enough that he might be for the last time I\nMight be backing from proceeding on first from an online behavior New Hampshire keen to churn out among sons have you found it on line [noise] um [noise] they know how to be done\nAnd I got to tell you I think that the the first lady ah first of all she she's right in saying that she gets just really\nMistreated by a lot of folks out there she's really never been treated like a first lady a there's a very widespread both in the open and behind closed doors a ongoing mockery and undermining of her from a mainstream\nPress that seems to just want to discount that she was a successful model that she speaks I think five languages\nAnd is an immigrant who is now the first lady of the United states that's just never the story with her they always jumped passed all of that and they say oh you know she's a third wife and she has a funny accent and all this stuff\nBut even putting that aside from a because we know that there's just a a different set of expectations that the media has for a Republican versus Democrat first families\nWhen when you compare Michelle Obama's lunch program uh with what I think the first lady right now I'm Alone is trying to accomplish\nOnline bullying really is a is a scourge and it's a cultural issue\nThat is relatively new and that I I think is corrosive do our society a whereas the the ... I've ... I've forgotten some of the visuals have tried to bring them back right now the doctor you are but Michelle Obama's lunch thing was yeah let's just tell kids they all have to eat like boiled\nKale that's going to go over really well if you saw some of the the lunch initiative the first lady was pushing and what she thought kids were going to eat I mean yes theoretically you could tell people that have\nTo baby carrots or some alfalfa sprouts and an apple and maybe a tiny tiny packet of of almond butter and say that that's lunch but I don't think that's necessarily going to take off in terms of popularity I'm not sure you've you've solved solved a you know child nutritional issues in our schools\nBy it's actually making sure they're going to be hungry and not enjoy lunchtime\nBut online bowling's over a very real thing and and I just wonder how this is one of these things I think about it in advance now how do parents even deal with this it's bad enough that kids get bullied in school and the old fashioned way I really can't even begin to to fathom\nHow I Would handle having a kid who was getting really badly Boyd and it's not just kids were Boyd as we do I mean there are there are adults who are just relentlessly cyber harassed I I'm really in favor of\nOf accountability for people who are going to do that meeting I think that these social media companies instead of just saying oh well you know we're gonna block they should be like well look if if you don't stop his behavior we're going to get your IP address to the person being harassed and then they have the right to sue you right we're going to\nMake it harder for people to just get away with this behavior they've gotten a lot better I mean the different platforms I Will say now seem to well they've over corrected a bit by going after political speech but stuff it's really personal and threatening and violence or that that should\nBe shifted out by these by these companies and I know that doesn't that forces to speak first time a discussion of well what's what's really going to be\nCut out what is going to be edited from the conversation as a result of all this I Know it it's not easy uh but I just think that that the first lady bringing bringing it back to home base here for a moment I think the first man he gets a gets a raw deal I think that people are um she she keeps are pretty low profile all things considered\nAnd I even when she has little moments where they say she's being a bit ah what's rebellious from the Trump orbit you can tell that that the media just has no real affinity for her no real respect for\nA and it's it's a shame a it's a shame it that's the case and I think that that's also why\nYou're seeing a shift now away from covering the sort of a a away from covering a lot of the policy ... because people are tired of it and I think that they feel like the first lady is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "12"}
