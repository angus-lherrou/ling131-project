gal mouth is somehow self serving you were just All right to be just All right\nThey're all in it for themselves I saw this a Heidi Heitkamp that senator from North Dakota came out and\nSaid she was going to vote against Kavanaugh and everybody was like wow that's that's so brave North Dakota Democrat Senator that's a pretty red state how would you do that 'cause she's down ten points in the polls in about to get massacred anyway she\nDid it because she's about to get a big fat paying job but some D.C lobbying for\nIf she'd voted it if you voted yes on Kavanaugh's you wouldn't get that

what I Want it to this fantastic\nYou you know your ... are already either taken in this progressive clap trap\nOr you realize that the country is doing really well I mean I was just we just played some\nOn air I mean those were all from CNN and MSNBC you know this is all\nWhat's offered to the Democrats right now whether it'll be thirty days in power or thousand you're right I mean comparing the geo Peter Nazi isn't serious people don't do this intelligent people don't say this without feeling deeply embarrassed at least\nBut the left does not feel embarrassed they are licking their wounds this week I think that conservatives under the circumstances have been\nA quite generous in how we have responded now that we've finally achieved justice and yes it is justice for judge Kavanaugh to now be on the Supreme Court\nOr we recognize that there are other things to turn our focus do we recognize that there are other ways to spend our time and attention\nI was very pleased that uh last night President Trump did take a moment to apologize for what was done to judge Kavanaugh in the White House at a ceremony play a clip one\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett\nAnd the entire cabinet or family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise]\nThose step forward just serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception [noise]\nWhat happened to the cabinet or a family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman [noise] phone ways be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nThe presumption of innocence a has been something that is under\nAssault here from the very beginning I mean the the presumption of innocence was going to be collateral damage was going to be a casualty of this whole process\nAnd sure enough it was saved the last moment but but understand that it was a very close fought battle\nIt could have gone the other way and Democrats would have had no problem in fact it would have been gleeful had it gone the other way wouldn't have thought twice about what had been lost in this whole process\nDespite all of that Kavanaugh is bending over backwards doing everything in his power to make it quite clear that he will be a fair\nAnd dare I say judicious judge that he will do everything that he can to continue his legacy of decades of\nPublic service you know Kevin all went to Yale undergrad yellow on top of his closet both he could have gone to any one of the big fancy law firms he would've made partner he'd be making\nEasily few million dollars a year right now easily studies or\nBeen in a federal judge DC circuit court of appeals to me probably makes\nOn every now and less than two hundred grand something like that\nWhich you could say well bug you still makes a good living yeah I get it but you know he could be making millions but he didn't do that he's gone into the judiciary and understands that that's a very important role in very important service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praise and understood to be top of this field\nThat's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions\nWithin the right Kavanaugh was from the ... gold standard choice he wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick\nKevin on was the guy who was doing what he could in order to at least be impartial as a judge should be whenever he hears cases\nAnd they tried to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys families destroys reputation\nThat there is no more room for anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and so yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives take their arguments more seriously play more fair with them be a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore\nIt's not a serious argument\nInstill the limbs finally recognize\nThat what they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done that they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we know it'd be good and right for the country no matter how much they scream\nNo matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act\nLike a bunch of savages we have to push forward and we have to stay United\nAnd we have to win Trump understands that that said\nKavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and heal the country and so forth and so much as possible foreign play quick to\nArticle three of the constitution provides a judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme

and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he did that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court he was with the majority opinion of\nAlmost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interprets the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much\nBut there is an underlying truth year and that is that the country is a better place with more respect for the rules were there will be more respect the rule of law where every American will have his rise more respected under the constitution because\nBut rather judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice Kevin liberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't the constitution says that thing you wanted to say\nEven though it doesn't at least cabinet will say I may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes\nNo one tried to ruin his reputation\nYou know there's real psychological damage that is done to people from false allegations people have been as was the case in the ... driven to suicide by false allegations especially when that involves false allegations of rape or sexual assault\n'cause you are an untouchable in society even your own loved ones you know friends and family may think differently a few if they believe that it's true I think anybody with a brain news the Capitol did not do these things certainly his own family knew he did not do these things was completely innocent of it\nBut to compare the Merrick Garland situation to cabinet or even bring them up in the same sentence I think lacks\nJudgment I think that that is a poor context or for the overall discussion\nAnd but then he made one other point which was a good one because you know a a that on a dirt Shaq got a call balls and strikes\nThere says that the only way that this gets fixed as if\nThe American people hold the Democrats responsible at the polls yeah\nThat is the only the only check on the ... that the lead seeks to impose upon the

what they what they're teaching in schools now in some of these departments in women's studies a woman and gender studies we called the bags\nAt Amherst College where I went\nI took a wax class that was interesting\nUh it was actually Islamic constructions of gender so I took a class on a women's engender studies class on Islam who wants to guess how critical\nOf of the Islamic faith the women's

but that's that's how that's how they thought you know the burqa freeze women they would say I know this is the stuff that I was subjected to college radicalized me as a conservative in a sense\nOf being a radical conservative just means that you know you like celebrating the fourth of July I have read the constitution and it and it ... and it matters to you I'm that's being a radical conservative you know somebody who ... who believes\nThe constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservative according to the left\nThe college was certainly a process radicalization for me and that way but the grieving studies

the ultimate ... we we are\nPublic enemy number one in America and there's a lot of us so obviously a lot of enemies we are the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way you're not saying oh gosh that can't really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole Kavanaugh debacle and I say that about the process it's as any of you listen to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I'd been about any anything\nUm in defense of Kavanaugh in in in absolute

parody song about statements I suppose we could say it's a scary time for women according to a her assessment\nBut ah here's look she's got she's ... years out some of it goes ...\nMaiden name na na na I'm ...\nI Can't use them and then when you might end in Ninety and anger andme man again\nAnd again you know you're not there any\nOkay now\nAre there is that they're nice voice obviously has some talent political analysis is not one of them a few things you said\nAbout any other people say oh buckets art and she was running okay but she's this was a parody song she's making a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to what the president said about how it's a scary\nTime to be a man she says things like it is or rather ... you can't have the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe neighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme\nI'm considering also that America is at the now the bottom end of a fifty year decline in violent crime I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but and then just say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone well I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and\nLet them go to the bar without a chaperone and\nI Know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to wherever they screw it whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM is when someone DM somebody else on Twitter or you know write them on Facebook or who would say whatever they felt like saying\nSo why are we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are ridiculous Clinton's\nNow that's not to say that bad things don't happen\nTo women every day across the country and there aren't bad men out there who perpetrate horrible crimes with someone of of course we all know that that we're we're having we're trying to have an adult conversation here we're not having a conversation\nAbout oh you're saying there's no and this is what the left does producing sexual assault is it a problem of course of ...\nIt's a it's a heinous crime a felony for which people are severely punished as they should be\nBut there's a hysteria and this is what I'm really\nTrying to get out with the lyrics in this song and the way that the media talks about this there's this hysteria among leftist feminists\nRape culture on campus rape culture is a myth Thursday ... culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nUh so what where is this coming from and I mean the truth is that the same identity politics to be very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nA it also applies to the way that the left views the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women\nIn American society and it's just not in keeping with reality and that is\nVery troubling because once again we have this problem of\nHow old are you engage with the other side when you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like women walk around dressing how I mean I'm here in D.C I've lived in New York ... this is this is not\nThe Taliban version of America wouldn't walk around dressing however the water as they will showed\nAnd women are\nVery safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world\nAnd and there's something inherently that that feels a little ah unjust about claiming publicly in this way\nAnd it's not just the singers are this is this is common among the ... that that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures admit that we don't care about these issues that as a slur that as a slender just not true\nWhy did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women sexually assaulted\nOr because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault which is what was included in some of those surveys\nOf so the facts don't line up with this but\nFacts in this and with many other things\nMake liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion first fat free zone and

ambassador position is that it's a two un is is that it doesn't really make that much difference why people are so focused on it now is that\nNikki Haley is an interesting political figure in the Trump orbit she's obviously female she's a half South Asian and so she has a my you know people don't think of her as a minority female she is a minority female or you know she has minority female\nOr in her background or rather she is by background of minority female um she's also liked by the establishment\nPeople think that Nikki Haley is in that circle of Trump administrator and officials who are not surprises Judy the beltway swamp types right I mean there's there's ... there's Nikki Haley\nUm there's trying to think of who else would be you know you think of who who would be in the rules are in now in any administration that's going to the game you can play of Kelly is chief of staff I mean there there's some people but certainly\nOr well within what your expectations would be for the role that they have 'em\nBut the Trump Administration is non traditional and that is included a lotta nontraditional appointments but so Haley fits into that circle of people that are thought to be\nEstablishment approved a and so when\nShe left initially when she announced her resignation there was a moment of oh my gosh what does this mean\nAnd as I said I don't think it means very much at all I think that she served two years she's on good terms with the president and from what we know all of his chief policy folks oh but that was gonna say pumped but I I\nI don't think pumped pale would have been secretary of state and another minister ration but he's a former congressman he's a somewhat establishment figure I think compares great but you know he's somewhat of an established he's a Tea Party cars but I Know but still um\nBut I don't think ... this matters all that much people find that interesting because the dynamics between Trump and\nAnd and Haley and the others in his cabinet who were thought of as being very Trump be whereas Nikki Haley is not but I think Trump season is increasingly\nI've always thought it's a compliment but increasingly now it's really an honor effect right it's it's a title that guys being trumpeted that means is kicking button taking names so why\nAlso they focus on Nikki Haley today oh was the big story oh my gosh Nikki Haley's up\nBecause there's thought in the GOP that Nikki Haley is is the most likely post Trump GOP nominee now let's just pull that down to earth for a moment here uh\nDoes anyone really know what the political climate is going to look like in six years never mind in in you know in in ... or in in in two years never my six answers now you got no idea I Am I absolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalists like to do which has come up with a narrative that will interest people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation still filled the airwaves with speculation and you know you'll you'll ah never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation is easy and cheap so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this but those are all I think so and so it was going to run on ... part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nOn the honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that you necessarily\nI'm quite as a compelling candidate because here's here's what the would you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish and a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side who achieves high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be\nA lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh that she was a a gender traitor which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise] um but I think that uh\nYou know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day and so everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into play quits wealth\nComing into the air and my goal is that we make sure that everything is in an effort to come back in ... and I'm proud and part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour for six years and we got like a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting associating with a lot like how many\nYears have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been a cat [laughter] I'm and I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to be tough enough to know when you\nFound in someone else to do the job [laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah there you go partner on good terms reputation intact\nDidn't have some big or inter personal blow up with the administration that's why she's leaving folks I Wish I could tell you there was some crazy or stories and that and if if there is all certainly that you know but for now it is what it is Nikki Haley's heading out\nDoesn't really matter who cares\n[laughter] that's my analysis of it I Know all book no what are you doing uh but I Do want to spend a little time of the on the midterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now kind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing\nAnd creating permanent stability and an ... would that that's not now I Know we're still in Afghanistan but we're not losing people every day we we don't have a hundred hundred and fifty thousand troops serving in these countries are serving in in a war zones\nAnd overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset that is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the left going into these midterms that's going to come up and just a moment [noise]\nUm but when you look at other areas foreign policy economy executive orders regulations\nAreas where the president is the is the decider which is a great word that Bush going for the English language what Bush for all of his verbal in Felicity\nOr for all of his clumsiness with the way that he would speak sometimes did give us the decider which is a great term effect you could have a whole show probably just called the decider um but as the decided within the executive branch the areas where Trump is able to just do things\nHave been among the most successful of its presidents maybe the most successful\nOr Congress was able to pass tax reform which is a good thing corporations are hiring more which is a good thing you go down this list\nAll of the things that we're told are downsides all of the negatives that they ascribed to Trump relate to style and tone and verbiage and\nUh and and statements that the president has made so what they're really hoping and this is why the media has to work so hard on this issue what they're hoping is that people will\nUh you know enough Americans will forget about what Trump has actually done and accomplish and replace it with what the media says Trump says well the media's been telling us is in Trump's mind or in his heart for last Eighteen months not the actions that he has taken\nAs commander in chief\nI I I had high hopes for drop when he first took office and he has exceeded them in terms of what he has been able to do he has exceeded them and he has done all of that and I know this\nIsn't going to convince any I don't think any moderates are centrists to who really joined right here is you know in key in the house races you need Republicans to get some upset victories\nUh but yeah I don't think there's going to convince people to do that necessarily\nBut what do you think about where we are as a country right now and what they have gone to this president along the way it is bonkers this role special counsel and the and the investigation into the grinding machinery of this\nA special counsel bureaucracy chewing people up costing them fortunes in legal fees threatening everybody with perjury charges all of this\nTrump is how to do this with that Obama didn't have that Obama didn't have\nThat for his first two years in office okay and and you look at the comparisons of over people say oh you inherited you know that yeah there was an economic reset from decades of bad policy when it came to housing and lending which by the way it was pushed by social justice warriors that's a whole other conversation\nBut the bank bailout everyone always look at the bank bailout happened on Bush's watch tarp\nIs what happened on ... or rather the stimulus pardon me ... the stimulus is what happened on Obama's watch that's what a ... which was a trillion dollars of what exactly does that do oh that's right give a lot of money away to a Democrat grab bag issues and causes and and buddies and special interests\nThat's what the stimulus trillion dollars of just you know Democrats bending stuff on whatever they want to spend money on to help the economy that was your money they spent\nThe bailout of the banks occur when Trump was in office right so I'm Sorry when Bush was in office\nSo this whole thing that Obama turn the economy around no everything he did actually made the ... made the slowest and most painful economic recovery since the great depression so this is just a rewriting of history they're engaged and in Obama's last two years in office\nThey were trying to excuse the weak economic growth they were trying to excuse the lack of optimism about the corporate and investing environment in this country about jobs and wages and how they were stagnant that they were coming up with anything to make Obama seemed like he was oh just so great\nAnd now an ... hold together\nTrump has been doing a fantastic job he really has I Would love to see the Republicans stay in power in the house and the Senate because I think it'll be good for the whole country I think it will be good for you for me for even the silly lives out there running around\nCheering on anti for you good for everybody I just don't know if we'll be able to hang on\nThe Senate yes house\nIt's going to be tight it's going very oh but here's a little production for you and traditions are fun Ted Cruz is going to creme ... when push comes to shove on election day [noise]\n\nIn fact you know because when it comes to the fight for self saw never saw the federal\nWith a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that Clinton that lady can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nCivility folks Hillary Clinton one of the leaders\nOf the lives is out there telling people that\nFor civility to Richard in our politics today for that to happen\nDemocrats has to win this is the problem we have right now with the political exchange between the two sides\nThey are delusional\nThis reminds me of an of an editorial that I had been meaning to bring up to you or earlier in the week I Am so excited to talk to you on Monday could've been a few days than a skip right past us but the editor in chief of Politico\nWho I I don't I'm not even really familiar with I Know what political ... which was a political side for left wing people a dozen bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a but he wrote a piece about how maybe more or less it's time to to take the gloves off\nA about how ... maybe now is the time\nFor Democrats to stop playing nice stop playing nice they were accusing cabinet of being a gang rape is during Senate hearings these people are completely\nInsane they're completely nuts how\nDo you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do when people call you a Nazi because you're pro Second Amendment I said\nThere's nothing you can do don't engage because you're talking you might as well be talking to a person who's pushing around a shopping cart with you know John three sixteen written on a piece of cardboard\nHanging out of it I mean that's that's what we're up against now and this is unfortunately the end result of a massive\nMedia echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking some form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on here\nPeople think that this is a normal way to approach their problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side should just go completely scorched earth insane and then they to borrow from the left the Democrats have normal lives they're crazy and it is they're crazy tactics and\nSo what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a a nother\nNetwork or\nSome of their friends with another network you were saying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurants that's not a mom\nI I'm Sorry that's them up if we can't agree and this was a CNN\nAnd I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm gonna let it just uh 'cause 'cause I\nI like the I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it at some level if we can't agree\nThat the people that are changing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are public officials who are laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for\nA ... if if they're going to laugh about that if they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens sent meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces anything else\nIf they're going to say that that's OK in that storm all we have no choice but to own the lives are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know how else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it that is the ... that is the only option there is no other option\nYou know people who think that a gathering of angry loud\nAnd you have inequality not just in terms of economic outcomes would inequality before the law\nThese these are just the basic laws of human nature and power the left does not believe in these things and they'll say oh but look at what about the equality in Sweden first of all they think that equality just means having a large welfare state\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries of the left points to a there's not a huge emphasis on\nThis date enforcing the same outcome was for all people right there were some people do better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes some people there's only so much the state is able to do\nIt unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful that you no longer have any individual rights you have whatever the state Danes to leave you\nUm but I suppose I'm getting too deep into this rabbit hole a here's what I Would say about\nOh wait we've got more social Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser Tucson loser for president never really done anything impressive in her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP the Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nSo a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listen to the show ... many of you\nSolve that very very early on I have not just come around to it now I I consider\nMyself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way of doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning\nBut that's not just a slogan you win or bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example that the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a roe v Wade and there are other things you could power right on top of that\nThen there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them\nFrom having the power to enact there will uh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time\nThat CNN sits down to some degree of your own on one pool that Christie on whatever name as sits down with her I just said her name's obviously I ... I just don't like\nTo say it because it's ... it's ... uh not Christine it's ... and she told the front of my sons are but they'll call it he'll call Hillary out you don't sit there and and just allow or to get away with allies and the nonsense\nBut on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this me to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nI'm a porous Hillary about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to a brass tacks place that\nHe said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the un to obviously you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband have a pet to answer this question is have a pet for them and how do you see that\nSo many different from what President Trump is being accused of and cabinet and others today\nWell there's a very significant difference I\nAnd that is the intense [noise]\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted\nIn the nineties [noise] if I'm On\nThe other Republicans starting with President Trump on down I Want to a comparison nation welcome such an investigation themselves\n\nIsn't that an incredible sleight of hand from a dishonest and dare I say only ...\nPolitician oh\nThere's a big difference alright between what happened with Kavanaugh and what happened with Hillary Clinton's husband Bill Clinton one is that his misdeeds\nOccurred while he was president of the United states or\nIn the case of the credible accusations of rape on the record by women he did have sexual interactions with who did know him worth seeing him there was no question about where they were or did you ever actually occur in terms of the date and time and could they have been there all the things that we never get answers for Ford\nBill Clinton was accused of rape by Juanita broader Broderick by he was accused of sexual assault by Jennifer Flowers and these women came forward and said that he was a\nPredator a predator and\nSure enough Hillary not only didn't divorce him didn't you know you say that those women should be believe she went on our fence against those women the difference is not the investigation between Kavanaugh and Clinton the difference\nThat one of them actually is a predator and the other or the Democrats tried to sue me or as a predator that's the difference but Hillary\nIt showed dishonest in so disgraceful that you think she can get away with well one was a long investigation and the other you know there wasn't one of them was being investigated for what he did while president while governor of Arkansas the other was being being accused of ... when he was Seventeen year old kids thirty six years ago\nBut it still thinks she can hit hit back at Trump for quote demeaning women play\nWhat was done last night in the White House with a political rally\nIt further undermined the image and integrity of the court um and that\nTroubles me greatly it saddens me because arguing she'll sit and has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government so\nI don't know how people are going to react to it I think given our divides it will pretty much fall predictably between those who were four and those who are against\nWhat the president's been true to form he has insulted attacked demeaned women um throughout the campaign really for many years leading up to the campaign and he's continued to do that or inside the White House\nYou know who else has has demeaned in insulted women folks\nHillary Clinton when it suited her\nAnd you know what else is true and also said here on the show you know ... gonna be in trouble as long as the feminist left in this country embraces Hillary Clinton the feminists left cannot credibly there's that word claim to really be about empowering women [noise]\nEvery day I have the incredible honor and privilege upbringing you my thoughts you're on this program but I Want you to have\nTo call your own I Want you to be able to go to a place and share your thoughts post photos engaging topics that matter\nAnd when I started to see the impact of that I really said wow there's something to this\nUm and what's interesting doc is when you do a little bit of research you find that these devices\nAre programs by Silicon Valley to be addictive you know they are studying behavioral science and behavioral psychology and breaking down ways for how many times we need to know how many times do we need to create\nSomething in this game so that it creates you know a ... for people to be addicted and how many times do we need Snapchat to do X Y and Z to get people addicted to streaks and we're a bunch of puppet\nSo being a personal responsibility girl that I Am it was like oh I Want the free market to shut this down it was hey wait a minute just because you're designing these things to get us addicted doesn't mean that we actually have to to use them that way\nYou know what I'm saying all this stuff it it makes me think\nOf some of the uncomfortable recognitions about myself but I've had it's in the last year maybe year and a half were I realize things like\nI get a little to do and I don't know if the only ones I talked to ... about it I mean I've talked about on the show\nI feel anxious if I don't have my if I don't have my smartphone within reach I feel like I'm going to miss a call I'm going to miss an email something's going to have a doesn't mean I have to look at it all the time although I Do look at it too much\nIt means though that you start to have this I Need to be able to physically touch my phone or if there's something wrong I Know I'm not the only one\nRight and that and as you know if anybody who's done a detox with food you know how you you go you do your juice fast for five days at first\nYou feel kind of sick you feel even more nervous because now you're you're pulling all this stuff out of your body that's bad that happens initially initially you have more anxiety 'cause you're like wait a minute what am I missing and might not plugged in I remember losing my phone and a taxi cab and I tell a lot of really\nEmbarrassing crazy personal stories in this book and one of them is that I lost it and a cat it was like I had lost the child or a dog or something that was alive I was completely untethered that was a sign that I hadn't I coined that phrase OCC\nThe obsessive compulsive disorder people laugh but it's really really true and and and the thing is to you you and I around the same age but I think I'm a little older than you I don't know why it has brought that up maybe the audience can forget I just said that but\nThe ... times you know looks twenty five so for all intents and purposes use twenty five go ahead my friend\nBut but we come from a time where we grew up and we didn't have all this intrusion we didn't have all the social media we weren't setting staring at the cell phones\nWhat drove me crazy is thinking about kids getting into dating for the first time and they're doing it all on these phones parents should be worried\nThat their kids are not learning basic skills I wrote an article for bus all this week saying you know I remember my middle school dance and the way that you know the boy had to kind of get the courage up across the middle school dance floor and asked me out and\nFace the potential rejection and you know learn how to handle those face to\nFace conversations for the first time\nThese were the things that turn boys and girls and women and men and now you have kids hiding behind these devices they're they're not they're spread it completely than among a bunch of people things like intimacy and personal conversation or getting lost in those first relationship people have in college and and slightly beyond\nYoung kids don't they don't know how to have\nIn their personal relationships they don't know how to communicate anymore because they're doing everything by tax all the time so it's multi faceted the problem I'm having been a teacher for years I Can't tell you how many phones we confiscated

global level by the way it's going to be everywhere they're going to be rising overseas then I Believe that maybe there's something to be concerned about when it comes to climate change\nUntil the people who go to fancy un style climate\nConferences all over the world stop all taking individual private jets I'm not going to believe that this is real I respond to warnings as a rational person would which is provide me with the evidence and explained to me why I should believe what you were saying don't try to\nShame me into it don't try to take the perspective that\nIf I don't agree with you I must just be ignorant or foolish right try to walk me through this and saying all the scientists agree does not count because one that's not true they repeat it anyway though I Would not always a very bad sign an argument\nThis you know here's an example of this liberals will say there's no such thing as voter fraud and then I provide them with a case of documented voter fraud where someone to prison and they say oh okay fine but you know there's not a lot of voter fraud why do you keep saying there's no voter fraud\nYou you you know that's not true right but you're trying to just create a climate where there's no discussion of voter fraud that's why they do it\nWhy do you say there's there's there are no scientist that disagree with this quote consensus on climate change let's not because they don't know that there obviously are including professor Richard limbs in from MIT a pretty well known place\nA ... the founder of the weather channel another guy who is\nQuestioning the climate consensus such as it is a lord bumped in\nJust a journalist but a guy who's pulled all the stuff together he just pulled together all the crap predictions and said you guys are wrong you that climate change police are wrong wrong wrong over and over again stretching back for decades and you're not a little bit wrong you're entirely wrong and then you start changing the numbers and making excuses\nBut then they try to suppress conversation this by saying what is it again that's right\nDo you believe in climate change at the answer is no you're not allowed to be a part of the discussion you are an intellectual untouchable eyes she they want to suppress the debate they don't want to have a debate they want to suppress the debate\nAnd they want to convince everybody there is no voter fraud how could even talk about voter fraud well there is oh okay but it's not a lot of voter fraud and you must be a racist way what I just thought were talking about wrote a voter fraud\nThis is the way that they do it this is how they play the game important that you will we are constantly made aware of this week we make ourselves aware of this we are made or wherever it by the way that they act\nBut notice how also they they tied is into Trump\nThis is another version of oh let the UN releases this report and now all these different news organizations are reporting not just on catastrophic catastrophic climate change what is catastrophic flooding even mean think about that for a moment\nCould they define that 'cause they tell me what what that that there's going to be a flood somewhere at some point in the next ten years that kills people going to be very tragic and look very bad\nThat's always been the case there were a rainstorm there were floods there are flash floods this is not new but they don't want to define it this is all about creating intellectual\nConformity for really emotional conformity because that's what moved the needle on climate change [noise]\nHow does it make you feel that the climate is changing [noise] that's what they're trying to [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nExactly you know because when it comes to the fight for some thought never saw [noise] more about how a\nFly promoting division and hatred we will promote unity inclusion and love\nOur job is to build on our common humanity and to do everything that we can to oppose the war

tried to divide us up in every way possible\nAt the set off against\nEach other we must do the same and create an international progressive community that stands for social economic racial and religious justice for all\nThat's ripe Bernie Sanders\nWe're going to come back we're going to come together will get a call for the wall border of progress of Islam a\nBernie Sanders I I wanted to get away from the whole un climate change topic because there's there's so foolish but they're so devoted to it\nNot just because of what they've been brainwashed into thinking about the threat to the planet I I I wanted to know that that's there there's a whole nother component of this discussion which is that they think that climate change that pushing climate change hysteria is a way to get\nCloser to a one world government and and I know that's that sounds like crazy talk but there's also why ... why do liberals have such an affinity for the United nations the United nations has\nProven itself ineffectual so many times over at its core missions uh it it has not prevented genocide despite UN Mandate to do so it\nHas not prevented armed conflict despite you know un efforts to do so and it often give some of the worst most offensive and odious regimes on the planet cover for their activities because you know Libya will be on the human rights council or whatever\nYou know that they they have this fall the notion that all nations should be treated as somewhat equal when the truth is that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there\nThere were some crap hole governments and then there are some pretty good governments or at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity and solidarity\nThat goes beyond any one nations sovereignty the now now you're getting further along and to what the progressive and state he is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nI ... it's all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word among the less because they think that a democracy is an idealized state of all people being equal in all ways\nWhich of course interesting to me is somebody who has a has an interest in ancient history and and western civilization is if you go back to the the earliest democracy or ancient Athens in Greece\nOr they only had a very small percentage of the population that could vote you had to be a landowner you can be a slave there was a whole\nI had to be male obviously you got to be ... you had to be a land owning a resident of what would essentially be the upper middle class to the upper class to be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know ... the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority\nAre ... by whatever the majority says that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show",
