{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "For them to get fired up over while they fought against the racist ... Klux Klan I'm going to make a bold statement here if you want Christopher Columbus are raised from the history books you're doing the Ku Klux Klan of the early twentieth century a favor because that's exactly what they wanted to\nChristopher Columbus is a man who was once the euro to those targeted by the most racist people in our country who also happened to be Democrats\nNow he's being targeted by antifa vandals and progressive politicians as they attempt to take down a statue all over America ironically it's hard for so called progressive ... to understand the basic question from our past if we erase history\nAre doomed to repeat it\nBy the way it's supposed to be the opposite of progress to call themselves progressives selective too busy honoring alleged child molesters like Marie are murderers like iodine or no notice their own shortcomings I did I say so much for progress man they don't have new ideas that's the reason why all they can do is fight back against Kavanaugh\nThere's nothing progressive about progressive is um it's not a new idea socialism has been around for centuries in fact talking about Christopher Columbus well the earliest American settlers the pilgrims briefly tried to experiment\nWith a with a with a political and economic system not unlike communism or socialism in which everyone shares and get all gets along guess how it worked out here that toilet flushing yeah that's the blue wave but in this sense [laughter] it's also the idea of socialism failing the earliest American settlers\nDidn't work for them at all they ended up using capitalism you know why because capitalism works and it's awesome sometimes the left\nJust has silly ideas and their ideas are often misguided and confused and inspired by things from real life but it may seem to make sense at the time but never actually do when they come out and [laughter] and our practice in this little thing we call reality\nAll right so shifted focus on that note taking that into consideration all their silly ideas I stumbled across the news story earlier and it gave me a silly idea if I was a progressive\nThis is how I Would read a news story like this\nI'd read this news story and I would come up with an idea that is economically sound an ecologically friendly and absolutely misguided and ridiculous money to buy and\nI'd like you all the travel with me real quick to Louisville, Kentucky where police are searching for to Kentucky jail inmates face scapegoat late Saturday evening by hiding in a trash can yes\nIt's true folks public transit a favor recycling and using mass transit on all the things the progressive love and living in a government institution progressive love these things\nAnd breaking the law that's also something of progressive swap it actually happened about ten o'clock on Saturday Night Justin somewhere and Jeremy Hunter scape from Louisville metro corrections by\nHiding in the food waste trash cans were then taken outside of the facility for disposal according\nTo a statement from the jail [laughter] so a witness saw the matter scraped and he notified of corrections officer but not in time for them to knock it away you know you could only imagine what was going on in the jail that day some guy was like hey there's\nSome guys are going to skip I better tell the I better tell the prison guard\nAnd about Fifteen minutes [laughter] you know in a way I'm sure he wanted the or he wanted to do the right thing by reporting the missing but he also didn't want to help the guards right isn't that isn't that the uh you know the the rules of the road when you're living in jail I guess and anyway\nSo both of these guys similar in hunt they were working in the jail kitchen so I guess you see how you got access to the garbage a metric corrections said the men were both minimum security inmates arrest warrants have been issued for them\nAs a Sunday Morning neither of them have been found in the last I checked I don't it's it's Monday now I don't think they've been found yet either Jefferson town police arrested storm or on August twenty seventh because of charges of motor vehicle thefts so he stole a gun and he was a felon in possession of a of a of a handgun no he stole a car and he had a hand gun\nAnd he also had ... felony drug possession of drug paraphernalia so probably like a pipe or something we'd I don't know anyway so here's my idea I told you guys just gave me an idea I think quite progressive you hear a news story like this and you set yourself okay\nThe prison inmates living in a state correctional institution and they traveled outside of the prison in a garbage can well that sounds like it's\nAffordable low cost ecological you sound it involves mass transit that's all the things progressive swamp there's probably an idea and this somewhere they just haven't quite put their finger on it yet [noise]\nHey commuters argue sick of sitting in traffic for hours on end while you try to get to work I share and but what other choice do I have things to do and make sperm the Louisville metro corrections Institute now you can get to and from work faster than ever\nWith the Kentucky rapid dress transit system rapid trashed transit how does that work it's easy public threats receptive goals are located all over our city while many people use them to dispose of trash most people probably don't even realize you can hit you're riding them to cut\nYou short can just climbing side and wait until your friendly neighborhood trash man comes by to pick up the garbage\nTrash man excuse me that's not gender inclusive heart in us we meant trash person so that are that are but how long that the way before our trash person gets to ride it\nDoesn't take long at all just wait a few short hours while sitting in a pile of British garbage and you'll be there in ... Kentucky rapid dress transit system is just as affordable as it is eco friendly with well that\nSounds great I just sitting in a pile of garbage thanks government\nYour welcome this message paid for by the Kentucky rep address transit system banks government it's such a beautiful idea yes\nIn in the progressive dystopian future we all ride to work inside of a garbage truck because that's the way the government is oh okay I guess I'm just being ridiculous but hey speaking of ridiculous how many of you saw this photo over the weekend that ... this viral photo that surfaced on line\nThat said do not warm urine is a picture of a microwave at uh Jacksonville gas station and apparently they're located right near to drug test and clinics now some of you're probably wondering why would they want it why would you want to go in there and microwave urine well they need to get the urine to be body temperature\nBefore they can be drug tested so I guess these poor people this family of Indian people that own are Pakistani or whatever they are\nHad so many junkies coming in their microwaving their urine but they had to put up a sign you think you've got problems you know\nIt's a strange time strange times we're living in folks anyway I'm Ken Webster junior for the last hour here I've been live on Cape here see just like I Am every afternoon at two PM I Love when you guys called me up I Love hearing from you guys your emails and everything else all the kind words\nEverybody downloading the pod cast um thanks so much for all the support you can always download the podcast get caught up in Ken Webster junior dot com go ahead and hit me up send me an email or Cape you see radio dot com talking about your junior dot com takes you right to my blog ... radio\nThanks for listening folks have a great day it makes you tuning into pursuit of happiness radio [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd has killed tracks with labor is why when no after day\nSwing mixture you break out all our great failure party ... whether you're at home or the stadium the new I our Radio Free ... collection\nRefer to Germany did America studios\nAll your to your\n\nSinuses to be a team player I Lisa like Sarah Fox news those comments from Supreme Court justice by Kevin Ida White House ceremony today toxicity perhaps board has more lively\nAnd going into his second term after he beat Romney just thinking to myself what is it that so many of my fellow Americans do not understand that I had to wrestle with that or grapple with it\nSo much of it was objects and so much of it was Romney's unwillingness to rise to the kind of fight he was in he didn't really understand Trump understands and he rose to this occasion soda Cavanaugh I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all of this is just how insane the left has become\nLess ... has turned into a kind of mass panic a widespread\nDelusion a collective nervous breakdown each\nNo longer enough for people to disagree with others based on politics they have to shriek into this into the air\nThey have to bang on doors they have to attack old men holding signs they have to harass people in the streets chase them out of restaurants and threatening letters docks members of the Senate threatened to dock their shoulder\n\nThere was word over the weekend of senators who had been a ... with threats against themselves against families against grandchildren of senators\nFox anchor was ducked into the subway we'll talk later on about that a writer for Stephen Colbert bears crappy late night program\nSweet it out that she was quote just glad we ruined his life about Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had protesters clawing like crazed animals at the Supreme Court doors and yes you even had Taylor Swift come out in favor of the Democratic party in Tennessee T swift how could you\nKnow she's very serious a vicious something quite different or the left has lost it uh they they no longer\nSeek to meet us on a battlefield of ideas we're reason even plays a role nowadays emotion it'd slogans is the mob not just cheering on one side\nBut demanding deal butter ration of the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases for decades\nThey don't want to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally with sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts\nAnd that triggering they think justifies violent response we saw this in some of the antics of ... over the weekend attacking people on streets acting like the maniacs they are\nAnd we see this from the way that the less reacts to political defeat we want conservatives won the good guys one with capital and notice there's really not any gloating\nThere's not an endless victory parade going on television\nThere is in the sense of now that we've beat the other side in the war let's go round and they and that all the survivors were not rubbing their faces in it although a little bit of spike no football perhaps as an order\nBecause to us this was just what shouldn't have been done this was just this was right life goes on there are other battles to fight there are other arguments to be had but also\nIn the conservative mind today in America you can have a separation between who you vote for what policies you support what you what you believe in your politics\nAnd who you are and your day to day life I don't mean that you don't live your ideals and beliefs but I mean you don't feel the need to only exist in that fear of what his political\nTo be a good conservative you have to focus on things like shooting people with respect acting\nWith honor and decency and kindness things that the leftist media tends to just near at\nThings that pop culture dominated by the left rituals but you realize that you can't be a true conservative without doing those things and it's just so much easier in so much more self gratifying so much more satisfying to the self\nDo show up and scream about how ... will be the death of millions of women just scream about how the patriarchy is alive and well dressed in stupid costumes and carry idiotic placards and act like the country is falling apart and democracies in peril because\nProcessors do respected in the Senate\nBecause the presumption of innocence as a principle that we have maintained understand this if they have gotten away with this plant if the left and managed to sink Kavanaugh it was the beginning of the end of any kind of\nHonest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side of anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious smears and character assassination\nAnd there would have been this sense that once the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation is the verdict and because they were deprived of that secret weapon\nBecause the less isn't going to be able to do that they had a complete meltdown ...\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nWhy don't we don't\nReally know [laughter]\n\n\n\n\nThese people are on well it's\nNot just that I think they're wrong that their ideas are bad that they would be destructive to the country where they could be implemented that's given there's something different now we're not arguing over what the top marginal tax\nRate should be with the left today we're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the focus of the fight is now the main effort the central argument\nHas to do with whether the last ... defeat\nWhether it can handle the fact that it's not always going to get its way and in fact the aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is where instinctive impulses lie\nThe end of the progressive left has become violent and dangerous an unreasonable and perpetually outraged it's just not going to lead to good things for any one\nThis is not going to lead to happy places for this country and I do fear it's only going to get worse because instead of learning from their losses\nThe excuse them with delusions\nInstead of recognizing that the American people are not in fact\nTheir side they take the position that they were cheat you see it was Russia or it was that big mean\nMeaning Mitch McConnell or it was some other thing that they conjure up to explain it was the electoral college now they say the very same people who for about a year and a half\nOf Trump's presidency have been saying he's undermined institutions he's destroying our institutions he's undermining our democracy they say this it's seared into Vermont those same people now openly proclaim we need to tear their system down because Kavanaugh was on the Supreme\nCourt we no longer can accept what their system produces for politics\n[noise]\nWe saw\nThe president said these are professional protesters paid by George Soros et cetera et cetera what what what who these people what was that\nA lot of them were were normal people who are mad we we hung out with a group from Alaska was very specifically talking to Lisa Murkowski um a lot of them are Native Americans which also playing into Lisa Murkowski decision\nThey actually felt a lot of respect for her because she brought them into their office um she had a real conversation with them and we also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hell we talked to one woman who works for ultraviolet was paid\nShe helps steer people in the right ways to be able to to confront were paid there were people who are paid by organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up staying\nSorrows operatives folks that's what she is she saying it without saying it but that is a fact I saw a very interesting tactic about this from the New York times over the weekend too which is that now to bring up that somebody is is paid and and they paid activist an\nAgitator is a better when you're screening if people in the hallway you're not really an active if you're an agitator you're you're there to cause problems you're not there to solve anything or raise awareness you were there to ACT UP right but these these editors who are paid by Soros now when you bring that up the New York times at least one of us reporters were saying\nThat that is an anti Semitic dog whistle keep in mind that you're just stating a fact that it's a ... organization he is the funds behind it and they are paid by him but now to even say that they're trying to shut that down by saying oh it's anti Semitic so when I see it and tell you that\nSo I was like I said when they have on people with the ... he made science and they're down on Capitol Hill and they want to make sure that democracy is imploding from within and they want to smear the Kavanaugh ...\nThat that is apparently now not allowed any more you you're not allowed to point out that the that that storms this funding people\nThey're trying to claim that that is inherently admitted meanwhile if Tom's dire was wanting them disorders would you would be just as quick to point that it doesn't matter what you're saying that they're getting paid these aren't normal people normal people don't do this\nDon't do any of it by the way they don't show up at the screaming at the Capitol and acting like a bunch of maniacs\nTheir show and there's the leftist so angry over this\nAnd here's one theory as to as to why I have a lot of theories about this good knows that I've got three hours radio every night to talk to you about it\nOne of them is that I think\nThat the progressive left worries deep down somewhere they worry that we're not for the Supreme Court ah imprimatur or is it ... him from a chore [laughter]\nImprimatur on their policies and beliefs they couldn't make the argument themselves and they need a Supreme Court that will side with them because they\nHad to live with just making the case about this or that policy they worry not just that they could convince the American people but I think\nThey worry that they could even convince themselves\nThey need a super legislature in black robes to tell them that what they believe is right\n[noise] Ralph's they're shaking to the very core which is why they act out so [noise]\nChoosing an energy company raises Mae West hustle easy answer all of\nMore constellation dot com slash energy\nChoosing an energy company raises many questions you can make by electricity natural gas work smarter [noise]\nWorking I find the company to do business with the news the markets\nOptions [noise] millions of homes and businesses there's\nInterview me the fishes simple site the\nReputation the personal friends of mine and there'll be honest with you and if you go well I don't want to sell it that's fine you don't walk out but you can trust them seven won three four six four sixty eight sixty eight got an email from a friend their front door and been kicked him turned out it wasn't a very good front door\nThey didn't kick in a lot they actually kicked in the supposedly would portion of the door because our and our I don't lecture me just tell me about the people who major forged darn door and I did and he called him and now he's happy\nI Know for America bugs that is that\nKen's fans that ... what she told us and that she was sent that then we have that ... percent of the fence and that's kind of trade and when I look at the lack of fairly corroborating evidence including\nNo evidence from her very best friend who is president at\nParty I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her assailant\nTrying to have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and completely question story ... to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political cowardice on that is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist fake feminism\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said wait is that is the Hillary Clinton or no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department thought she was I'm sure she's friends with Clinton too\nBut notice how quickly they will just attack\nAttack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda\nRight away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermines the power structure\nIt's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were an apostate if you had been within the faith and left the hatred that much more because you are more of a danger because the faithful will see or departure and think why did that person go\nSame is true with radical leftist feminists they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh\nMaybe maybe\nWe need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second maybe I can think for myself to maybe there's something else here\nOn and there were there were some people who came through noxious Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props to already on the show there were others uh I I gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gambled with\nThe Kavanaugh nomination or by delaying it a week some would say though had he not delayed it they would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it's\nCertainly seemed like a a cowardly move at the time to me that said\nWhen push came to shove flake did the right thing here at the moment he had to do it so I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus either\nBut he deserves credit mansion in West Virginia also deserves some credit but let's also keep it real\nWest Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly in favor of Kavanaugh and against this obvious political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical leftist feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her\nTo threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help their\nCase and then that brings me to Murkowski now\nI don't know about wait wait before getting Murkowski Hi can I Hope I Hope that people in her home state deal a deal her quite a review for what she's already down five points\nUh but I really do hope that they manage to find a way to hold her accountable for what was an unbelievably lame decision um you know North Dakota in ... should oust high camp at the soon as possible moment\nAnd then that leaves us with Murkowski All right now Murkowski is not somebody who has ever been impressive to me at all and I'm not surprised that she she pulled distant and she's not up until twenty twenty or twenty twenty might be twenty twenty two\nUm she's not up for quite a while so her calculation is clearly she can massage this issue later on you know take some heat now and then and then she'll figure\nIt out or take less eating out really Mitchell figure it out later I Hope the American people are accountable um I Hope that the people of Alaska K. E. N. I. up in the house you're listening to the show alive I Know you guys up there in Anchorage give you a high five\nI Hope that you do everything you can to mobilize and make sure that she is at the soon as possible moment no longer\nWe would have a culture we have a system we make arguments we stand for our principles and we will make our case they stand for the you know I'm going to hold my breath and attack you with a stick if you don't agree with me\nAnd they won't even have these so called the dose of the Senate or in the media which you know media as much of cry babies but they wouldn't have them say that they shouldn't do that at least she just dodge the question the answer to this is like you know the answer to if somebody asks you if you're a God you say yes\nYou know maybe that's from the answer to if somebody or should somebody follow the person into a restaurant or harassment because of their politics answer that has no it is on or quickly without question\nNo but\nShe won't say it because she knows where she to say that\nIt would offend the less it would offend the activists the Emily run a cow skis and to Amy Schumer is and others who love to just pray and you know listen a lot of what the parade around and get arrested by the big mean police and the whole thing this is part of their political culture now\nThe shrill ... the nastiness the shrieking the anger the rage the\nThe public demonstrations of psychological distress that's a defining characteristic on the left now\nRight to have really a a nervous breakdown in public that is what left ism has become\nAnd you notice it here and this is we've had all these different examples you know your real Rand Paul have as well rather ... wife wrote a letter about\nHow not only was he attacked and ... almost beaten to death by a lunatic left wing or or who just hated Rand Paul or was it was not some you know labor dispute is hater Rand Paul attack and from behind them was killed him\nHe had pneumonia was terrible pain and that's after some lunatic left wing Bernie Sanders supporter tried to shoot Rand Paul on a baseball diamond in Alexandria a Hodgkinson James Hodgkinson the shooter so maybe you should know the left likes to forget it very conveniently\nUm but you know his wife wrote about how she gets threats her church child or children gets a get threats\nAnd prominent Democrats make jokes now they're in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about the attack on Rand Paul\nAs oh so how funny this is something cute that they should laugh about people are disgusted\nI keep saying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when their honor is lost\nIt can't be ... based because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problems when you're fighting against the left is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have nothing to begin with but you know Brian kill me\nIs a guy that I I don't I don't know Brian at work in the before\nI I Know everybody and conservative media at least by reputation if not knowing them through work Muslim or personally I Know everybody by reputation\nAnd Brian is universally considered a by everyone I've ever spoken to a really nice decent guy\nYou know whether you like his uh his owner persona or his analysis that that is a relative he's a nice guys are supposed to be a really good I don't know mumbling work them or the other people I could tell your good guy Brian I can only say you know I've heard is really nice guy and I've always been enjoyment or actually\nEven if he was let's just say he was in Olbermann level jackass which is not a let's just say he was\nHe would not deserve what happened to him over the weekend where he was shocked and harassed by a couple a left wing 'cause you know there are any other kind these days activists comedians here some of the audio from it play eight\nWhere'd you accused of sexually harassing\nEveryone on the only way\nNot on the news that they weren't just ... from the front right have you know what I mean if you want Donald Trump day or do felt this guy 'cause he's the only person in America that Donald Trump within [noise]\nTrying to get a criminal fritter go\nDown not\nOkay nobody got hurt and you think about what you're doing because you're doing about it\nNow I don't know those idiots are and what I can tell you when I say this and I say this knowing full well some point I might have to come on air and explain to you that\nYou know I got into a a a scuffle and a lot of these media types you know they\nThey think that there are you know impervious to this kind of thing to think that that's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with some a left wing hack following me into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy each different in the halls of the Senate it's different in a public space of public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference you waiting for waiting for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein in the whole the Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside the home\nThat's weird there are boundaries here but this goes even beyond that because not only was there the the\nAmbush interview component of this then there was the following him into the subway so that's really you know you're not just going up to somebody and they walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done\nThis is following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car publicly trying to humiliate him and then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway car\nWhat if somebody in the subway car you know who heard the prank you'll meet as a racist what if that person down and Brian space\nAnd would apply and you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if the Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt that's not a hard thing to create as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians\nOr creating a combustible situation they are creating a scenario in which you would not be difficult for there'd be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation\nThey don't mind that they're running that risk you start to think that maybe that's really what they're pushing for this is who the left has become they won't deny it they won't shut this down they won't call it out there are increasingly embracing not just the politics of public nervous breakdowns and acting\nLike psychosis who were slamming on the on the thirteenth on doors of the Supreme Court but also there's the left and the Democratic party are bracing the politics of east offers full rosters [noise]\nSaid private space [noise] Fridays [noise] and we're really trying to instigate by [noise] same\nIf you ever found yourself when

ceremonial swearing in for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh at the White House despite\nHarshly criticizing the left during his confirmation hearing justice Brett Kavanaugh pledges to play it down the middle\nReally matter that Lindsey Graham jumped him when he did the answers abs so ...\nIf ... ... and also this this storyline is pathetic more ironic story line about how Kavanaugh was ... and his response and so he's not he's not judge like even though he's been a judge brutal like over a decade and the D.C court of appeals\nHe wasn't being a judge when he was in front of the Senate he was being accused of of being a a predator and she was on the defense dance okay he was being treated like a a criminal even though it's a non criminal proceeding he wasn't being a judge human being treated like a criminal\nThe reason they're so upset though and that they would switch that narrative is that they thought they had him on the ropes they thought they were going to finish them off and Lindsey Graham along with cabin all rallied but this was close and I think that that\nGets lost in all this and it also was not without consequences I had the opportunity to speak to our buddy that\nGeorge Bush on rising that interview will be appearing tomorrow morning if you want to see it you go to heal the TV but I was able to speak about this little bit and he made some important points I'm One that\nIt's not like there are not consequences for cabinet that came from this Harvard said that he's no longer allowed to teach because they they will once again at the academy they caved to the leftist mob this is how they do things their place Thirteen\nTime particularly outraged at my colleagues and students a Harvard law school\nThose of them who have made it impossible for Kevin ought to continue to uh teach there it's rampant McCarthyism at its worst reminiscent of what I experience when I was a student at Brooklyn College in the fifties where professors were fired\nBecause it was suspected that they went Seventeen or Twenty years old they might have been a members or fellow travelers are the Communist Party which you have to put an end to that\nThat's right just has to stop\nGoes ditches corrosive to politics this degrades and your roads political discourse and as for the for the last you've ever been the ones trying to shame conservatives over Trump and his and his erasing of norms ... the hypocrisy years insane factors also spoke about that\nSpecifically about how how one of the primary things you see going on here with the way the left try to take down capital just how hypocritical thing is ...\nIt's a ... run rampant the constitution would not permit\nImpeachment of a sitting justice for actions he took while a private citizen thirty five years ago\nOr nor I think what it permit using the laws of perjury which are very tough to have to be about a material fact it has to have been a deliberate live not forgetful is not a motion not an exaggeration but it will full deliberate lie about a material facts\nI think that the Democrats are shooting themselves\nFor we ought to be moving forward let's judge justice Kavanaugh on his um performance as a justice of the Supreme\nCourt that's right\nLet's actually let's ... which doesn't even like having all the judge theirs was disagrees with his jurisprudence disagrees with a he disagrees with McConnell by the way is like a boss\nGotta give credit where it's due because I don't get too big high fives pull off your groceries disagrees with holding the Senate or or holding the Americans that had seen the Merrick Garland seat open\nWhich I Would not want to Gorsuch it's not this isn't even this isn't even the guard Lindsey but people still talk about that like they're keeping some kind of a scoreboard tally\nYou want to keep a scoreboard you know what you got to keep in mind the only reason Republicans were able to get through the justice is they they do right now

my theory on this because I spoke to president about this week's ago during that interview I've told you all about a bunch I I think that they're holding this for another week or two 'cause they know that when people see it when they finally see and this is look they're holding the truth and they're well within their rights to do it\n... and they're also doing what the other side as demanded which

are meant to protect the bureaucratic but of those involved\nThat's what's been redacted so far and there's no reason that I can see to continue to withhold this stuff unless they they're I think there's just a desperation on the left to keep\nIt out of the public light as long as possible that they don't know they don't have a better alternative than just delayed delayed delay his look we'll look at a drive with Kavanaugh even if they delayed the chances are of the Dems taking the Senate were\nPretty slim no matter what but their main game was delayed delayed delay\nJust try to wait for better times you know you never know what can happen you never know that was the idea once it's information comes out and we stayed there were ... off two main conclusions from is the five information and\nI'd like to see the full scope of the mother ... thinking about that we have not being told we the American people have not been told what has gone into the smaller probe in terms of what was authorized for investigation we've gotten a a version of it but not the full version the full version of it still classified\nIn fact so classify that when Mueller's team went in front of a federal judge I Believe was Emmett Sullivan they initially tried you hold information back from the federal judge like we can't tell you that he said I'm cleared for whatever you're going to tell me that\nSo we have so much we don't know when we finally get that information what will see is that this\nWas the rejection they've been lying to us which will even further damaged the credibility of the F beyond the deejay as non political organizations they were very politicized like it's a legacy of the Obama administration us Eric Holder for heaven sakes running to the OJ the legacy of the Obama administration\nThat this kind of behavior um went on the way that it did you know it's not surprising at all when you look at it in that context\nOf where you're gonna find that it's highly that that was all about covering up for for their mistakes and and for the politicization and that's why the hell and then you're also going to see that there was a they manufacture the pretext investigation to which I think will be the single most damaging thing once we have that in plain language in\nBlack and white in front of a sincere futile [noise] ah I really hope the American people hold the left and

know I I don't know\nI she is very possible she can be the single dumbest US Senator right now based on what I've seen of her last month or so but you know here's her position on whether there should be investigated or not\nPlay Seventeen D you view justice Brett Kavanaugh as a legitimate\nJustice he's going to be on the Supreme Court with a hitch talk to and I think after after ... and our

winded ramble and not accidentally say something that's correct but she managed to ruin managed\nBecause she's the dumbest person in the Senate everything that you said there was incorrect\nOr this notion that Kavanaugh showed partisanship let's never lose sight of what happened and what the Democrats did here and what a bunch of ... got her creatures the Democrats are and how low and unseemly and just just costing they are\nAbsolutely abhorrent I mean they are rotten\nThey put Kavanaugh in a position where they not only were accusing him of the flimsy is kinds of of uh in terms of evidence

them hey maybe I'm an Indian\nIsn't are ridiculous books I mean the left wants to lecture us about Trump and his decorum and his tweets and I'm hearing more and more from our swamp sources that they're the plan really is\nAs much as I'm hoping it's Hillary made as much as I'm hoping it's Hillary the plan is going to be Warren for twenty twenty maybe Warren and then a a a a veep ticket of either a Kamala Harris or maybe maybe Booker\nBut they really think it's going to be Warren and you know here's somebody who is entirely unremarkable in her career weren't not for racial fraud racial fraud you know if you will lie about the assets you have in the bank to get a loan to go to jail you know a lot of trouble prison federal prison\nAnd if you lie about that you get into a whole lot of trouble if you lie about\nYour race in order to get into a university or in this case to get a professorship at a at the most prestigious university\nReally at Harvard or Democrats as long as you told the line for them or are willing to excuse the whole thing I mean it it should it seem it's embarrassing and that's and then a lizard with Warren has now here's what's important about it to me well there's a lot of things\nBut here's what I won't let go she has never owned up to this she has never said if she came out and said you know what I disagree with our racial spoil system\nI did this knowing that I could get away with it because I don't believe that this is ethical you know but maybe she could claim but I also think I have enough but technically I caught technically a qualified no\nInstead she pulled this whole high cheekbones thing and then we're supposed to pretend that somebody went to law school at Rutgers I'm not putting Rutgers down but you don't go to law school at Rutgers may become a professor at Harvard law you just don't unless you have a special angle\nI didn't let you have something to help you through and she's never been forced to own up to this and the fact that the less I mean this is just like the NFL kneeling thing you know Trump is incredible at\nPicking means areas he he it really is like a political Sixth Sense that he has he knows that he can pick things that the less just get so fired up an energized about that they lose sight of whether it's a political winter for them or not\nAnd you know the NFL nearing for example the left thought oh and these different players who obviously or kneeling ah but the media narrative around this was over the players they thought that the players would went out and that all these teams would eventually allow kneeling and Trump kept poking at\nThis ... you know you guys better stand show\nBecause Trump understands that the end of the day a\nVast majority of the American people want respect to be shown some slack Moore show them that love football people want respect shown for the flag Trump knew that he understood that and when he refers to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas he knows that the left\nIs going to drop it oh my gosh she's being a racist why Pocahontas was a historical figure we all know from the Disney movie which was by the way not one of the better Disney movies out there uh I was very ... and I'm somebody who really liked the early Disney movies of that era you know Lion King I beauty and the beach to a great movie\nThe original or will be like it's not a radio but the old school\nRobin Hood where he's a Fox great it's a great cartoon of your kids haven't seen that one of my favorite cartoons cartoons used to be way better than they are now now there's a the cartoon they're making for kids these days\nBut he knows when he calls born Pocahontas they all go oh he's raised the jump on this but what what a lot of us who are just normal people who are not emotionally destabilized left is where we hear is\nWhy are they why are they defending\nElizabeth Warren being called ... where you know she's not a Native American right we all understand is so why do they act like this is some big slide against Native Americans the point is she's a fake she's a phoney\nAnd Pocahontas is a very well known female Native American in in our history you know there are others but Pocahontas was probably the most well known I mean you could say she's not the most historically significant I'm sure I'm about to get an angry email from somebody\nBy the era coordination and how it was a matriarchal society you know they were the basis for our U.S Constitution\nAnd who there were some really interesting were vision is out there about\nA native peoples in America and how both technologically and politically advance their societies where or when you have not mastered the wheel or writing it is tough to claim I think that the European columnist were shaking much of there\nA political system or you know I I you know you can call me crazy but but with the Warren thing are we calling her Pocahontas and you'll notice that one of the themes we're hitting on the show\nThe less deserves to be mocked what has to be ridiculed if they're taken seriously they ... when they're being on serious if they are taken seriously there's no way we ever snap them out of it\nOr they need to be mocked in ridiculed and and brought down a peg when they're acting this way on the in these positions on these areas because satire is a very powerful tool it's very powerful\nA there's a reason why we still know the names of people like\nSamuel Clemens Mark Twain why we know the names like ...\nBecause of their ... it was there to cure a cold powers but in in their writing that were show timeless and and really resonated with people\nAnd you you must be willing satirized people like was born must be going to point out the hypocrisy that the left has here and that that she's even being considered that she's being talked about by any one of the possible twenty twenty contender is just mind blowing [noise]\nIf your windows are hard to open and close our draftee or difficult to see out

president I'd states is something that you have emotional difficulty dealing with\nHe's in a fair to say that you're not very emotionally well adjusted\nIsn't it straight forward then to just point out that you got some growing up to do and you got some ... you got some fish as the kids would say to work through\n'em so I just want to know the core Ocasio Cortez who was a darling of the left now refers to left is in her district as people who are having a psychological breakdown because of Trump\nI I'm not reaching when I pointed out I'm not just basing it on their behavior and try to mock them all that's fun to hash tag on the lips it's also the case that they recognize that this is really that left ism is now a psychological disorder in the era of Trump\nAh but I wasn't even the the silliest or or weirdest things you said I got to tell you\nI've always there are some viral Internet clips uh that that are out there that you just never forget right there's the O'Reilly you know we'll do it live\nYou know we'll do it live I mean you know and you can say that to somebody and they knew exactly you can say those words will do it live and everybody knows exactly we're talking about I mean that clip is it's timeless truly great\nUh there's also the\nMath like such as the Iraq and the south Africa such as that\nYoung woman you know very beautiful young woman and sprayed oh in it and it was the Miss America pageant or think or miss team usa pageant or whatever it was\nAnd and she uh she got a little caught up in her answer and didn't really know what the heck she was saying and I know what that's like you know sometimes I've gotten really tired and and now I'm excusing the lovely young woman's ... of course right I'm excusing whatever um but I don't know if I caught myself\nBut Ocasio Cortez had a moment that reminds me of that I just wanted to play this for you there's so much here this was on MSNBC over the weekend this is the favorite new Congress Congress woman of the progressive left\nAnd here's the kind of stuff that she offers up in terms of her analysis of what's going on with the Congress this is gonna be delicious play clip on\nAnd you're also coming really as an outsider in a moment watching people like for watching what happened today and want to storm the gates and you're going to actually do that as well that's what's what's your plan [laughter] well\nI think a lot of them were changing our strategy around with that you know there's a lot of hype both awe and inside the beltway will use that term thrown around that\nThere are very ... organizers little Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if for some kind of strategy and what it is really about Oregon I Will\n[laughter] at work organizing south on some level of strategic in our options we bring together a strategy pressure on the ... it's the talk of only focus on a ... that's that's really interesting thoughts [laughter]\nJohn did you that's really interesting I Love crusade you jump through ... laughing [laughter] what are your resume that was straight out of the Mario Lopez playbook for that quip because he was like thank you very much ms Tennessee likes to lead to do this like deep voice announcer men thing after like such as Matt\nOcasio Cortez I mean that was John can you\nJump to the middle of that again just where she started talking about organizing could you do that because I I don't wanna hear the whole thing again I just want to hear the\nOh okay well close enough\nYeah it's like organizing is like like so what's different about organizers is with the organizing is that they organize and like outside the box and you know close the loop on the organizing of the organizational and there's like the Congress with the organizers and they're just like so much of that\nStuff [laughter] she was I mean John I'm not being unfair right and that was one of the craziest word salads I've ever heard on television\nI think she was trying to find what you wanted to say yes that's right because she couldn't get to a point as very astute analysis I mean she she comes out and you're thinking to yourself like okay I kinda know where she's going she's a community organizer she wants to borrow from the Obama playbook of you know community organizing isn't just a way of doing\nYou know agitation at public education in pursuit of personal political\nUh goals right it's not just whipping people up into in ... style mob there's something more to it than that but then she just gets lost and she's ... she's she's looking for the articulate soundbite that's programmed into her mind because so much a progressive ism is really this law\nOr the language of trigger warnings and like hierarchies of patriarchy and victim allergy and white privilege and checking your privilege and there's this whole other lingo and these phrases that come with it and she's looking for the ... you know she's looking to lock into that but she got a little lost and then you realize like she's not really thinking about what you're saying\nYou know this is like when Al Al Sharpton do this resists we much like the resist you know you realize he's reading off the prompt or but he's not actually thinking about the words that he sang Ocasio Cortez had is uh R. E. S. P. I. G. G.\nWe should keep that as a we should keep it as a drop job just to have for you know important moments like this R. E. S. P. I. C. T. that was one of my favorites uh anyway yeah ...\nRecord says this is the the great the great hope of progressive in this election is that she's a part of a crop of new insurgent left wing candidate who are pushing for a\n... openly advocating for socialism kids she defines socialism no but like she has an economics degree\nOr because you define marches know could you tell you much about marks or angles no\nBut she sounds right to the left and if you sound right and come from the rights group right the right identity group they give you a tremendous amount of difference and that's what you see happening here\nUh I I Would just note that my fear and I I Know I'm On this and I'm now I'm going to be banging the warning drawing this way in advance and you're like bar come on ... great unbelievable jobs numbers everything's going so well and I agree and that's because of Trump 'cause of the Republicans that are in charge\nNow ... and H I think it's gonna keep going for a while here is what I'm telling you though\nRight now we can mock these socialist and he's left is in the Democratic party because they sound foolish and we know their ideas are foolish and people are in a frame of mind where they will\nReason through it and understand you know anybody who is paying attention and knows anything you know are not limousine liberals and for people ... people for whom politics is really just an emotional game and it's all about virtue signaling they just want to talk about how they're\nYou know ... Marxist and redistributing wealth and everything 'cause it makes them feel good about themselves they don't think of the economic consequences my concern\nIs that we are going to have a structural economic reset because of the debt and because of the accumulation particularly of corporate debt load and you see that with all these these high you'll bonds that are ... and the corporate jet structures for some of these companies are never going to be able to actually make good on their obligations\nAnd Margot it's better than low energy Jeb I think it's the very top of the list\nCrooked Hillary as the all time best because I think that that was that maybe one in the election\nJust dumping her crooked Hillary 'cause it just got right to it that is her brand she is crooked Hillary you know I think it was incredible so I think what do you think John de Nang Dick number one it's not my favorite that's your favorite huh All right fine you know you're entitled what is your favorite I like crooked Hillary I think that's\nOkay All right I'll tell you I'll take that as yeah cricket Hillary's really good\n... crooked Hillary legit as nicknames go little market with low energy the fact that he called Jeb low energy I also thought was the basis of the time here's why does it look it's not just because I Love\n... Trump is is incredible content I mean the way that he gets up there and the way he tells stories and get that crowd engage the stuff that he says it sticks in your mind he's such a showman I mean he really is he's a world class performer\nA never mind the fact that he's now shown in an incredible leadership skills and and there I said political bravery you know he didn't have to do any does he was a billionaire he doesn't have to do any this I I Do think that bears reminding sometimes\nOr that we should at least take a moment step back and say you know he didn't he's not the Clintons he didn't do this to become rich she was already rich is doing this because this is what he thinks needs to happen for the country and this is real he is in fact doing public service all he's not the kind of guy who refers to as such\nBut each show important that there's somebody now who will mock and ridiculed uh left\nBecause there is a certain breed of conservative something you might even be thinking about you know some names that come to mind but there's a certain type of conservative that finds mocking the last to be beneath\nWe should get knocked all the time we should be called racist inbred hillbilly beer drinking NASCAR drivers you know because we're concerned right and and so they paint with a really broad brush and they just make fun of us you know we're all a bunch of Bible thumping races\nYou know middle aged white males that the Republican Party the left and they just hammer that culturally all the time and we're just supposed to take it\nYou know the old conservatism the kind of Weekly Standard conservatism that was dominant in our media discourse for a long time\nThat's faded away now it's not ... you're gonna make fun of us we're going to make fun of you know you're going there they made fun of Bush and said his eyes were too close together and he could use a Monica ones that have classes and he's an emphasis on all this stuff they did that for years and years\nPushing ever really hit back nobody in the UP really hit back McCain didn't really hit back Ronnie didn't really hit back\nWe actually need somebody who when ... when we see what the opposition is willing to do will will fight fire with fire these people are clowns polo seat and Booker and Feinstein and\nBlumenthal and just go to these people are jokers only it's not funny because they're really doing harm to the country and they're willing to destroy people into very dishonest\nThings in the process you know and they're delusional they deserve to be mocked they need to be ridiculed\nThey want to step in public life not just conservatives that need to sit there and take it and deal with this any more and that's this is important my friend okay [noise] ridiculing what should be ridiculed any [noise]\nProgressive left [noise] he's not just a little sweetener the Trump throws in their free speech is we need more of this we medium to own the lives\nWithin ... dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source calm score to visit\nThis flu season one longer instantly shot him make a world of difference so you can protect yourself and so you're close talking co workers helpfully fighting neighbors two month old niece [noise]\nDefinitely loving especially trained pharmacists but it provided over sixty million police chances to thousands and sign for your flu shot today with a zero dollar coffee with most insurance because protecting the world starts with protecting us [noise] ... [noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that\nI almost forgot to say everybody [noise] half indigenous people's day yeah hey\nOkay All right now now I Know this is also known as as Columbus Day right okay fine I I Know that people don't like to focus in on this too much because\nWho really cares about Columbus Day and the answer is I don't know not really me I don't even know it it's not even really a holiday like John do you feel like people to even have Columbus\nDay off work today off and my other job so yeah oh I'm Sorry ...\nI I used to the John you're the mad if you're you are the rock of Gibraltar of team hot man you are always always there for us\nYeah you know I I think that uh it it just for me it's just not a not a serious holiday you know it's not up there with a real holiday so I Can't get that energized about it but there was a little bit of a new story here because Columbus ohio\nWhere lots of fun things happened I'm sure they are not celebrating Columbus Day so they will not so the city is named for Christopher Columbus but they will not celebrate Columbus\nDay there instead celebrating indigenous people's day so I think to be consistent and John what do you think I think they should have to call it indigenous peoples town\nRight\nThey got to rename this is like when people in Austin, Texas want to change the street names and then I go wait a second we might have to change the name of our whole city Washington DC also has to change its name Washington D. C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm I live in Washington people were always like the state or you know DC\nYou know we should just call it D.C the district of Columbia shouldn't be Washington DC 'cause it gets confusing I Know that sacrilegious because our founding father blah blah but we got a state named after him and a lot of stuff named after him he's our dollar bill\nSo yeah Columbus doesn't call indigenous peoples anymore and I like to point out mostly because it upsets the left which is fun because we're we're owning lives were only lives hard these days folks freedom we embrace this because lives need to be known for their own good at this point\nThey they need people to show them that in in politics their ideology is that new level and they need to get wrecked\nNotice I'm dropping all the lingo John\nI used to know this stuff when I when I used to be playing video games I could use all the cool kids ... I was about to say you sound like a game or now yeah exactly I used to I got so good at ... I got it like this special level tournaments in fever I was playing kids in\nAll the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty it the fee for anyway I was like ten years ago\nSo Columbus Day people get all upset about because of the Columbus owned slaves and was a ...\nAnd to that I just point out oh why is it that we only judge and I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this because that period of in the history of the Fifteen sixteen centuries of particular interest to me you\nHad a massive Muslim slave trade going on\nIn the America so put that aside for a moment you had a huge slave trade and the Islamic world of white Christians I Would know they were being created a slaves all over the place a lot of them a labor to to guess work to death or the women were putting ... you can figure out what that was all about\nUm that was going on millions of people over the course of a few centuries and so it's not like it was just the slave trade in in Western Europe although we're always led to believe that but then you get into the Americas\nAnd you read a little bit about particularly the a Caribbean\nTribes or in you know native tribes and the as tech and into people's as well as all the tributary group", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "09"}
