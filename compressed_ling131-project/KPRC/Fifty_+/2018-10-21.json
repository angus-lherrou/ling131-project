appreciate it needs to get into Christian\n... courage us all to learn more about\nTechnology a nap you may not want to nap after this segment there'll be a little bit different I can assure you\nUh I count myself as as someone who needs a little jumpstart in the morning and get myself to the office without falling asleep at the wheel but my first stop here is\nPretty much always the kitchen to build a pot of coffee to tell you all and me why why that is a genius idea on my part I welcome Nell\nAreas Andrew cells buried to the show Andrews a cofounder of purity coffee and makes a strong case in favor of strong coffee welcome aboard Andrew\nThanks very much appreciate it get give us a quick story on how and why purity coffee came to be\nUm or give me the shortened version of the story um it was a a few years ago just thought it was three years ago with my wife was having some some health issues low energy and we really couldn't figure out what it was at the time but what she was doing is she was drinking a lot of coffee like most of us do I'm going to need a bit of energy\nAnd as you could probably ... a tea drinker and I thought that maybe I was doing was was back so I saw you know maybe one foot on accelerate said why don't put it on the brake and drinking just watch coffee ... so I'm I was introduced a tree professors at the Institute of coffee studies and found a bill university\nAnd what they told me was just amazing which is that there's a huge gap between what science knows and the general public knows about the health benefits of coffee\nAnd so that sort of started me down upon initially trying to find the very best coffee come alive when then off to was realizing what he was focusing every decision based on health and so we started working with\nThe University of Brazil and some of the leading ... coffee shop just looking at every step of the production chain saying what can we do differently if we would just making every decision based on how\nSo the the low hanging fruit on copies benefit is is it the caffeine helps us get our brains into gear right but is there is there such a a thing as you found out now as too much coffee in the morning\nWell the interesting thing what you said there is that the caffeine is only a small part of what country is made up of this thousands of constituents in coffee\nAnd the biggest constituent parts from caffeine is a thing called courage and the gas it's ... and what that is a horrible sounding name but it's a it's an antioxidants and that's the reason why most of the health benefits are coming from the antioxidants and coffee\nAnd not from the caffeine caffeine gives you that short joke we'll we'll like hum the loan so health benefits come from the ...\nWhat's good to have all of that in there then what about a ... back to that question I'm trying to pinpoint here how much is too much coffee or is there such a thing\nThere is a there is such a thing but it's really watching your body goes down to the caffeine parts of it is that\nWe we we metabolize caffeine in different ways I'm a foster metabolize caffeine and I could have doubled expressive before I go to sleep when I'm fine other people have a coffee at twelve o'clock and staying up all night so\nUm it's really watching your body and it's all about the caffeine that you're sensitive to but but when it comes to a ... or just a coffee this very low in ... the um the more the better it is actually dose dependent so if you're drinking a caffeinated coffee in our ... you have to what you buddy\nHow much caffeine content is there in at eight ounce cups and I'm guessing it varies widely from Brando Brandon right\nDoesn't actually surprised home they have all the things about things like the opposite ends very cynical widely uh from from kept a cop but apart from this one type of coffee\nCoffee called ... which is a lower end of the coffee chain um that's higher in in uh in caffeine but apart from that but we're in a sort of ten to Fifteen Percent range\nOkay and that's why a cup of coffee may taste different but as far as the the jolt you're going to get from is probably going to be about the same unless you're again go into like a double espresso or something\nYeah a lot of this as well what people say especially the chances of a sort of nervousness and that's the thing is not necessarily being\nOver cap and I often the case of just the fact those poor quality coffee with some of those those problems\nYeah that's a that's a very interesting take on that because everybody always assumes it's the caffeine now I read in the material Andrew that the coffee also can reduce the risk of some pretty serious\nDisease is talking about that for a minute\nAbsolutely and that that sort of um but most people are not aware of this the copies the number one source of antioxidants in the American diet\nWant to not jokes to the dogs that reduces inflammation in the body so there's been some very very large studies done on coffee and health and the one in particular which is one million one hundred nine thousand people\nFollowed with thirty is and it showing the benefits school reduction of type ... diabetes by around forty to forty five percent drink three to five cups of coffee a day which is\nYou know which is shocking given the fact that those you know eighty one million people pre diabetic and the U.S should be something that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fifty +", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
