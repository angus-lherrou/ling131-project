{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "That to an airport [noise] let me explain that at the airports there are two different areas of the commercial terminal where you fly out on the airlines and there's general aviation where private planes fly out\nAnd depending on the state now understand this go state by state difference but under federal law you are not prohibited from carrying a firearm in an airport you can tell you get to the security checkpoint the TSA checkpoint there\nNow you can't carry beyond that but you can carry up to that point you walk through true in most states some states they have a state law but not Michigan so these guys are at the general aviation not the commercial aviation side of things and they're open carried\nAnd therefore manager comes out and ask them if they're law enforcement and they said no we're not he said well you you guys can't concealed carry\nA in the airport is of course they're open carries anywhere and so uh Jason said where we told them that we could you said you're carrying his only prohibited and the sterile area Michigan says otherwise public ... airports are actually stretch of road tour really preempted which is cool you know races uh\nAirport mentioned have to call the sheriff's office to discuss it okay and they went on went out to their claims they're private airplanes and start fueling their planes and checking them they're gonna fly work instead of as I was during the pre flight on the bird he says I notice a deputy started walking out onto the ramp\nSince then I saw him talking with the airport manager for a few minutes then he came over a decade to come over\nThe deputy says that yeah we got the report and uh I left the airport manager know that it's perfectly legal\nSo the deputy and the pilots had a conversation and then the pilots got their planes and flew away that's the way it should happen it's gonna be the case in the older let's go away for real quickly Bruce it's in North Carolina a brochure up where did you find\nOut what's going to do and I was just calling there is the most intriguing new website on the Internet titled or dirt or report and it all over

ship or gun ownership that you see any way to do it and\nThen it won't have to kind of liberal live\nWell it's a it is certainly worth a look I'm going to go take a look at it and I appreciate the heads up on that roof I also was lifting um I don't listen to a lot of talk radio but I was listening the other day heard interesting description there should be able to demonstrate liberals and leftist you know a is basically liberals uh\nAs I remember basically was a they want the government to allow you to do a\nYou know to do things that are basically left is left us want the government to force you into a thought it was interesting difference a\nLeftist want the government to force you to to get in there so yeah Bruce appreciate the call a\nFascinating stuff going on now we have some new guns we're gonna talk about when we come back let's see we have an eleven were under twenty two and Oh yes we have\nA ten millimeter that we have to talk about because I'm not quite of time

some of these guns or we've got\nThat out we were able to shoot those would have a ball that lots of cool stuff and there'll be even more coming out next week or so and I'll be able to explain that

whether it be was first job was it really but yet not many people were buying this was in the early ... it was only for whether federal first major coffee [noise] oh\nYeah yeah it otherwise you had them and this was you know this was even when I think even one Bob ... wrote this book and Seventy seven you mostly had\nSure either here's a question for you or I mean the big book of gun got to it says more stuff about hand loading in hunting rifles and this is not like long range competition rifles this is a hunting rifle but the two is kind of\nMerged hunting rifles are really incorporating a lot of the stuff that we have learned and advancement we've picked up from the long range shooting a competition world\nExactly ... and ... and he said for even getting a bullets at our boat credibly high ballistic called Fisher um target or controlled expansion so we're getting in some ways the best of both worlds especially for people who aren't more\nSo the question now is and this is the million dollar question is there a reason to handle it anymore\n[noise] in many ways not especially if it's one of the reasons the six point five ... ... ... you can buy really really accurate factory ammunition boat for match I mean it doesn't cost us much\nAnd I hope you know who are at low down even longtime loaders\nYes ... exactly I mean basically I have not pool to a handle on a ...\nFor a number of years now because I just look at and go man\nThe factory animal is so good you know yes the bones are better but the other thing is six Thirty years ago if you want it or something it was going to shoot a half inch you had him now there are probably a half a dozen or does it manufactures animal makers who will sell you boxes of and more than a few half inch\nOh yeah and often factory rifles really inexpensive factory\nRight mhm it's it's kind of queasy\nNominal yeah yeah it's very different the will be open about eight or\n... All right so as we look at the world now that we're in one of the big changes and I was going to get you to talk about this Mac some years ago if you weren't a flat shooting rifle you just went with more and more velocity 'cause that was and so we were we were all about building magnet rooms and big you know allowed and ... and all of that [noise]\nNot necessary anymore is it\nNo no it's not necessary anymore I Do a lot of a lot of under still believe it should be here long range they think of high velocity\nWhen the high BC bullets uh you don't need it does it it may not even flat cartridges may not quite as far as the old the hive last archery but because we had range fighters we can compensate for the range sites\nAnd I will yes\nWell actually the truth there is no the reason we wanted flat shooting carts distance because we were guessing at the range\nIs that we didn't know what the range but we were using all sorts of things like estimating football fields here to the nearest town or an adult\nAnd right are are two lines and the scope and you were supposed to put it on the back in the belly of a critter and hope that the standard size critter\nIn your ... good luck with that that's kind of like that where money's hundred yard that\nShit got a football field but it it still wasn't ...\nExactly so now you've got a six point five it's huge flat enough hits hard enough and the real key is can you put it on targets of what's happened to help us put bullets on target\nSam's holding course offerings will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found within qualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of\nQuestion time Gretchen gotten John [noise]\nWho I forgot to mention\nWas talking about the new Springfield Armory ex DM intended it let me do they have to do two different models the five to five competition model and the four and a half an inch slide\nA more of a carry guns ramp riverside but I just discovered this Springfield has a deal going right now one of those promotions they do occasionally very rarely actually\nIf you buy any I think it's any extra him in ... pistol like for the next month\nYou can get three additional magazines plus a pistol back so the let's see if I remember the strike the five to five miles comes with three magazines\nAnd the four and a half inch slide comes with two magazines either one you buy but then you can send in your neighborhood your ah information on it you're apply for this package deal and you get three free magazines that's that's like real money when I don't know\nIf you know I don't know if it would feed wonder if you could maybe give it a some kind of after market barrel and spring and she's forty seven it\nNo I don't know why you'd want to do that have no idea that just a weird stuff we think up by the way big announcement from a Ruger on friday this past week a write off the bat ... announced that they are creating first ever Ruger custom shop\nThere will be a Ruger customs shop or they're gonna crank out you know we're Smith wasn't that the foreign center uh other gun makers have had customs shops\nRuger it's going to have the customs shop and they're going to crank out special models of guns\nAnd along with the news of the custom shop became news of two new gun the first ones out of the customs shop one is an SRA ...

Do yes okay [noise]\nWhat what more probably happening how\nHow big is the target you're shooting at a hundred yards 'cause probably years going right over the top of it\nIt's a ... foot by three foot surely target\nMm shouldn't it shouldn't be off paper because two inches at a fifty and twenty five yards should be\nA eight inches all at a hundred yard just before times deal [noise] ah try exciting it is so you were absolutely on at twenty five yards that's going to put you still three two to three inches high\nA hundred yards\nSo my guess is you're still going over the paper right now\nOK okay here's the other thing do you have the ability to arrange to try ... started twenty five and moved to target to fifty and then back to a hundred ...\nTry that and make sure you're still on paper fifty and if you need to do an interim adjustment to justice so you're absolutely dead on at fifty and then take it out and make sure you're dead on a hundred and now you could put it wherever you want probably with a three oh wait where do you like it like two inches high in a hundred yards something like that\n[noise] I've actually always just done get on it a hundred it's my mountain than heavy what's hunting rifle\nOkay well then you ... if you're a dead on it a hundred you've got to be shooting he's an inch or two low at twenty five yards something like that would be my guess\nThey try\nTo try that we're going to be the more Tex Mex good scopes and it should work or if it's if you're able to dial it in at twenty five you can dial it in a hundred I think you're just all paper right now\nOkay All right we're looking ... and let me know how it works out but yeah I got that that is good am are you working with good animal there so were let me know what I'll leave I don't go

K.\nFirst one is what we would refer to as a transferable machine got it can be transferred to any body\nWho could ... who could legally buy a pistol okay you have to be Twenty one you have to not be a convicted felon you do have to live in a state that allows you to own a machine gun I mean there are number of states you probably could guess them\nThat don't allow you don't own a machine gun fortunately Louisiana swamp it does [noise] um [noise] anyway the transferable guns\nAre are freely transferable that rare but freely transferable they're also there for the most expensive\nA gun that has been brought in after Nineteen sixty eight\nBut before Nineteen eighty six is typically either owned by dealer as a dealer sample\nOr by police department now the dealer samples during that time can be freely transferred between dealers okay that can't be transferred to an ordinary a consumer\nBut they can be transferred between dealers the final type of gun\nIs one that was a\nBrought into the country and registered after Nineteen eighty six after May of Nineteen eighty six and those are restricted guns and they are restricted\nOnly to the military police and\nA dealer who can get a letter from my law enforcement agency requesting a demonstration of that got chosen\nThat runs through the what would be roughly the prices of these three guns in the market because if you if more people can own it then it becomes more valuable that would be the pre sixty eight right\nThe pre sixty eight guns you're probably depending on the model in the condition probably looking at twenty thousand dollars or maybe it maybe more depending on what it is I mean if it's a cult Thompson it maybe twice that\nUm the uh what we refer to as the pre sampled guns the guns that were imported and register between sixty eight in eighty six those run about half of what a transfer of ... so call it ten maybe twelve thousand dollars\nA final category are typically only work the some of their parks a thousand bucks because Thompson parks have have value to them but not really any kind of big money\nIs no I think when you talk about three guys three consecutive Sarah numbers could be worth twenty thousand could be worth ten thousand could be the worst one thousand\n[noise] it depends on the paperwork and if if you were possessing the gun with their own type of paperwork that could be worth like ten years\nI'm\nSure it that way 'cause it would be contraband for a person to possess it who does not either\nA habit transferred to them on the proper form okay in the in the case for transferable or for a non dealer\nTo possess either of the dealer sample guts now I Need to throw a caviar out there that the person who is a dealer who owns dealer samples better pre Nineteen eighty six\nIf he gives up his license can keep those Taylor samples that's another reason why they're they have good value\nYour guy they hold on to say 'cause I got to take a quick work you're going to

and counter you just gave me a ... you just gave me a half a glass here\nOf cops and these are what ... ... this popular ... very okay especially among the idea is that what that was one that sold out because everyone wanted it last year I'm getting notes pining this fruiting is floral little ... very credible now these kind of like little pellets is that how they're grown or they created in ... they're they're grown and\nThese little cones but pellets are easier to transport because an ounce of of a holy hops can actually go out a lot quicker and there's it's about you know a lot larger so they they they just pulverized them and put them through an expert or that and put some of the ... gotcha so this is an assistant in even in about them all to\nThis is what gives the beer a lot of flavor a lot of the various tasting notes whether it's real happy those bitterness units or the other case that you would get on the ballot right now we go to showing show the beer is boiled for just about an hour and you're adding hops throughout your adding the hops okay then you go to\nShowing now as I say about earlier or with the hops the when you add them changes whether you to go to get better and it's from it aroma from it or a flavor from it so if it takes you an hour or two hours to chill down all those Roma hops he put in have been in hot water for long enough where they were comparing hops so the quicker you can chill it\nThe more you can retain the flavors that you want also the less chance for infection you have\nArt and below eighty degrees ... what's the rough temperature each on it I I usually go for about Seventy five Seventy five yeah if it's too high you're going to kill the uses to cold is going to keep these to sleep you got to your friends you you will you want to make the environment for them really uh I'm\nHappy well it comes to beer obese does your does your friend not ... not an easy thing though however are still the next thing is pitching the use of life to you\nThis is where it becomes clear ... well yeah that a living thing I mean east is is is a beautiful thing and you can make alcohol you can make CEO to show me it's just this is where the the life comes to come and there are different types of east there are there's different\nDifferent strain yes range from different regions and they have different quality you know qualities each each one might produce same with water water water in the east or or um you know related to the regions that come from [noise] okay so then you pitched to used and how long is the only time after you've cool\nDown sanitation is a very key okay you don't want to infections of other bacteria is a wild geese this where you can get really bad off flavors so once you show that you sanitize everything that's going to touch your beer at this point is still considered ward until east is added but\nSanitation is absolutely key okay so your pitch the east then what happens stepping you close it in ... in the form enter and you add an air lock or a year yeah you you should have been drinking the whole sort of a threat\nFor you make it so that and I think he'd get into it so there's blow off to basically or an airline which just lets the CEO to the east is creating come out but nothing coming\nOkay so fermentation how long\nAbout a month a month so basically you you when you pitch the ... you then are you're putting the east into a new container into the ferment ended up from mentor gotcha so you take the work World War\nThat has the hops you show us down and you put it into the for mentor along with the used for thirty days now difference between a logger and a nail involves the field\nBack temperature temperature temperature um luxury east typically ferment around fifty five degrees and alleys typically from EPA tweens sixty two to Seventy two degrees and one of the top fermenting and the other's bottom from it for the most probably for the most\nPart okay gotcha so thirty days is now going by now I'm looking here you've got beer ales sixty two to Seventy two degrees two to three weeks logger fifty five sixty degrees two to three weeks\nNow the term logger actually log during is aging and cold temperature ... a logger you'd ferment at fifty five fifty fifty seven for two or three weeks and then you would log or it for up to three months and that's actually the process of law governing is about thirty five degrees and you maintain that for\nFor two or three months and actually clear to flavor it clears the beer out for clarity\nSo loggers or longer ales about thirty to absolutely ... require a ... a lot more patience to correct so thirty days have gone by with your ... your ... now what do you do comes out of the perimeter\nSo you put it into another container that's also sterilized or you as a set amount of sugar and then you read what now a set amount of sugar a landing on how much carbon ... so this is this part of the east so alive okay so you put it another bucket you add sugar\nAnd then you put it into each bottle and kept it okay and what that sugar to the east will eat that sugar inside the bottle and creating a C. O. two okay and it'll naturally car really carbonate inside of the bottom [noise] All right and then you wait about two weeks there's even a week and a half and putting your fridge and you enjoy your

conversation here one of the things a lot of us have been well frankly honestly smiling about for about a week now would be ... there is a justice Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court the battle was\nContent just mean nasty slimy ugly and probably ultimately be helpful to the G O P\nAnd motivating an awful lot of people to vote who may have kind of slipped through the midterms by the Twenty one days from today Twenty one days when do they do not voting shame on you get off your rear end getting gear simple as that so what is going to mean to us that Brett Kavanaugh\nIs on the Supreme Court there are some cases that are headed toward the Supreme Court and some that probably will get their journey to talk about that and kind of this plot the subtle but Jean Hoffman a from Cal guns or hey gene\n[laughter] I don't know about you I've been smiling for about a week now\n[laughter] absolutely but I still want to see these sort of see what I Want to see the dishes granted I was yeah we're actually\n... ... exactly ... or ... one of the things that are I guess just to cover very quickly when cases a request search your you search uh basically they asked the Supreme Court to accept them it takes four votes to be accepted obviously takes five votes to win\nIn the past on a lot of important Sacramento cases have been turned down by the Supreme Court they somebody would not even accept them\n... we don't exactly know why but the thinking is maybe internally they said you know we're not going to have the five votes to win it's let's not take it at this level and make it a precedent the Supreme Court precedent let's just not even take the case\nThat OK well run the math for us now I mean is it really fine for or are we now look that up for four plus Roberts as a swing we still don't know what's going on with him\nYou know I'm worried it may be the kind of internal conversation about how we kind of just five was always a question of whether it was Kennedy or Roberts who was the person who you know what they're saying yes that these cases had real interest I mean\nSome of these cases that weren't granted I had a Thomas writing sent saying we're treating the second month like second class right\nRight so you know the first thing to see is whether or not we're dealing with chief walking secret court you know out of certain political arenas um you know ... one of the potential negatives of his adult for this\nComing for is that it may make she wants to wait forty [noise]\nOh I see to let it settled down to say some people say well see now this is what that was it was all about Missouri Supreme Court the second amendment and guns and all and he said look let's just let it settled for a while ...\nYeah and unfortunately opposite that's really that's not the case but it is the risk but we certainly you know how or solid votes at all it's like\nOkay ... ... if you would run through a few of the cases that either are you know already been appeal to the Supreme Court are headed that way logically and you know because there's some really important ones out there\nBut it's it's it's basically when it matters I'm white now sitting in front of them is um California and gun roster where they can make it so you can't sell a new maker my oldest firearm\nAnd gun in California that singing in front of them also a mass out of Texas where people from DC we're trying to buy\nFirearms from Texas dealer like they could buy rifles\nAnd that was that returned to buy the circuit that's now but the ones that are I think\nEven more critical um you have magazine vans are both from the east coast here in California\nThose cases are likely to work quickly as we California they've been on Nellie and join or the other things that are out there I'm In California you know we kind of famously warned them then overturned on ... that the state scary and somewhat\n... that is well not granted served eight on it and it younger ... Hawaii or the panel said well you know I don't care you don't have right Gary so it must be going Hawaii\nUm we took that to be overturned on ... but that's again pretty hairy where Supreme Court order\nYou know I'd like to return to that first case because I'm not sure that people outside of California fully appreciate what the hand gun lost her is\nAnd how it has been corrupted now there is a foregone to be able to be sold at a dealership in California\nThe state has to approve the specific model of the gun has to be a submitted by the manufacturer and then put on the list of not unsafe\nGot which I Love right not unsafe cuts so in other words you can see all these guys you can buy these goods and then several years ago they said yes and one of the things these guys are all going to have to have this micro stamping\nAt which point the manufacturers said yeah except that it doesn't exist we can't yet micro stamp\nSo when a gun falls off the list and anytime you manufacture changes something in a God it falls off the list and it's required to be re submitted except now you can't we submitted anything because nothing has microscopic how to undo\nThat's ... that's exactly right I mean and and the way to make it very practical California generation or clock illegal to sell in California\nIt is to go through the entire cycle it really yeah I don't know about the ... is a lot of the last five years they aren't that much of a burden all they need to get more and more to earn it just\nMakes sense so [noise] you know and I know you you have your fingers out there you're talking to a lot of the key people all the civil rights lawyers who are working on Second Amendment stuff\nWhat are they saying in terms of what's the game plan now but the Supreme Court has changed\nWell I think you know the answer is we want to get as many of these strong challenges in front of the Supreme Court and in some ways tried to bring them with the challenges that they are less radioactive a\nMagazine like California I ski legally can magazine so in that kind of level with headlines scream court does not look out of out of ... out of touch by saying of course the state government property from people that's protected by the ...\nRight right okay so basically they're they're working on it and now they're looking at which are the ones that are most likely to go through to be successful you know and they build their case to start building it says like building blocks they start and then the building that perfect\n... and we now have you want to see things very which is you know there were arguable whether Illinois Jerry ... weapons but it is very clear\nThe streak which DC was worried about ...\n... thank you so much I appreciate it more than you know how it was a pleasure having you here\nAnd we will get you back on soon because this is ... were open lines for you now eight six six gun range reports are welcome as are pretty much anything else if it's on your mind we have an open line for you just give me a call that Tom Sawyer gosh [noise]\n\n\nDamn three point eight compact Springfield Armor\nThis audio is for your review for ...

only for whether federal first major company\n[noise] oh yeah yeah it otherwise you had them and this was you know this was even when I think even one Bob bagel wrote a book and Seventy Seventy mostly it\nSure are so here's a question for you or I mean the big book of gun got to it says more stuff about hand loading and hunting rifles and this is not like long range competition right 'cause this is a hunting rifle but the two is kind of\nMerged hunting rifles or really incorporating a lot of the stuff that we have learned and advance much we picked up from the long range shooting a competition world\nExactly and we were well these days we're getting a bullets better vote credibly high ballistic called Fisher I'm part or controlled expansion so we're getting in some ways that's of both worlds especially for people\nMore and open\nSo the question now is and this is the million dollar question is there a reason to handle it anymore\n[noise] in many ways not especially if it's one of the reasons the six point five ... ... you can buy really really accurate factory ammunition both for match I mean it doesn't cost us much\nAnd I hope you are at low down even longtime loaders\nYes ... exactly I mean basically I have not pool to a handle on a ...\nFor a number of years now because I just look at and go man the factory animal is so good you know yes the bones are better\nBut the other thing is back Thirty years ago if you want to do something it was going to shoot a half inch you had him right now there are probably a half a dozen or does it manufactures animal makers who will sell you boxes of animal they don't you half inch\nOh yes and often factory rifles really inexpensive factory\nRight mhm it's it's it's kind of queasy nominal yeah yeah it's very different the world that we grew up in about eight over ...\nAll right so as we look at the world now that we're in one of the big changes and I was going to get you talking about this Mac some years ago if you weren't a flat shooting rifle you just went with more and more velocity 'cause that was and so we were we were all about building magnet rooms and big you know allowed and ... and all of that\nAre not necessary anymore is it\nNo no it's not necessary anymore I Do a lot of a lot hotter still believe it should be here long range they think of high velocity\nWhen the high BC bullets uh you don't need it does it you may not even flat cartridges may not quite as far as the old the hype last archery but because we had range fighters we can compensate for the range sites\nAnd I will yes well\nActually the truth there is no the reason we wanted flat shooting carts distance because we were guessing at the range\nIs that we didn't know what the range was we were using all sorts of things like estimating football fields here to the nearest town or an adult\nAnd write or two lines and the scope and you were supposed to be on the back in the belly of a critter and hope that the standard size critter\nIn your ... good luck with that that's kind of like that one hundred years now to\nShed that people that got a football field but it it still wasn't as precise as a laser\n... exactly so now you've got a six point five ... enough hits hard enough and the real key is can you put it on targets what's happened to help us put bullets on target\n[noise] well one of the biggest advantage of high ballistic coal fishing boss is not so much they shoot flatter but they retain more energy which helps a little bit but to take trips left and I went\n... and so you get that saying we still have to guess make to a certain extent I used to ride the electronic uh ... your pocket but\nAh each ... each each can't get a precise idea of wind like you can range\nAnd it's like well yeah you know we knew that\nUntil we can get our when doping drone that we've seen downrange\n[laughter] not know\nOh my gosh you gotta know somebody is doing that right now right\nWhere most of these ... that take place but yeah but I think that you had a big advantage\nOf even these moderate philosophy a Partridge just like the ... ... if you make a little error they in the wind estimation they kind of make they prevent you from screwing up too much\n[noise] All right let's just a practical uh\nExample if you had a condition where a bullet from Thirty years ago would drift\nTen inches to the one side the guy who's going to drift in it just and you use a high BC bullet deaf today and it's going to drift five inches a basically one can miss or ruined a critter and the other one get you the hit that you know now you're just sharpening knife\n... provide even even a like a small error prone outlook as by Larry cited appalling\nEaten exactly that\nBullet in that age ... much easier with hobbies you know\nOkay we've kind of talked around this thing was the yeah maybe you know a lot of people don't need to him load but why would you handle wide well more specifically why do you handle it and what do you do with your stuff when your hand learning\n[noise] [noise] well I Am a little part of his job but I also still really enjoy it a theater stumped still it's the only way to use some of the new bullets ah because they don't come in a factory right a French us right now\nI'm working with well actually it's a factory I've been working recently with six point five PR seat which is a slightly bigger\nRight but it's a brand new and it's there's not that many loads available is you know you get Horner the of course\nYeah yeah and it will become more popular I'm sure that\nI had to do I have to have loading art on it and I had a gun I had a gun re barrel and I wanted to use various so that was one reason I hand load and I also found some really accurate combination that I wasn't I got there the hearty ammo it's fantastic yeah\nBut I eat it a little by little bit my hand last up whether this makes any difference when you shoot some sizeable volleyball I don't know uh it\nIt can give you bragging rights when the shooting with your buddy I guess that would be the other thing handler can still allows you to find junior load to that specific rifle and get the very best out of it\nYeah and and yeah and when your index it with what you're sitting around talking ... buddies and you've got some very\nThat's why I said well I use forty grains of a four sixty four and that
