they've got a cool deal rather yeah\nYou can read the temperature got phenomena built in so with my remote at my phone I can see what the temperature is inside and outside got cameras inside it's gotten alert system on it and I could set of sorts temperature goes below a certain number and I set it up would ever want to be\nI get an alert and I know that something is happening the powers going out to eat is gone and what about the power but the heat has gone out and the cabins getting too cold\nWhich could end up freezing the pipes I could call it they would have to go take a look at\nIt just one of the interesting side benefits I guess because you you get the camera system for security you weren't able to see if there's somebody snooping around your house you get these alerts on your phone and you get little video you could see what's going on you could punch you in and watch a live video anytime you want it saves clips for you\nI mean that's the older you want this alert before something happens if somebody has outside your house to get one which is ... doing\n... imagine if you had your family inside your way you could call them and say there's somebody outside you guys you know and he has some instructions for the call nine one one whatever\nUh at the same time there are these other benefits whether it's seeing if somebody's left package for you a finding out if there's critters walk around and I certainly do that as well\nI got to tell you I Love this system is just the coolest thing there's a lot of the cameras there real simple to set up their work off the Internet to work up go right to your phone you got a phone app which is simple as that can be now a blink gives ... or Amazon company\nIt works with Alexa of course uh you can get free bleak cameras for way less than what the other guys charging to get an extra Fifteen Percent off for being a gun talk Lester just go to ... protect dot com slash gun talk that's blink protect dot com slash gun talk\nUh it's cool stuff [noise] [noise] I'm looking at getting ready for I'm going to be deer hunting end of next week getting almost effort gotten a rifle uh got my aunt ... outside of the and it's interesting I went with a scope that might surprise people\nMight be hunting in a Idaho hung out west there so long distances and I have a scope at the top magnification ours is six power\nPeople out there using your four to ... for to sixteen power were lots of magnification here I Am popping out six power what's that about well I can remember when everybody handed out west of the fix for power scope that was the deal\nIf you've never tried it here's something fun to do to try which are cool scope senators for power if you have a chance to shoot out at three or four hundred yards and do some shooting I think you may be surprised if you're used to crank it way up high magnification you'll say well look small okay so what\nIt doesn't matter where it looks like can you hear what you're aiming at\nAnd you're gonna find that four or five or six power hitting a deer at three or four hundred yards is just not difficult\nWhy would you well you probably heard me say for a long time I have a real fan of the scopes that are in the low magnification range one to five two to six that level why is that well depending on where you are\nAnd if you're an area where you're like walking through the woods keep it on the lowest power\nThat way if a deer jumps up right in front of you could throw that rifle lucky both eyes open and one more than half or two power you can basically it's it's as fast as it can be it's as fast as I read that it's crazy how fast it is now if you had at cranked up to six power eight power nine power no forget about not going to happen\nSo basically I keep my scope from the lowest power\nUntil I Need more power so I mean some things out there at three or four hundred yards as many of time\nTo crank scope up that's what I Do [noise] so just kind of a thought for hunters uh ... if you got to freedom I keep it on the bridge [noise]\nYou'll find you'll have plenty of time it's way out there [noise] and if you don't have time to get three or how you can still maybe three or four hundred yards trust me on this it's just a lot easier than you think our number is eight six six talk gunpoint you take it into the woods this year [noise] and are you

S. versus United States\nIt's actually ha I guess I'm starting to ... and you're right I see why you're right I'm Sorry I Apologize and go ...\nSome nail is is\nYou cannot hold criminals legally responsible in other words you can't prosecute them for noncompliance with any little gun control law you come up with because that violates their Fifth Amendment right against self recrimination\nSpecifically you cannot require a criminal to register his gun because their registration of it would be admitting\nThat he's not not allowed to own it\nSo that would be south in combination in this case in this Nineteen sixty eight case it with somebody with a ... a a prohibited something you'd have to register under the national firearms act got prosecuted and of course this will actually if you if he were to register it\nThen that would expose him as a criminal and that self incriminate nation and we have a law that says you can't require somebody to incriminate himself so no\nRegister gun registration laws do not apply to criminals and when they say to people that it's like their heads explored\nYeah that's also why you hear about a only use the stereotype Chicago ... gets busted with an A. K. and they say in Chicago you can't have that but what are they charging with felon in possession they don't say oh you violated the anti gun laws no no no no you're a felon in possession\nBecause the cops and the da's office no we try to do it for this\nAll his lawyer that they have them there goes that\nYeah it it is an interesting thing when people are saying well you know we need to register guns in there were so are you do understand that you cannot require felons people who are prohibited from owning a gun to register their guns is your work\nSo that really the only people you want to require to register guns are law abiding people that tend to stop ... and they go well no that's not right then you go well I'm just telling you hang versus us Nineteen sixty eight\nIt says that itself in combination to require someone who can own a gun to register a gun\nAnd so you can't require that so the bottom line on it is that gun registration laws apply all new to the law abiding and then their heads go just spinning around like Linda Blair and The Exorcist\nTo handle the people that say well I don't believe that just look at it you don't have to tell them to look up to say do you know a lawyer or a cop that they say yeah say at them\nUm you know you you have to support the brand with marketing and digital ads and\nUm you know I think just the the amount of money that you're going to need to spend to sell your beer has increased um so if if you plan on taking that approach um you'd better be well capitalized\nUm you know I think a third leave you should have a really strong tap room and you should be um you know in an area where there is some foot traffic or at least\nBeing an area where people can easily access to 'em I think that because there are so many breweries out there now and because so many more breweries have opened up\nEither satellite tap rooms or places to experience the brand in you know within a city\n[noise] um the days of sort of being in an industrial park you know thirty miles outside of a\nA major hub in you know expecting that people will travel there every single day or every single weekend um I think that you know those days are sort of fleeting as well unless you have something really really special you know that they can't get anywhere else um so I think those would be the things that I Would look at\nAll right we will

that required for a firearm action and so we called the action part go walk\nAnd from that we get the in the English idiom the phrase to lock stock and barrel which means the action to stock and

actually look at our weapons are historic so they could\nGet you know completely for average day I still are my age or something even when you watch the trailer we've come out very odd but they do let me in a in the show they make a firearm\nA but then they make what lot fire will different types of combination weapon but uh sometimes they'll have the barrel the inside of the barrel gorgeous back an air car into what they're making putting together ... down there doing a lot of work on these weapons\nSounds like you've lined up some really a top level crafts men or are there any women ...\nThey're they're the one that on the show uh the guy that was pretty amazing got on the show it\nIt really impressive because I'm a total book nerd [laughter]\nHi one of the things I decided when I became I was that I wanted to know how that fire for you know the ... one of the ... that\nIt's on how to shoot a historic at modern got as I've always kind of practical application to my study of history but I had in that it can't really make a lot of early left out that getting to watch these ... men and if you ... at age they gather it's\nAround them but never really\nYou know her father took her out and talk about guns a little bit just give her name bury him [noise] but ah but never ... but you know she always wanted to go hunting and things like that but she never really push the subject and her father never pushed on her and uh so now yeah now she's one of the bird hunting with me she wants to learn about deer hunting\nUm she just died of an ad and then really love the\nOne

smiled real big and I like it teach\nAnymore [laughter] so\nShe's um she's five three um six one am I going to do that are very well at all nope nope but um but ah but I did tell her like you know will ah Oregon do different stock because I actually just remember like college about the ... off the beat the Ninety nine I chose the BP\nSo I uh got it so now my old trapped gun I'm I'm probably going to be finding a shorter stuck there for her\nAll right I'm going to make a suggestion to think about pets okay remember that just putting a short stock on it doesn't do it\nFor a number of reasons ah one is that\nThe barrels maybe longer maybe a little heavy a look at the percentage of weight of a gun I'd want to be your guns versus your weight and then versus her weight imagine using that percentage on you so you may be carrying a twelve or sixteen pounds gun same percentage of weight\nSo that's something to think about another is if she's shooting off the left shoulder\nTrying to get a gun suited to hurry will make all the difference in the rural for shot guns and then the August ... pistol shootings why proceeding you're going to have a whole bunch of flown probably look I
