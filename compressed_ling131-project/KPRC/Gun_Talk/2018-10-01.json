I Would imagine even most skilled march men with two dogs yourself\nA mile wash uncle and my three year old how you would even\nA and it's just something to where you can't think about it if you're going to do it you just have to do it but it didn't work out\nAnd it's this worry of bodies are dogs and people and everything else and the danger of courses that you could try to shoot a dog hit somebody else that's where I was talking about it's got to be a contact shot\nWhether you like screw the Muslim dogs ear and pull the trigger or whatever but understanding that it's still nice report

I'm an Carrick Fox News the United states Mexico Canada agreement us MCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\n[laughter] exactly that's exactly it in a nutshell it's it's really you know really the the origins of that John as it take um you know take every rep and make a diagnostic like we say and and it's\nYou know and it's no it's no more intuitive or ... no more I'm thoughtful or or advanced than a than a basketball you know that your your bring it to your home\nYou get a lot of reps in if you if you missed or not you know but you know on a brick wall you know with a basketball doesn't work you don't get the feedback you know and you know and that is a counter the premise of it and\nNot to mention other attributes just making the training convenient do a lot of things we can't do on a range and then of course I felt federally didn't build that for the masses that build up for myself it just has\nI wasn't gonna mostly how did this come about in the first place\nYou know it it it's a good question I let me think that will take a step back a second I Know for college football and like competitive Venus and such and those are the formative years in life and everything and got misled and was life badly and turn went to law school and the lawyer\nDuring the Clinton years you but you can recover from that right I I'm recovering I Am recovering seven years been retired for yeah [laughter]\nUm you know the ... them in and see what that was about but the moral world or the competitive shooter is love shooting 'em all discipline them one of those weirdos that love bull's eye and I started out they'll love like a feat steel and us PSA\nI'm Still shooting ... didn't have it in our area you know honestly but anyways uh you know and I just looked at it like sports perspective I was never ... always been fascinated with\nYour military and first bond or looking at the career options but never never never done that just just by way of uh you know football in law school that stuff\nSo [noise] but I just love shooting always loved guns very passionate but I get that looked at it from a sport science perspective hey look you know I'm looking at the skill set of running around the seller rating shooting speeding accuracy just\nI look at some guy like Nick liquor during this later age like this is something you know new Gulf or\nYou know racket ball and this is this is this is the real deal you know I just I just couldn't believe I never was exposed to it before and it was I got to make in the short answer long and short for long but you know I just had to build my own tool for high volume filth diagnostic training and ironically nothing on the market and it was an air ... has its place but you know the green got us\nRight now yeah they're so different now and I'm looking here on the website and the next level training dot com you this comes in a glock in in Smith Wesson him and he Clunes if you will\nYou know these these are not you know these are not cheap these are actual school then I Know a number of serious trainers who all have certain pistols and they use them for for training but also ... give us the example of who uses it and I wanted to do with us or pistol\nYeah you bet it ... several different markets segments were split up like that between you know instructor and we see in her instructors but generally open enrollment instructors law enforcement of course I'm you know ... and ... within all the years really is a theory is if you want to just just get get wrapped practical reps in a classroom\nUm where a lot of the manipulation skills as far and just intertwining safety with the proficiency\nI mean yeah we can talk for control and grip grip establishment confide alignment do a lot of drills but when you get the big it in their hands you really see muzzle awareness trigger finger discipline and I've never had a class but incorrect someone on that somewhere along the way you know um but then from there I mean our ideal is really that high volume training like this\nLike I have several search around the house I just pick it up and get rats that on ... so you got the trains side is hard core training and then more of a lifestyle\nOf training where you can't really keep you're like well you can't keep your life are lying around so to speak\nYou know do you like\nBut at the surface of this is always there and like I said at functional features of life are tools and so it's yeah it's it ...\nDo you have ports are are are you know testimonials about how this helps in how you could benefit from a certain postal\nShe were looking at a phone study right now I'm through you and I'll be like on that an actual like like the word you know a control group study I was just down this summer I'm a doctor show in on that on a request of uh of one of the um when do you want to vote on a ... of a an agency\nSo anyways um but I mean the ... yeah I mean does your questions that get yeah we have a litany of anecdote of particularly than officer doesn't pass calls like this are\nThey trained for the weekend they got to have training they gotta have different training grip establishment\nAnd all that right you got to know what you're doing it but then yeah yeah\nYeah exactly it's like Gina basketball you gotta have balance elbow I'd fault you know I mailed out right away\nIn a bad mechanics but um and then they come back and bathroom strongly you know strong you know their their qualifications and and I don't just want to emphasize called ... to me that's like path and freshman English ... I mean that's like that's just a one on one thing right I mean\nI think there's something I Want to call in here Mike and I think it may be the parts that you had mentioned that to me is the most important reason to get a search just all\nYeah that is the safety aspects\nI cannot tell you and you know the stories\nHow many negligent discharges have been made which is so called unloaded guns and people are products and shooting ...
