{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "Um I don't think there's even thought of doing a python\nThey throw away the way the drawings they threw away the ... that threw away the machinery for making the python you know Thirty years ago and every once in a while they'll make noises about maybe we could do that again\nOr if they do it will be the same guy and it'll be something different and look like we're we're python but it will be the same but I don't think so uh so now let me ask you you mentioned I I'm more of a three thirty six thirty six\nYeah I got it might be a trio wait one I'm looking at is the year one at Walmart man\nShot or are you sure it's not cheaper for the thirty thirty\nTo thirty ... you're right after I found that you are totally correct yeah\n'cause I was gonna say if there's that came out in the story of six I missed that one\n[laughter] sorry about that you're totally correct okay All right so what's the question about that\nIs that a good value not just for deer hunting with my boy or a ... a but also to hang on to for critters other you [noise]\nOkay uh this is where it gets a little tricky and we'll give you a quick history okay a Marlins I always made really good guns or they were purchased the company was purchased some decade ago by Remington remove the company and there are a lot of people who say the guns were never as good after that\nUh I don't know if that's true but I have a lot of reports of that\nIf it were me right now I [noise] I like old ... ... I Would be I Would consider looking for an older Marlon as opposed to a new one\nAnd I don't know how you feel about buying a used growing older gun versus brand new but for me I'd be looking for an older one just go I like him so much\nWhat would you do that\n[noise] um well obviously the gun stores around the cell use guns you could poke around you could actually just color during that Dr cholera under areas hey do you have any ah older boiling liberal actually thirty thirties\nNow there's also a couple or three Web sites that are very well known and very well respected are probably the biggest of them is called gun broker gun broker dot com\nAnd you could find guns there and you can buy them and what they do is they ship them to your local gun store and then you do the background check their and usually have like a three day approval period if you don't like it you can return it but you check that out with people there or who you're buying from but you could check gun broker dot com\nOr however if you go in the store you like to look for the new Marlon there's nothing wrong with that just by it and I think it's going to be fine I Love ... I Would offer if you are not aware there's one or the company at least one of the country making really nice lover actually just him repeating arms\nAnd they make very nice lever actually you know a lot of us you might check out him repeating oranges will compare all\nThose and make your calls you're not going to go wrong because ... she's thirty thirty has something to last forever [laughter] so\nI Wish you luck with that you're going to have to face when we come back to talk about a ... gun rights to the United states forces me to use today [noise] [noise]\nAre you looking for places in\nA trip to a celebration turns tragic I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News\nI saw um a lot of people up here at the apple barrel out in the parking lot and then I heard screaming a limo\n[laughter] oh 'cause they want to thank God you know they want more gun control and um to do that you have to sort of push this myth that that that the rights of the the right to bear arms as a collective right you know for people in militias and things like that and not something for the individual to do that you have to [noise] you have to\nBasically revised or throw out the history of the gun in America which was a an individual right from the beginning reason they didn't talk about it all the time was because it was like\nSuch such as a non starter it was like breathing the air or something like you know are going to church you know people on them and had them and no one really question that right on so probably the Nineteen thirties\nAnd it's interesting you put it that way because you're right way back the idea of you have a gun you have a gun for self protection for providing food for protecting your family that was trying to explain that to someone would be like saying well let me explain to you that we need to breathe\nNearby would go ... well yeah why are we even talking about\nI mean we wouldn't even and people on the sort of outskirts of society for instance I mean they wouldn't be able to survive without guns who would have been impossible for them and [noise]\nUm you know I mean I you know the idea that that some government person would calmer the state would come and say you have to ask for permission to defend yourself\nIs the antithesis of what the whole constitution is about in many ways I think how people treat the second amendment tells you a lot about how they think about freedom in general and that's why it's so important and that's why it's the first freedom\nWhat'd you say that I like that where the guy how people treat the second amendment tells you what they think about freedom and I find in the discussions we have a lot of people in America who\nPut in my armchair psychologist role here I think maybe they know that they are not protecting themselves and their family they're not doing everything they should do\nAnd the fact that I Am and others are stands in stark evidence in contrast to what they're doing and if they can make sure that we're not taking care of ourselves than they do have to feel bad about not taking care of themselves and their family is that is that going too far\nI I think that that's that's definitely the case with some people I think that's definitely part of it I think the other part of it is that a lot of those people that you're mentioning\nAnd others um view the government very differently as they view it as a protector all the time and they don't want you to rely on yourself because the more you rely on the state the more important to state is and that's what they want it to be in your life\nIt's already too important in my estimation already too big and too invasive but they wanted to be more of that and I think guns are one of the things that are very tangible thing that it can take away from me or may not allow you to have it's something that it was unsafe\nAnd it can be used by bad people but of course not when it's used by the right people in their laws typically just inhibit good people from having guns not bad people so\nWhen you talk and you've done a lot of research for this book is titled but by the way first freedom a ride to America's during history with the gun from revolution and he's basically the history of the gun and the role it played in America throughout when you talk to people do you find that there are a considerable number of people who really don't\nKnow what's the role firearm was or I think it was much much less than it actually was [noise]\nThat it's much less yeah I mean I'm In Washington DC right now and I would say that most people I mentioned certain stories of the gun ... never knew about how important it was I mean just take some take Sam cold for instance that people understand\nHow an incredible personality was how he changed the world with a interchangeable parts long before Henry Ford that did anything of that nature and they don't understand that he was sort of the first industrial is in that guns are such a big deal and that\nYou know he sold them and and change the way that we sell things to people and he went to England did open a factor all the things I don't take the\nHistorians glorify him in the way they do other inventors for instance because it was a gun and they view guns in a you know in a negative way\nWell you know once you start doing your research you realize that the industrial revolution in America hinged upon firearms you know he was interchangeable parts it was all of these advancements that we take for granted and that as you say people attribute to him before no no no our Sam coke was doing a\nRoommate who was doing it the people making guns were doing it long before\nAnd that was you know good ballet was where the industrial revolution actually took place\nSlowly the first industrial revolution driven by gun manufacturing I mean there are other things involved but a gun manufacturers were on the you know the cutting\nConfusing well and was confusing not any more until you about to price them to car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you'll\nPick connection you'll get the fastest Internet available to download speeds up to nine hundred and forty ... TV phone and a two year price guaranteed all for Seventy nine have\nFor the car you want including the success reason basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because ... shows you what other people are paying\nFor the Ninety nine per month on line with a two year agreement plus get two hundred dollars toward a range of Google and that's smart home devices and a one hundred dollar visa but\nWhen they are ... some things never do and who's diamond mine Tom ... gun done bones\nIs that good six six talking God gets you in here we have some people are on hold but we do have a\nCouple of lines open it's like to join us right now again just call Tom talk and let's see life to deals with the south Richmond, Virginia Jill thanks for your patients I'm Glad you made it on the gun talk\nHer out I think there is more and five hours to get done I\nThink if people are very I think\nI mean [laughter] if I may go even higher rates kind of tough handling it on the highway copyright law firm [laughter]\nFat came out\nYou know I think it's a great point we're teaching kids in fact if your child is attacked in school and fights back defend herself she gets the same punishment is the attacker now that's weird [laughter]\nOut of a storm door I\nMean I don't remember why can't I Can't find it taught me fat and Irish [laughter]\nCan't pay for the\nParents in town the fate of me and I [laughter]\nLet me ask you a question did he ever bother you again\n[laughter]\nNo I wouldn't think so thank you so much for your call ... I think you're right on point there Roberts on four out of all curse California hey Robert watch the view from California\nTo here I'm On the right side of the state anyway\nI Want to congratulate you though on are coming around about the Democrats I remember hearing you and I watched your uh what's your growth and I'd have a sister who's a Democrat and she's pretty radical too\nAnd and I've seen through it for ever it's like the Democrats the Democrat who supports the second amendment I Can't think of them you can you\nKnow the ... you get something to give you a little bit of Joe Manchin is probably as close as we get and you never know there but yeah but you know my whole thing harbor in about ... years there probably are still\nDemocrats that I couldn't agree with on some things Democrats I'm Talking about elected politicians now the problem is though every elected politicians you put in who's a Democrat\nIt reinforces the power of the below sea Feinstein a bar brawl you know the whole ... ball if you will of the ultra left is so that even if you say well this is a good Democrat a vote for that person is actually vote for policy and Feinstein\nAnd they're all from California and they were I don't even know where we're heading towards Venezuela [laughter]\nYeah exactly well I I appreciate the call and yeah I I don't like that this is where we are I Wish we had\nA [noise] a system where you could say let's just choose the right person regardless of party but that's just not the way it is and to do that to vote obviously if you're a person who supports gun rights\nYou can't\nTouch sorry you just can't vote for a Democrat even if that person individually is okay on gun rights that person helps below sea and Feinstein by simply by being there and being a vote to be the person on the Democrats' side and gets them control of Congress and they get to decide\nWho heads up the committee's they get to decide which laws get our bills get brought up for vote and they get to decide who is going to be confirmed for Supreme Court justice as I said every single week leading up to the two thousand sixty election\nThis election was not about Hillary Clinton and it was not about Donald Trump it was about the United States Supreme court\nWe now see that coming to pass imagine if you will\nIf Hillary Clinton was president just just\nProcess that for a second that's the uh Eric's on the line one out of Olympia, Washington Eric Washington state because you're in the middle of it there aren't you\nOh boy yeah no idea yeah it's unbelievable [laughter] so what was your take is you're watching these hearings\nRecoiled in horror\nI really got a glimpse of what these people are capable of their color carry ins at heart [laughter] they'll stop at nothing to gain and keep power and they're the same type of people who destroyed Venezuela\nFor that reason I Will never allow them to take my connects you cannot disarm yourself in the face of people like this\nLet me ask you a question I'm going to put you on the spot okay I guess nobody knows who you are really when you say we will never let them take your guns what does that mean\n[laughter] well [laughter] I mean if it ever comes down to the point where they're collecting guns it's time to use your guts\nI look at you and I think that's what it means for millions of people appreciate the call thank you sir yeah I Love the me and my father said let's see there's three hundred million gun or a hundred million gun owners we have three hundred million guns and we have a trillion rounds of ammunition\nFor the Democratic leadership where whether it's are posing Gorsuch Kavanaugh or supporting Kagan Sotomayor or all the rest of it it's an excellent point Dan appreciate that we do you're right and yeah I Know\nI was slow come into it and I get it [noise] I don't like the way it is but you know what ... something is not the way it is just foolish she's childish you see a mature kid is counterproductive in this case that we have to figure this out and say okay this is real simple [noise] my ideal is no Democrats have\nNever\nSymbols\nDamn three point eight ...\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nShe is a school board terrifying attractions one location designed to get\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you the loan them right for\nCall today and let's get started\n[noise]\nAbout to fall on you and your line on Jim's with us out of Nebraska hey Jim you're on TALK what's up\n[noise] yes [noise] a judge Kavanaugh ah I'm Glad that he was confirmed knew I could not listen to a Mrs Ford\nI just couldn't I couldn't I couldn't listen to her couldn't stand her voice I knew she was a liar but Mr\nI have reservations on him or he is a Bush person he's from the swat spent his whole life in Washington DC I'm afraid he's going to be more of the Justice Roberts and a a one of the\nConservative the more Roberts than Scalia\nOh yes by far by far and and that's that's my fear ...\nI understand given the background let me throw the stature though I'm looking at what a\nJudge Kavanaugh wrote two thousand eleven\nAnd a case where he actually descended on with the district court a D.C court he said that quoted would strain logic in common sense\nThat the second amendment would allow semi automatic hand guns but not semi automatic rifles which have not traditionally been banned in common used today\nAnd those are protected under Heller\nHis point was there these assault weapons so called assault weapons ban they don't ban semi automatic here in guns he says I'm Sorry that does not stand that doesn't make any sense at all and Heller says anything in common you cannot be banned and so they actually talked about that during the hearings as well\nThat speaks pretty well for him from where I didn't\nI I just I just don't like it association with Bush is it's\nA I I don't disagree with you there because ...\nI voted for both of them and I voted against the Democrat what I Would not have voted for either one of them had there been some conservative choice\nI I I agree I mean look here's Ronald Reagan was not a friend of gun owners\nI Would go way back there people are already you know he did not do us any favors and better than he just happened to be better than the alternative Bush yes we're not friends to gun owners they were just better than the alternative in this case yeah he served under Bush you to work there\nI I Am more enthusiastic perhaps and maybe a little bit less cautious than you are in this one I now understand I I don't think you get an absolute rabid you know the second amendment person\nIn any of these folks but having said that his history of decisions is really good really strong second remembered I I think we're going to be OK\nJustice Thomas [noise] it's\nProbably in my opinion the most gun friendly other just what do you think\nI agree completely I think you're on the money he has several times invited\nA cases to come we wish we could get some of these and then when they were turning them down he would write you know it looks like we're we're turning the second amendment into a second class a law or our ... our rights and also saying that you know we're basically turned our backs on held her so Thomas has been strong\nI think you're going to find that uh the Kevin Thomas connections going to be strong as well\n\nSo we will find out I guess I mean that's that's where we are again thanks for your call and I'm I'm not saying you're wrong and I think it's good to be cautious but hey you know what we have him and ultimately as I say this is what the election was about was bronco Obama said elections\nHave consequences you will you try to stuff in our face when he said that we're works back the way we the people spoke we elected Donald Trump because because we weren't the Supreme Court and that's\nMuch finer reasons for a lot\nOf liberal was that\nThere's a new company actually an old companies getting under gun off richer and want to hear but goes already like this guy [noise]\nAre you looking for places she\nA tragic ride to a celebration I'm Steve Rapaport Fox News twenty people killed yesterday in a crash involving a limo in upstate New York authorities saying the limo blew past a stop sign\nUm it is not a new invention from us I'm like a laser sites you know having over time but\nWhat what we're good at is making things at work or make things that have been thought through from an engineering standpoint\nUm and also from a quality standpoint um if you're putting that on your firearm dislike are laser lights for personal defense you're really needs to work when you want it to so we took that same approach to the engineering and the acquisition of these products as well so they\nThey're not they're not anything different in terms of quality that you would expect from ...\nWell that's interesting that's kind of burying the lead as we say because to say well you know they're not different from what you expect from us except that what you expect from criminal trace is the very best you guys have always been I mean you're so top of mind when somebody thinks lasers site a weapon amount of laser\nThey say ... price because\nYou're it's been your category\nSo you're\nThere's a real responsibility I mean you're the guy at the top and you've got to be looked at this and thinking you know one we are now asking the firearms market to trust us in a new area because you have an enormous bank of trust there\nAnd that's kind of be a daunting when you're thinking about bringing out new products\nYeah it's a big responsibility and one that we take seriously and as you say as the market leader and really the innovator in laser sites um we went out it took our time a way that it with the\nThe idea that our customers who trust us for what they know us for today is going to trust you know we hope is going to trust us for something that they don't know as for today but that that goodwill that we've built up over all these years and the expectation of quality of customer service you know I think our customer services as good\nAs any ones in the industry um if anyone ever has a problem with our products\nOr thinks they have a you know any issue with their products we're here to stand behind it all of those things\nAre being brought to bear on the on the opportunity for the new products for example a rifle scopes a lifetime warranty\nOn those are our electronic sites the same warranty as our laser sites you know three years but really if you have an issue with it and and you know it's a product problem just like we do all the way through will will find a way to take care of your show\nIt was a big responsibility for us but you know is what we do every day so um we didn't really need to change our our philosophy we just need to focus it on a new set of products\nYou were able to tap in because I mean I've been to your place there and you've got some really really smart folks there were you able to tap into that bring trust on on what to include and what to do with these robots\nYeah you know we were fortunate in like a lot of companies in the industry where some of our engineer's a most of them and a lot of other products\nIn particular in customer ... support people their users their power users of our products um you know Gary killings worth and different people who have been on the show from time to time um he's actually a gun site right now are putting the products through the paces so\nWe have that that brain trust of engineers and product people in customer service people who also listen to the customer uh we we you know it isn't it isn't always what we think very much for the customer wants\nAnd over the years we've heard when we've asked you know what what else might you consider from crimson trace and products that were coming out with work we're always on the top of the list and um you know now is the right time with\nA new ownership and and really just a a kind of a new chapter for the business to go after those markets\nWhere it's interesting it also comes an interesting time of course you've got products here for three gun which is usually popular uh obviously for rifles but I Am seeing real increase a serious increase in people\nWho are willing to put a red Dr site on their self defense carry pistol are you seeing that are you hearing that\nYou know we see more and more of that um it's it's interesting to see different manufacturers glock and others who are is our parent company of the pie from Smith in Washington and come comes out\nWith a slide that's already a cut for these kinds of optics so\nYou know it's something that they are the consumers asking for it used to be a custom is Asian and sometimes not a very simple\nCustomers Asian now as you say more and more people walk that I'm not just for the three ... and the other guys who are helping using these for years but for concealed carry product um laser sites are great not everybody may want to lose your site and so these are as a ... or cited in low light but they're they're frankly a little better during daylight\nYeah exactly so All right so ah are you calling this anything special a different name or they just call crimson trace read outside\nYou know so they're they're branded crimson trace a wave after almost twenty five years of using the same brand in the same logo on it made sense to upgrade an update our logo so you'll see a slightly it's the same name you know the tea\nOr his are kind of marker brand bark but we've we've changed a little bit updated it\nAnd then also added three ... three focus categories kind of sub categories protection tactical an sport\nUm that that moves us and expand us into those other markets so\nA today at least all the products are ... are coming out in the crimson trace brand um we we felt like you know the boundaries of the brand can extend to at least these products categories who knows in the future you know what that may look like 'em but these are very much you know criminal trace products with again everything that a customer would expect from clubs and try\nAnd whip it completely unsaid but more to come I Would say that's right that's right [laughter]\nWell and congratulations it is and it's a really cool product lodge a whole line of products from groups and tribes and obviously a zillions of people have your products on their guns already so they're gonna want to take a look at best it may be corporate bison to their their packages\n[noise] well we certainly hope so uh the products will be starting to flow in the market come November and into December so you know we're talking about um first in this case and then start delivering them in a in a month or so\nBut yeah I'd I Would invite the customers you know and even those who who may not to take a look I think there'll be pleased with what they see and I think you again for a let me have a chance to talk about him\nYou bet and all the information is right there on the website criminal trace dot com link Tobias right cause so much thank you Tom take her\nAnd I think you know I ...

us you've got a special October fest beer a Mars and tell us about\nA lot of a breeze don't make loggers and we don't make a ton of logger but\nIncreasingly we're making more and more locker is a bigger craft brewery we've got the the tank the laboratory a tank space laboratory expertise\nAnd we love October fest season we love making this nice multi marching style beer it's designed to be drunk in quantity because that's what we do when we go to October fest we don't skimp on the mugs size and fill it up\nAnd or something that you can drink three for ... if if that's what you want to do\nI so that's limited availability and then next we've got these special double cream out then I'm looking at this thing Larry and uh I mean it looks like a chocolate bar ready to be a consumer

in a ... bottles little hundred eighty seven middle middle liter bottles are designed as a sweet stout as a group a dessert beer a ended the night a sort of thing and um\nYou know just to a creamy rich sweep style\nWell we're going to follow up with a stout that I have purchased\nIt's called the ... brewery Kalamazoo stopped but I'm going to kind of put a little slant on it the famous song called the I've got a gallon Kalamazoo stop this is an American stout I've just poured it looks like I poured a glass of his press oh it is I mean like a but they're all looking cigar\n[noise] you know I I guess that would probably call this a medium stout um you know it's it's certainly fuller than than getting a sin and more alcohol\nAnd don't you know going back to ... literary stuff that we're talking about there's an old Kurt Vonnegut book and I can't remember which one it is where he talks about his grandfather being a brew master and how all brew masters have a secret ingredient\nAnd so back in the day we always used this Italian brewers licorice and making Kalamazoo stout\nAnd when you know if you don't know that it's there you probably wouldn't pick it out several years ago the government decided that we had to start putting that on the label so we do use a little bit of this growers licorice not really for flavor but more for ... feel their\nUm so this is our our ... year round stout our everyday uh drinking stout uh from but uh\nYou know learned is fabulous as we wrap it up it is a lot of flavor but I mean loads of dark chocolate\nSome nice coffee

we really are set up fascinating fantastic so what is going to mean for gun rights while we talk about that in a ... a there are a number of cases headed to the Supreme Court there are some that they've turned down because they basically been turning down cases gun cases it takes four votes\nTo accept their case but the thinking is we don't know for sure what happens inside the Supreme Court thinking is they've turned down some of these gun cases even though they probably had the four votes to accept it because they knew they didn't have the five votes that would take\nTo win and rather than say well that's reinforced a Supreme Court precedent\nThat your gun rights should be diminished where does not going to take those cases until we know we can decide correctly and so the Heller

important they are and to help us get a grasp on that and actually gives you some tools that you can use because sometimes you think you know I'm not really up on all of that joining us right now is mark Olivier from the national Shooting Sports foundation hey mark welcome\nTom thanks for having me appreciate you get into some time to talk about how these lectures are to gun owners\nAbsolutely because you know and I talked to people I said yeah you know I'm going to need to do that but I'm not sure where to vote or I'm not sure where my candidate is on this prime not sure well that's kind of what the whole gun vote things about isn't it [noise]\nIt is so and that's Assaf or several years ago wash dark gun vote a program so they go to ... or it will take you to a Web page where you can type in you know where you live and it will tell you your candidates are and where they stand on gun issues and and just like it was a two years ago in the presidential election\nThis mid term elections going to be crucial as to as to what stands for rice you know who's going to be protecting our rights\nAnd what we can expect out of the next couple of years so when it comes to the fires policy in America\nIt's interesting you say because it's the fires policy I'm not sure people say well you I Know yeah we want to win\nAnd I want to stop and say well let me explain to you what this means because right now the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the White House\nWhen the Democrats get control of the house for instance they can control what bills are introduced that can control what bills are voted on if the Democrats control the Senate of course they get control of the confirmation process on Supreme Court justice as we've just seen that battle there\nAnd of course the Democrats also announced that if you control the house they're going to try to impeach a President Trump and also they're going to try to impeach our Brett Kavanaugh chief justice now will scream court\nThey can only do those things if they are in the majority of each else am I right\nAbsolutely right and that's how I Am so what we have control of both the house and Senate\nFor ... for most politicians from our elected leaders who are listening to their gun owners are voting for them then they're going to make sure that these fish pointless investigations these pointless hearings\nOn our body down to Congress in getting important are all issues pushed forward in pushing back the ones that are truly got to be detrimental to us on our ability to exercise our Second Amendment rights\nYou know and are just so people understand what we're talking about we're talking about the everybody says well we need a national reciprocity you're not going to get that with Democrats in control of the house on the Senate you know we want a the hearing Protection Act you're not going to get that\nWith the Democrat Party in charge of the house and Senate it's not going to happen to physically a logically impossible to get those but what you are going to get a lot of efforts at more restrictive gun control laws which means stripping away or infringing on your rights\nYou're you're absolutely right of the time so I looked at the national character of us ... been introduced in the last Congress\nBut still pending out there the hearing Protection Act as as a builder still pending out there uh and and the joy so overwhelming support but because of the difficult in the math and the Senate because it only takes one senator filibuster hold those bills up\nWe haven't been able to those two issues for which we know are crucial issues too far in America today they want to see these things pass they want to see them for to be able to exercise their rights without any kind of impediment so\nEven when we're talking about having control these houses are still poor that we have a majority to be able to do this we need sixty senators to filibuster cruise able to move says is true in right now we have a razor thin margin in the Senate so we really need to make sure that\nThey are voters out there are educated as to where they're kind of stand they know where the issues are and they can go find that at a at gun folk out of work\nYou know market occurs to me also one of the things or incest F works on\nA lot of things that people don't know about their important but they're kind of\nHit not secret exactly but they're just not on the radar things like this would be important or in the upcoming election things like the effort to use the EPA to try to ban entire classifications of ammunition because they contain let\nShore yeah it it's not just that the federal level wishing that the state level as well so\nOur folks that are working wash it share meeting with their legislators everyday that meeting with both the house in the Senate they're\nBoth in it was a Republican or Democrat and they're they're trying to make sure they understand what the what the unintended consequences of these bills could be so they start to ban led ammunition traditionally mission and they say you can't use that for hunting it\nReally isn't a move to try and clean up their arm because it hasn't been proven that this lead exposure to to the environment has been any impact but if they tried to ban that really what it is back way of ... people from exercising their rights we all know that nontraditional and ... it was shot ... non toxic shot is\nLike\nAnd they're going to be even better I'm I'm trying to be careful here because we don't we're spill the beans we we get a chance to play with a lot of these these guns at the time I'm One of them I really got huge\nWe had a ball with a contract some video I think you're just going to enjoy the heck out of the question is Hi this is kind of a question\nDo you need a new gun do any of us do any of us really need a new gun thank goodness need is really not a factor for us um yeah I've got nine to not have forty five ...\nCan be said what are you what do you need another sent me out of all I'll fortunately I don't think I absolutely need\nOne but if you're really into it it's not difficult at all to find a gap an opening however\nInfant testimony ... small it might be oh well that would fit right between this and that and I don't have anything that fits this gap that I have just cruise [laughter] yeah I Know and look we we have to self enable\nWhenever we can't find a buddy a friend who will help us in April All right so that's\nSomething we after ... hey I'm looking at a some news

[noise] and I like old guns okay I Would be I Would consider looking for an older Marlon\nAs opposed to a new one\nAnd I don't know how you feel about buying a used gun older gun versus a brand new but if it were me I'd be looking for an older one just 'cause I like him so much\nWhat would you do that\n[noise] um well obviously in the gun stores around the cell use guns you could poke around you could actually just color and you have to drive Carender areas hey do you have any ah older Marlon lover actually thirty thirties\nNow there's also a couple or three Web sites that are very well known and very well respected are probably the biggest of them is called gun broker gun broker dot com\nAnd you can find guns there and you can buy them and what they do is they ship them to your local gun store and then you do the background check their and usually have like a three day approval period if you don't like it you can return it but you check that out with people there who you're buying from but you could check gun broker dot com\nOr however if you go in the store you like to look to the new Marlon\nThere's nothing wrong with that just by it and you know I think it's going to be fine I Love ... I Would offer if you are not aware\nThere's one or the company at least one of the country making really nice lover actually just him re repeating arms\nAnd they make very nice liver actually he's now a major us you might check out him repeating orange is well compare all\nThose and make your calls you're not going to go wrong because I never actually thirty thirty has something to last forever [laughter] so\nI Wish you luck with that you're going to have to pay when we come back and talk about a ... gun rights to the United states forces me to use today [noise] [noise]\nAre you looking for places she\nNational Shooting Sports betting\nFor my mom my wife and my sister even some of the guys in my family I'm always able to find incredible gifts for them at a price I can afford and I don't have to drive that far to\nThe panhandle preparing for a possible hurricane this week I'm an ... Fox News tropical storm Michael headed into the Gulf of Mexico is strengthening and expected to be a hurricane by tonight or Tuesday Fox meteorologist Adam clot\nNow why would they do that\nBecause they want they want more gun control and to do that you have to sort of push this method that the rights of the right to bear arms as a collective right you know for people in militias and things like that and not something for the individual such do that you have to [noise]\nYou have to basically revised or throughout the history of the gun in America which was an individual right from the beginning reason they didn't talk about it all the time was because it was like such a nonstarter it was like breathing the air or something like you know we're going to church you know\nOh on them and had them and no one really question that right until probably the Nineteen thirties\nAnd it's interesting you put it that way because you're right way back the idea of\nYou have a gun you have a gun for self protection for providing food for protecting your family that was trying to explain that to someone would be like saying we're here let me explain to you that we need to breathe everybody would go ... or yeah why are we even talking about\nI mean we wouldn't even people on the sort of outskirts of society for instance I mean they wouldn't be able to survive without guns would have been impossible for them and [noise]\nUm you know I mean I you know the idea that some government person would calmer the state would come and say you have to ask for permission to defend yourself\nIs the antithesis of what the whole constitution is about in many ways I think how people treat the second amendment tells you a lot about how they think about freedom in general and uh that's why it's so important and that's why it's the first freedom\nBut it's interesting you say that I like that where the guy how people treat the second amendment tells you what they think about freedom and I find in the discussions we have a lot of people in America who\nPut it in my armchair psychologist role here\nI think maybe they know that they are not protecting themselves in their family they're not doing everything they should do\nAnd the fact that I Am and others are stands in stark evidence in contrast to what they're doing and if they can make sure that we're not taking care of ourselves than they do have to feel bad about not taking care of themselves and their family is that is that going too far\nI think that that's that's definitely the case with some people I think that's definitely part of it I think the other part of it is that a lot of those people that you're mentioning\nAnd others um view of the government very differently is they view it as a protector all the time and they don't want you to rely on yourself because the more you rely on the state the more important the state is and that's what they want it to be in your life\nIt's already too important in my estimation already too big and too invasive but they wanted to be more of that and I think guns are one of the things that are very tangible thing that it can take away from me or it may not allow you to have it something that if he was unsafe\nUm and it can be used by bad people but of course not when it's used by the right people in their laws typically just in hip it good people from having guns not bad people so\nWhen you talk and you've done a lot of research in this book titled the book by the way it's first freedom a ride to Americans enduring history with the gun from revolution and it's basically the history of the gun and roller blade in America throughout when you talk to people do you find that there are a considerable number of people who really don't\nKnow what the role of firearm was or I think it was much much less than it actually was [noise]\nThat it's much ... yeah I mean I'm In Washington DC right now and I would say that most people I mentioned the sort of stories of the gun ... never knew about how important it was I mean just take some takes him coal for instance that people understand\nHow an incredible personality what's how he changed the world with a interchangeable parts long before Henry Ford that did anything of that nature and they don't understand that he was sort of the first industrial is that guns are such a big deal and that\nYou know he sold them and and change the way that we sell things to people and he went to England in open affect her all the things I I don't take that historians\nGlorify him in the way they do other inventors for instance because it was a gun and they view guns in a you know in a negative way\nMore than once you started your research you realize that the industrial revolution in America hinged on firearms you know was interchangeable parts it was all of these advancements that we take for granted and that as you say people attribute to Henry Ford\nNo no no our Sam Cooke was doing it a room and Jim was doing it people making guns were doing it long before\nAnd that was you know gun valley was were the industrial revolution actually took place\n... the the first industrial revolution driven by gun manufacturing I mean there are other things involved but\nA gun manufacturers were on the you know the cutting edge of the of the technology of the day you know Sam Cole had his factory in Hartford and it was almost it reminds me when I read about it reminds me a little bit like Google or something today where people lived on campus and they were very immersed in like the business aspect of it but [noise]\nUm he was an amazing man and it wasn't just him there were many engineers out there doing incredible things and a gun definitely were big driving part of that commerce in America\nYou know and I'm looking at some of the chapters you have your the peace dividend you're talking about you know a modern rifles or the fault in the fall and rise of sharp shooters I'm calling from Chris Kyle\nYou got you know you really are tracking the kind of the role of firearms what's the goal why did you do this book in the first place\n[noise] well I I've been you know most I write about politics and I've been very involved in the debates or a Second Amendment for you know Fifteen Years and um it's very important to me even though I live in places where it's hard to get guns or maybe because I live in those places but\nThe reason was I think that we're always arguing about the ideology and the politics guns into safety and the mass shootings and kind of those things and they're important to talk about [noise]\nBut we've never talked about is why guns are certain bed it in the DNA of this country and why people [noise]\nUh you know if people always ask me you know why is America so different what's with the gun culture you know wherever I go there always sort of smearing it the gun culture well\nIt didn't just pop up and you know Nineteen Seventy seven it's been around from the beginning and I wanted people to know what that story was and why the guy who's buying a gun today shock and after the whatever why he is has that guy and why he cares about that gun and why he is\nA responsible with that guy and he understands maybe the history even if he doesn't know every part of it he under its he's part of a sort of cultural continue on you know\nAnd and he

so it after the minute that we're fighting the British no one asked them to have their weapons back after you know and the men I stood at Lexington and Concord\nThey were protecting a cache of weapons and powder they weren't fighting for you know income inequality or whatever I don't want to diminish other issues but they were fighting because someone was coming to take their means of defending themselves and survival away and ... you know historians sort of diminish that fact all the time and that was one of the reasons I wanted to write a book about it\nWell I Would recommend the book because I think when people get this when they read it they will then be able this value in it certainly getting the information is won by\nBut I'm more material maybe more practical value is once
