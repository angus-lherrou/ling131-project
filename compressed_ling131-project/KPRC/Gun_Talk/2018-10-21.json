{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KPRC", "content": "[noise] or just is Christian Ari the editor of rebound dot com great\n... really authority when you're looking for information about craft beer even jobs are on there so you want to be a ... see they've got a a regional brewery representative available for war pigs USA or if you want to be the head ... a traditional Brewing Company you guys pretty much have it all there Chris\nUm but when we look at today when you see beers that are being introduced\nWhat is required in your estimation in order to be successful in order to be able to be viable product a viable brewery what are the essential first I Would say capitals got to be one of them\nBecause we don't have the capital to compete today I think you're going to be out of luck the old days where you could just make a great beer and people will find that the rover but what what are the are in your estimation what are the key ingredients for a new craft beer entrant to succeed\nYeah I mean I think a an incredible brand first and foremost um is is something that is becoming increasingly important I'm certainly you know making a really high quality\nUniquely well differentiated product is a is important as well but at at this point I think that's sort of table stakes\nYou know the the fact that you make a really high quality beer isn't going to that you apart any longer so then you start figuring out well what does um and I think ultimately it's going to come back to brands and a\nBrand that consumers identify with so you know are you a brewery that has you know an older looking label that you might have picked up in the nineties or\nAre you ah you know are are you paying attention to 'em some of the design elements that\nAre other companies be it in the tech industry or the wind industry or the auto industry whatever it is um are you paying attention to those visual cues that consumers are gravitating towards and incorporating them into the look and feel of your brand\nUm I think that's one thing that that is critically important now I'm obviously capital or if you're going to go big um and you're going to try to scale quickly or try to sell your beer and multiple markets it's really really costly you have to put feet on the street you have to\nUm you know you you have to support the brand with marketing and digital ads and um you know I think just the the amount of money that you're going to need to spend to sell your beer has increased um so if if you plan on taking that approach um you better be well capitalized\nUm you know I think a third leave you should have a really strong tap room and you should be um you know in an area where there is some foot traffic or at least\nBeing an area where people can easily access you um I think that because there are so many breweries out there now and because so many more breweries have opened up\nEither satellite tap rooms or places to experience the brand in you know within a city\n[noise] um the days of sort of being in an industrial park you know thirty miles outside of a\nA major hub and you know expecting that people will travel there every single day or every single weekend um I think that you know those days are sort of fleeting as well unless you have something really really special you know that they can't get anywhere else um so I think those would be the things that I Would look at\nAll right we will look wrap it up or find the concluding segment with Christopher in our area brew bound dot com and we get back we'll give some are Christians

bloggers and and I see a so both ends of the spectrum or one of my favorite beers here in the New England area is the von Trapp pills neurotic Vermont I'm so for any listeners in in the New England area I definitely think that one out\nUh I got to give a shout out\nYeah yeah for sure whether it be was the first job\nWas it really is about yet but not many people were buying this was in the early nineties ... it was only for whether federal is the first major coffee [noise] [noise] oh yeah yeah\nIt otherwise you had hallowed him and this was you know this was even when I think even one Bob ... wrote this book and Seventy Seventy mostly had\nSure either here's a question for you or I mean the big book of going back to it says more stuff about hand loading in hunting rifles and this is not like ... competition rifles this is a hunting rifle but the two is kind of\nMerged hunting rifles are really incorporating a lot of the stuff that we have learned and advancement we've picked up from the long range shooting a competition world\nExactly ... and ... and he said for even getting a bullets that are both have the incredibly high ballistic called Fisher um target bullet controlled expansion so we're getting in some ways the best of both worlds especially for people to hunt more and open country\nSo the question now is and this is the million dollar question is there a reason to handle it anymore\n[noise] in many ways not especially if it's one of the reasons the six point five ... ...\n... you can buy really pop really accurate factory ammunition both for match I mean it doesn't cost cost much\nAnd I hope you know who are at low down even longtime ally voters\nYes ... exactly I mean basically I have not pool to the handle on a ...\nFor a number of years now because I just look at and go man the factory animal is so good you know yes the bones are better\nBut the other thing is six Thirty years ago did you want to do something it was going to shoot a half inch you had him now there are probably a half a dozen or does it manufactures animal makers who will sell you boxes of animal that is you have in ...\nOh yeah and often factory rifles really inexpensive factory\nRight mhm it's it's kind of queasy nominal yeah yeah it's very different the world that we grew up in about ...\n... All right so as we look at the world now that we're in one of the big changes and I was going to get you talking about this max some years ago if you weren't a flat shooting rifle you just went with more and more velocity 'cause that was in some ... we were we were all about building magnet rooms and big you know allowed and ... and all of that\nAre not necessary anymore is it\nNo no it's not necessary anymore I Do a lot of a lot hotter still believe that she was a kid they here long range they think of high velocity when the high BC bullets\nUh you don't need it does it eat you may not even flat ... new cartridges may not quite as far as the old the hive last archery but because we had range finders we can compensate for the range sites\nAnd I will yes\nWell actually the truth there is no the reason we wanted flat shooting carts do some ... because we were guessing at the range\nIn fact we didn't know what the range was we were using all sorts of things like estimating football fields here to the nearest problem or an adult\nAnd write or two lines and the scope and you were supposed to put it on the back in the belly of a critter and hope that the standard size critter\nIn your ... good luck with that that's kind of like one hundred years from now to\nShed that people that got a football field that is it still wasn't as precise as a laser\n... exactly so now you've got a six point five ... enough hits hard enough and the real key is can you put it on targets what's happened to help us put bullets on target\nWell one of the biggest advantage of high ballistic coal fishing boss is not so much they shoot flatter but they retain more energy which helps a little bit but to take trips less than ...\n... and so you get that saying we still have to guess make to a certain extent and you can rise of electronic uh ... your pocket [laughter] but\nAh he ... he can't get a precise idea of land like you can range\nIn his mind well yeah you know we knew that\nUntil we can get our when doping drone that we've seen downrange\n[laughter] ...\nOh my gosh you got to know somebody is doing that right now right\nWhere most of these relive that take place [laughter] but yeah but anything that\nYou had a big advantage of even these moderate philosophy a Partridge just like the six five people if they dress lesson to win so if you make a little error they in the end estimation they kind of make they prevent you from screwing up too much\n[noise] All right let's just a practical uh\nExample if you had a condition where a boy from Thirty years ago would drift\nTen inches to this one side the guy who's going to drift in it just and you use a high BC bold enough today and it's going to drift five inches a basically one can miss or wounded critter and the other one get you the hit that you know now you're just sharpening knife\nYet you're landing the bullet vital is even even like a small error prone am Lopez by Larry\nSide of a falling out eating exactly that\nBullet in that age ... much easier with the high peace you know\nOkay we've kind of talked around this thing was the yeah maybe you know a lot of people don't need to him load but why would you handle wide well more specifically why do you handle it and what do you do with your stuff when your hand learning\n[noise] [noise] well handled part of the ... job but I also still really enjoy it a fan of stumped still it's the only way to use some of the new bullets or because they don't come in a factory\nRight ah like\nFor instance right now I'm working with well actually it's a factory I've been working recently with six point five PR seat which is a slightly bigger\nRight but it's a brand new and it's there's not that many loads available is you know you get Horner the of course\nYeah yeah and it will become more popular I'm sure that\nI had to do I had to do a hand loading article on it and I had a gun I had a gun repair old at it and I want it to use various so that was one recent I hand load and I also found some really accurate often agents that I wasn't I get there the hearty ammo it's fantastic yeah\nBut I beat it a little by little bit my handle is whether this makes any difference when you shoot some size football I don't know uh it\nIt can give you bragging rights when you're shooting with your buddy I guess that would be the other thing handler can still allows you to\nVisit train tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nI Can't say enough good things about Cory diamonds and design whenever I'm shopping for my mom my wife and my sister even some of the guys in my family I'm always able to find incredible gifts for them at a price I can afford and I don't have to drive that far to get there according diamonds and design is located just outside of Houston over in the friends would area\nSo you could park and you won't have to worry about getting mugged in the parking lot kidding but seriously\n...

[noise] now did you have it be altered you buy a dollar to complete the [noise]\nI bought it a shot out rebuild it from there\nBecause a lot of people don't know the ... norm a basically a um a three

an idea what the critters have you taken I take a bet your hunting ... what have you taken with your freely norm American\nI built it so I could go hunting all can\nFor the the the the proper font because you know I hate to say there are some people that that take those kind of things\nThat are just going to ask you what is it that you're actually trying to be careful about when you're doing all this research\nWell there's a difference between a shooter and a a shall we say true collectors peace now now given the price of machine guns these days all of them are are collector's items but\nThere are some of them that are a really more shooters okay and for instance I have I have an MP forty that is a ... to gun which is a a U.S produced receiver that\nHas a German uh parts kept on it that was produced some time between Nineteen sixty eight and a Nineteen eighty six now that gun to me is just the shooter\nThat one is that the one that I shot\nThat is the one that she was shot that as long as the younger one of the\nMost delightful guns on any type I have ever shot\n[noise] now the comparison okay 'cause I'm more than one MP forty I have one that came out of the Winchester museum when Winchester went bankrupt this guy is a late Nineteen forty three gun that is absolutely all original\nIt as a cause the Germans like their their numbers and they put the last two ... didn't last two digits of their serial number on virtually all the parks and every part on that gun is number two the receive\nMight give me an idea of the price difference between those two\nAre the two guns have been running in the fourteen thousand range [laughter] okay um [noise] I\nJust stopped my insurance on the uh on the shall we say collector the sea and Oregon the curia when relic on because the last uh Rock Island or a Rock Island auction\nA collector and the forties went for some really outstanding prices [laughter] I kind of figure something in the um\nTwenty twenty five thousand range\nOkay so knowing what you're getting could be the ... six thousand dollar difference or in some of these guns that could be a twenty or thirty thousand dollar difference yes\nGalleries or go with me 'cause people are gaining okay great but\nYou know I Know a guy who's got a gun kind of a deal I mean and you get these calls 'cause you're known as the machine gun guy and you get these calls and you described to me kind of the three gun example of three different types of guns ... machine guns ... is is as far as what you can buy or maybe can't\n[noise] well I was recently talking to a police department and this is our explained what they had no okay [noise] um [noise] machine guns generally fallen registered machine guns generally fall into three categories\nAnd if you imagined a Thompson sub machine gun that was built in Nineteen forty three and there were three identical Thompson says serial number you know a hundred thousand one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand three okay so so they in essence are identical ...\nOne of them was registered before November thirtieth of Nineteen sixty eight\nOkay one of them was free imported into the country between Nineteen sixty eight in Nineteen eighty six and the last one was re imported into the country after Nineteen eighty six okay okay [noise]\nThe first one is what we would refer to as a transferable machine gun it can be transferred to any body who ... who could legally buy a pistol [laughter]\nOkay you have to be Twenty one you have to not be a convicted felon you do have to live in a state that allows you to own a machine gun in there are a number of states you probably could guess them that don't allow you don't own a machine gun more gently Louisiana swamp it does [noise]\nUm [noise] anyway the transferable guns\nAre are freely transferable that rare but freely transferable they're also there for the most expensive [laughter] a gun that has been brought in after Nineteen sixty eight but\nBefore Nineteen eighty six [noise] is typically either owned by dealer as a dealer sample\nOr by police department now the dealer samples during that time can be freely transferred between dealers okay they can't be transferred to an art ordinary a consumer but they can be transferred between dealers the final type of gun\nIs one that was a\nBrought into the country and registered after Nineteen eighty six after him May of Nineteen eighty six and those are restricted guns and they are restricted\nOnly to the military police and ate dealer who can get a letter from a law enforcement agency requesting a demonstration of that got so\nIn a run through the what would be roughly the prices of these three guns in the market because if you if more people can own it then it becomes more valuable that would be the pre sixty eight right\nSixty eight guns you're probably depending on the model in the condition probably looking at twenty thousand dollars or maybe it maybe more depending on what it is I mean if it's a cult Thompson it may be twice that [noise]\nThe uh what we refer to as the pre sample guns the guns that were\nAre imported and register between sixty eight in eighty six those run about half of what a transfer of ... ... so called at ten maybe twelve thousand dollars\nThe final category are typically only work the some of their parks a thousand bucks because Thompson parks have have value to them but not really any kind of big money\nIs no way you talk about three on three consecutive Sarah numbers could be worth twenty thousand could be worth ten thousand could be the worst one thousand\n[noise] it depends on the paperwork and if if you are possessing the gun with their own type of paperwork it could be worth like ten years I'm sure\nIt that way 'cause it would be contraband for a person to possess a to just not either\nA habit transferred to them on the proper form okay in the in the case for transferable\nOr for a non dealer to possess either of the dealer sample guts now I Need to throw a caviar doubt they're kind of person who is a dealer who owns dealer samples that are pre Nineteen eighty six\nIf he gives up his license can keep those dealer sample that's another reason why they're they have good values\nThey hold on a second I got to take a quick work you're going to come back I Want to continue the conversation talking for a lot of what would be in this the question what would be a good way to get in to\nSet full auto rural voters who may see different guns to guess what would be good level and you want to call the other question is harmless she has a ... cells will tell you why they may be our number is the song God you're a machine gun\nPerson guy or gal give us a hollow maybe you should ask some of the

little bit more power the only question is going to be will be\nLess powerful load have enough energy to work the action act yeah if it if it does then it's fine and use and that could be a course one

somebody said well maybe it is maybe that is possible the truth of it is firearms have pretty much always come from ...\nOriginally it was locked makers are like clocks miss because they were the only ones who could make the it's a good works that required for firearm action and so we called the action part walk\nAnd from that we get the in the English idiom the phrase to lock stock and barrel

around the have guns in um [noise]\nAre you a firearms museum boss when you travel do you try to find cool museums that have stuffed with guns or do you just kind of happened upon them and if you have

I'd love to get your first hand reports on museums you've been to that you thought were cool now one to ... just down the street but very local to us here in New Orleans area as World War two museums started or as the de de museum\nThat increased the Pacific and everything else it's now the world war two museum and it's world class definitely worth going to the\nMuseums you have been to where you found that they had an interesting collection of God's wouldn't necessarily have to be a fire on his museum a gun museum a place where you went you went to that that's a cool display\nUm you know there are a number of them around the country so we'd love to get your reports on that [noise] okay let me find the story because this one was interesting to to to do this was when I make sure I started to beginning\n[noise] what's new is old again we're told his new again the gun ban industry has I Would say\nRediscovered but all they they just bring back the stuff they never give up when you think oh yeah okay they're off that they're never off of\nBanning anything they just switched to the thing is they think they can get at the moment well it turns out for whatever reason and trust me on this they coordinate their back to ammunition\nWhy would they do that ... well you know we may not be able to ban guns but without ammunition to guns won't be any good they won't be able to do anything okay\nAnd then they start it's it's interesting how they'll start with the premise like that well if we could just regulate the ammunition and of course they've done a lot of states where you have to have a license to ... to buy ammunition which is nuts [noise]\nThe ... first quarter businesses it must be most fire it must be that most fire\nIf it doesn't do that and ignored discarded taken off the list give them away to somebody you really don't like or whatever but it's got to work you know and I don't care how much you say well this is cool and look looks great distance hype this is I've seen the videos it doesn't feeding your gun\nYour guns telling you don't use this animal it's real simple deal\nThat's when you switch and that's why I always say look you need to shoot your gun yourself since gun two to five hundred times before you trust your life on it and I want to put about at least fifty rounds through it with my Kerry I'm All right\nSo yeah by the way that a

you're going to need at least that and got us talking about this ... ... fires museum is only one fifth of the whole thing there but it's amazing isn't it\n[laughter] it's the only place I've been

November second at ten pm\n[noise] this is kind of like a cooking show with guns were the chefs show up and they don't know what they're going to make right\n[noise] yeah pretty much we've got three contestants every episode and they they come to our armor and they get a quick jot challenge and out of the talent that they have to make in front of the judges and they've got anywhere between three and six hour depending on what the challenge as\nI have to make a functional battle ready weapon by the end of that and then after that\nRound are leaks doubted author fire ... decaf that I've been out at the ultimately a deliberate eliminate one of the contestants and then the ... you can go into a math challenge but did they warned HR as a much bigger\nA more complicated Web ad and they've got more to it to make that and one of our workshop\nAt the end of the four days a three judge it leaks out and myself we go out and yell and meet up with our friends that ... is a former special operations diaper and he asked the weapons out in the field and that ... one of those two people to be titled master alarms and they went ten thousand dollars\n[noise] cool give us an idea of I mean obviously they're not going to make like a full blown modern gun like out of a chunk of metal or they\nWell they they depend on eleventh actually look at our weapons are historic so they could act yeah yeah completely for average day I still are my age or something even when you watch the trailer that if we go out very odd but they do let me in a in the show they make fire on\nA but then they make flat lot fire and different types of combination weapon but uh sometimes they'll have the barrel the insights\nThe barrel gorgeous back a car into what air making putting together general down I

... how old they gather it pretty effect Oculus\nYeah and I guess depends upon the level of hurt\nTo ask Dr ... also depends on how reactive a person is\nYeah yeah well and there's some cases where um if you're in a at a relationship but it's toxic words abuse of the first thing you need to do is make sure the abuse stop so maybe you start with the action of just getting out but then once you have that once you have that separation than you can sit and process it\nSo I only say when you have relational issues and you go into separation our divorce is just like reliving the same relationship but backwards\nAnd umpire okay\nIn order to heal you got to have to relive it but she was going to have to go back in time you got to cut back backwards and you're going to do it separately\nOkay oh that's good so um you know so the ideas is that you basically say okay and then separation so it's kinda like you you get away from that influence because when you're in it you can't really see it\nCannot down your vision is definitely different\nWhen you're outside of it that's just how some people can say you know if well from the outside looking in mhm I see a different\nYou know and then you um so you you need to have that time of of separation 'em and kind of being alone with yourself is that you know or ... or anything and\nUm how long does that process takes or is it that is mostly a applied to relationships uh or you know\nYeah and then I ended it with self\nCare okay you know they say ... whether you are in a relationship or outside of a relationship and you have to be okay with you you have to love you you have to make sure they you're okay so that when you do enter into a relationship you're going to be okay whether that relationship fans of fall\nYeah I was a coached after my divorce to say you know one of my service like okay you need to go six months without having any relationships and you're gonna you're gonna look back on that time is being the hardest time but the best time for yourself a lot of self awareness\nAnd of course I'm a you know as I talked about earlier I'm a skip to the un kind of person just you know Barry life you know I was still operating the mode burying my anger burying my fear and so I started dating while I I figure that no one would say yes to go out with me\nSo I just I said it's going to take at least six months for that to happen so I started asking right away and the the first woman I asked out and they said yes and then there I was back in a relationship again with the same person St personality that I've been married to before so my\nOne of the guys that I you know sit down and have coffee with and we talk about this and say you know if you had gone from a twenty seven year relationship that ended up badly and into a perfect one right after that I would've said there's no way that could happen so uh when I finally did get around to doing that separation part and being by myself and learning how to do the self care kind of things\nBoy that made a huge difference oh well that's a blessing women and stuff like that's really what Jane what changed my life\nSo after you go for a living living backwards through your relationship that's\nThat's gotta be that's got to be difficult I realize that you know I was following your book without even knowing it because you know that's what that's what my therapist had me do as well and um [noise]\nBoy you uncover things and I and I think doing it backwards to is important because you know I don't remember you don't remember stuff but if you go back in time that way than you know you realize oh well this was happening now\nBecause I Love to find the origin of things\nYeah where did where it gets that stemmed from ... why are you that way yeah what makes you respond that way and when you begin to even when I work with my clients yeah um when I called him I happen to do life experiences sure what happened to you between the age if one in fact\nWell yeah ... ... and when you begin to uncover that then you get signed the route to\nYeah okay this is why you're thirty or this is why you're fifty and you're still feel this way because of what happened to you at five yeah what happened to you and your team\nYeah you know what I always say that you know your family knows how to push your buttons but they also develop your buttons that's why the ... and a lot of times you don't even know you just react to things yeah\nSo when you say clients then I'm so using the book as a template then do you coach people through yes yeah it does that affiliated I mean is that just your own business or is it ...\nIt's my own business paradigm shifts okay\nAlright paradigm shift and what's the uh is it like a website does it say\nEverything is

are\nAre they attacked orders tempted kidnapping or a carjacking or an ATM robbery or whatever\nAnd we see what they do it's kind of interesting to see how they react because people think they know what they're going to do your will they think\nThey know what we're going to do and we kind of know what they're going to do and so as a result we set up the scenarios to fool them to trick them we offer diversions we give them red herrings if you will know that's not really the bad guy but you know the bad guy is\nAnd then when it starts to shooting starts and it gets real interesting real fast

because somebody sat back shooting you know got gun shooting at the end of the day at the range of going\nThere you know it'd be cool yeah\nAnd then they start a new to an end meal where most people would say no that's not possible there's always somebody said well maybe it is maybe that is possible the truth of it is firearms have pretty much always come from ...\nOriginally it was locked makers are like clocks miss because they were the only ones who could make the inter good works that required for firearm action and so we called the action part go walk\nAnd from that we get the in the English idiom the phrase to lock stock and barrel which means the action to stock and barrel lock stock and barrel we use that phrase all the time that kind of mean well if you're getting everything you're going to get the whole thing lock stock and barrel robbers these teachers that came up with this stuff\nThat's where we got a lot of our guns over the years over the centuries actually pretty

I don't know I mean there may be a an existing list somewhere I just don't have it\nBut I'd love to get your first hand reports on museums you've been to that you thought were cool now one is just down ... down the street but very local to us here in New Orleans area as World War two museums started as a de de museum\nThat increased the Pacific and everything else it's now the world war two museum and it's world class definitely worth going to but what are the museums you had been to\nWhere you found that they had an interesting collection of God's wouldn't necessarily have to be a fire on a machine gun museum a place where you went and went to that that's a cool display um you know there are a number of them around the country so we'd love to get your reports on that [noise]\nOkay let me find the story because this one was interesting to to to do this for hours to make sure I started to beginning\n[noise] what's new is old again we're told his new again the gun ban industry has\nI Would say rediscovered but all they they just bring back the stuff they never give up when you think oh yeah okay they're off that they're never awesome banning\nAnything they just switched to the things that they think they can get the moment well turns out for whatever reason it crushed me on this they coordinate their back to ammunition\nWhy would they do that well they're saying well you know we may not be able to ban guns but without any ... won't be any good it won't be able to do anything okay and then\nThey start it's it's interesting how they'll start with the premise like that well if we could just regulate ammunition and of course they've done a lot of states where you have to have a license to base\n\nStamped mom look\n\nThis is going to talk to you like to join the ... gun or Tom's wholesome all things going on with more news as we go forward with\nThe British news for you right now you may have heard of this you may not\nBut there's a a really exciting new TV show just about to start features guns and weapons of many different types and joining us right now is one of our\nDear old friends or a frequent guest here on gun talk ... she is the chief curator of the ... museum in Cody, Wyoming I actually how are you\nI'm doing well John how are you on your grave when you were just right before he got on our said hey you know we'll talk about some of the different museums around the country that have firearms on we ought to be able to live and all of that\nAnd you ask people holding them you know what's your favorite one is the first caller's Cody that's the one man and the guy says but you're going to be three or four days just plan on that oh that's\nToo funny and I didn't even pay the person to say that\nI Know I Know when you are you still in the middle of doing renovations and re models and everything right now\nOh my gosh yes we are in the middle of the construction and I'm actually betting content for the new museum today and we did just installed last week a really large about five hundred guns in it\nA temporary exhibition at the news the at them for the time if you will\nUh back in the first location that was it that by the end at the center that won the election came at a Nineteen seventies and they built the first museum which are called the Winchester aren't easy and it was actually under our buffalo bell museum and so we have temporary exhibition that harkens back\nTo that original museum are working on the construction of the main footprint of the ... are they are and we'll be reopening July fix twenty Nineteen\n[noise] July six twenty Nineteen sounds like a really good excuse to have a party\nI I Know fourth of July museums and for those who don't know fourth of July in Cody, Wyoming is the trust me on this\nOh it's really hard and it's a hundredth anniversary a stampede next year as well as our professional rodeo that comes through town and so it's going to be a week long celebration at all culminating ultimately at our opening on Saturday\nWell that would be the time to get your hotel room so that was that yes [laughter] so crucial\nDiscovery Channel has a new TV series about guns and other types of on them and you are a big part of it tell people what's going on with the name of it is\nYes the show is called master of arms and it is a a weapon making competition show and on the show you've got late as gun met and blacksmith\nTo kind of show up and they have no idea what they're making that day and they could be a challenge to make a gun to make a buck oh or or a blade and it's really exciting I'm actually one of the judges on the show and the historical weapons expert on the show and after marathon November second at ten pm\nThis is kind of like a cooking show with guns were the shift show up and they don't know what they're going to make right\nYeah it's pretty much we've got three contestants every episode and they they come to our armor and they get a quick draw challenge and that is a challenge that they have to make in front of the judges and they've got anywhere between three and six hours depending on what the challenges\nAnd they have to make a functional battle ready weapon by the end of that and after that round\nOur host the stout he's the author ... IQ tests that up and down at the ultimately a deliberate eliminate one of the contestants and then the ... you can go into a math challenge or did they born day challenge so much bigger\nA more complicated weapon and they've got more to it to make that and one of our workshop\nAnd at the end of the four days of the three judge it speaks out ... and myself we go out to the field and meet up with our friends that Nicholas Irving is a former special operations diaper and he asked the weapons out in the field and that we select one of those two people to be titled master of arms and they went ten thousand dollars\nWho give us some idea of I mean obviously they're not going to make like a full blown modern gone like out of a chunk of metal or they\nWell they print the depend on eleven actually look at our weapons are historic so they could have\nTo you know completely for its jail I force or a blade or something even when you watch the trailer you'll notice me out so very odd straight but they do I mean they in the show they make firearm\nA but then they make split lot fire and different types of combination weapons but uh sometimes they'll have the barrel the inside of the barrel gorgeous back but their car into what they're making putting together ... down there doing a lot of work on these weapons\nSounds like you've lined up some really a top level crafts men or are there any women could mean\nThey're they're they're the one that on the show uh the guy that was pretty amazing got on the show it\nIt really impressive because I'm a total book nerd and\nI one of the things that I decided when I became a U.S was that\nI wanted to know how the ... of the ... one of the best way to do that is to learn how to shoot a historic and modern got so I've always kind of how the practical application to my study of history but I haven't had a chance to really make a lot of early in the past\nThat getting to watch these craftsmen had a few modern and old techniques together is is pretty spectacular\n\nI was getting a divorce UK\nAnd recently met a wonderful woman and a specially avenue addict in my\n\nYou know I always told myself and then you're between my ex wife and I was going to\nHappen when we're being very big part of my okay and she was raising a family but never really was taught about extradition trampolines yesterday\nAnd ... percent\nNow no she she don't weirdo like you she leapt\nDominant right and it's good that was all of a different kind of work with but um but yeah\nLet me let me ask you that that was she a shooter before you met her she'd been around ... really a shooter\nAround them but never really\nKnow her father took her out and about ... a little bit this year in the area [noise] but ah but never but you know she always wanted to go hunting and things like that but she never really push the subject in her father never pushed on her and uh so now yeah now she's one of the bird hunting with me she wants to learn about deer hunting\nUm she just died of an ad and then really love\nWhat that's really interesting how did you first broach the subject\nWell you know I just just to normal conversation are brought up another deer hunter man then next thing I Know we're just everything out or you know she had an interesting thing is and you don't usually people who can tend to be the same mindset assures as well\nYeah\nYeah yeah just just kind of you know everything outdoors you understand and um it just came up and she said you know I've always been interested in that and a range and she broke a couple turned looked at me smiled real big and I like it\nAnymore [laughter] so\nShe's um she's five three um six one am I going to do that very well at all nope nope but um but I did tell her like you know will ah oh I can do different stock because I actually just remember like about the credit off into the beeping on and on I chose the BP\nNo I uh I got it so now my old trapped gun I'm I'm probably going to be funny a shorter stuck there for\nAll right I'm going to make a suggestion to think about pets okay remember that just putting a short stock on it doesn't do it\nFor a number of reasons or one is that\nThe barrels maybe longer maybe a little heavy a look at the percentage of weight of a gun at one of your guns versus your weight and then versus her weight imagine using that percentage on you so you might be carrying a twelve or sixteen pounds gun to pursue the same percentage of weight\nSo that's something to think about another is if she shooting off the left shoulder\nYou try to get a gun suited to hurt it will make all the difference in the world for shot guns and then obviously you can get her out and do some pistol shooting it's ripe for shooting you're going to have a whole bunch of flying in front of you look I oh congratulations\nOn finding somebody who sounds like a real good for you Justin I'm excited for you and I wish you two are nothing but a lot of good shooting a lot of fun and that's a great life together appreciates report that is great\nEight six six gun a year range reports about we're looking for ... years you've been to we have a couple of those coming up as well as pretty much any other also you're signing\nThe season [noise]\n\n\nWith\nThe alliance Louisa upper Michigan halo ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Gun Talk", "city":
