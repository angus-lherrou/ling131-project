[noise]\n\nYou know pick it up to\n... falls here winters come real fast [laughter] oh one of the things I Do with\nMy blink or cameras up kind of set up by a remote cabins so they've got a cool deal I've got a um [noise]\nYou can read the temperature drops amount of built in so with my remote app on my phone I can see what the temperature is inside and outside got a camera inside it's gotten alert system on it and I could say that so if the temperature goes below a certain number and I set it up would ever want to be\nI get an alert and I know that something has happened to the powers going out that he's gone on to that but the power but the heat has gone out and the cabins getting too cold\nWhich could end up freezing the pipes and like a column neighbor and had to go take a look at\nIt just one of the interesting side benefits I guess because you get to blink cameras system for security you weren't able to see if there's somebody snooping around your house you get these alerts on your phone you could live video you can see what's going on you could punch you in watching a live video anytime you want it saves clips for you\nAnd I mean that's the older you want this alert before something happens if somebody has outside your house to get one which is ... doing\n... imagine if you had your family inside your way you could call them and say there's somebody outside you guys you know ... has been sections for the call nine one one whatever\nUh at the same time there were these other benefits whether it's seeing if somebody's left a package for you are finding out there's critters walking around and I certainly do that as well\nI got to tell you I Love this system is just the coolest thing as long as the cameras the real simple to set up their work on the Internet they work I'll go right to your phone you've got a phone app which as simple as that can be now a blink gives ... uh Amazon company\nIt works with Alex's of course you can get three blink cameras for way less than what the other guys charging to get an extra Fifteen Percent off for being a gun talk Lester just go to ... protect dot com slash gun talk that's blink protect dot com slash gun talk or\nIt's cool stuff [noise]\n[noise] I'm I'm looking at getting ready for I'm going to be deer hunting ended next week getting almost effort got my rifle a mammal hall slightly and it's interesting I went with a scope that might surprise people\nMight be hunting in a Idaho hung out west there so long distances and I have a scope at the top magnification on his his six\nPower people out there using your four to ... board at sixteen power were lots of magnification here I Am popping out six power what's that about well I can remember when everybody hunted out west the fixed for power scope that was the deal\nIf you've never tried it here's something fun to eat a trial which you're cool scope senators for power if you have a chance to shoot out at three or four hundred yards and do some shooting I think you may be surprised if you're used to crank it way up high magnification you say well look small okay so what\nIt doesn't matter where it looks like can you hear what you're aiming at\nAnd you're gonna find that at four or five or six power hitting a deer at three or four hundred yards is just not difficult\nWhy would you well you probably heard me say for a long time I'm a real fan of the\nScopes that are in the low magnification range wonder if I have two to six that level why is that well depending on where you are and if you're in an area where you like walk through the woods keep it on the lowest power that\nWay if do jumps up right in front of you could throw that rifle lucky both eyes open and one more than half or two power you can basically it's it's as fast as it can be it's as fast as red dye it's crazy how fast it is now if you had to cranked up to six power eight power nine power no forget about not going to happen\nSo basically I keep my scope of the lowest power\nUntil I Need more power\nSo I mean if something's out there at three or four hundred yard just ... you have time to crank the scope of\nI mean that's what I Do [noise] so just kind of a thought for hunters\nIt's basically just drive to these groups that she took to the trick shooting\n[laughter] so it\nSounds like what you're saying is that there's this might be a good option that kind of a hot for taking some veterans who don't have mobility\nExactly and the only problem I shoot with a little on the expense to write about five dollars [noise] push tags much\n[laughter]\nWell you know it's it's a worthwhile thing to do and we can find hunts like that it works I don't know I look I appreciate the call is a great idea [noise] one of the things I've been in the press with us with the Harvard group\nOr they were just talking with Tom Paine about last hour is they designed people have some really cool systems for getting some of our veterans wounded veterans out into the or whether it's a track vehicle\nOr a tree stand that is powered so that you can get them in their in a wheelchair it will electronic ... lift them up and get them up Fifteen twenty feet up so they are now in a tree stand\nIt's just there's a lot of cool systems out there and ways to get people in the field it's it's pretty slick and very worthwhile\nLet's see oh I Want Charles with us out of California journals you're on TALK\nGood afternoon said by the leaves have that I thought was outstanding and a lot of people don't know about too much about World War one but you sure learn a lot yeah you go to the world war one Memorial Museum and Kansas City Missouri\nAnd what's interesting as a course at war was mostly caught in the trenches\nAnd their museum is laid out a lot of cat walks me to go through and look down in the trenches and actually you feel like you're down there in the war itself\nBut they have some of the best guys they had a ... a child or a sniper I told that I didn't even know the ad back to World War one I think much of a four foot barrel on it\nIt's unbelievable seamless way probably forty pounds [noise] give\nYou a terrific museum I've been to the world war one museum you ever been in the world war two museum in New Orleans in World War one museum in Kansas City is every bit the equivalent of that\nUh you remember when you go

A. Y. N. E. S. versus United States\nIt's actually ha I guess I'm starting to ... and you're right I see while you're right I'm Sorry I Apologize and go ...\nSome nail is is\nYou cannot hold criminals legally responsible in other words you can't prosecute them for noncompliance with any little gun control law you come up with because that violates their Fifth Amendment right against self recrimination\nSpecifically you cannot require a criminal to register his gun because their registration of it would be admitting that he's not not allowed to own it\nSo that would be self incriminate ... in this case in this Nineteen sixty eight case it was somebody with a ... a a prohibited something you'd have to register under the national firearms act\nGot prosecuted and the court says will actually if you if you were to register it then that would expose him as a criminal and that self incriminate nation and we have a law that says you can't require somebody to incriminate himself so no\nRegistry gun registration laws do not apply to criminals and when they say to people that it's like their heads explored\nThat's also why you hear about a only use the stereotype Chicago\n... gets busted with an A. K. and they say in Chicago you can't have that but what are they charging with felon in possession they don't say oh you violated the anti gun laws no no no no\nYou're a felon with possession because the cops and the da's office no we try to do it for this all his lawyer that's what they have them there goes that\nYeah it is an interesting thing when people are saying well you know we need to read sure guns in there were so are you do understand that you cannot require felons\nPeople who are prohibited from owning a gun to register their guns your work so that really the only people you want to require to register guns are law abiding people that tend to stop and they go well no that's not right and they were just telling you hang versus us Nineteen sixty eight\nIt says that itself from combination to require someone who can own a gun to register a gun\nAnd so you can't require that so the bottom line on it is that gun registration laws apply all new to the law body and then their heads go just spinning around like Linda Blair and The Exorcist\nIf you're in or nearing retirement it's time to keep your money safe from fees risk and inflation as well as market risk call

get together and just goof off as much as we'd like this thing\nRight now with my very good friend longtime friend re Elgin a former competitive shooter a an icon up the firearms industry or at federal cartridge that loophole you've consulted with a whole bunch of the companies in the business\nYou've been around guns pretty much all your life that I'm about fifty years time actually so far so good you worked in the gun stored in the early on\nTo college I worked fulltime a forty five hours a week through college at a sporting goods gun shop hustler gunshots\nWere there any lessons that came from working in a gun shop the kind of helps you through your whole career in the farms industrial\nAbsolutely a learned so much about consumer demand about merchandising uh when when after a while and you walk into a store you start saying things that most people don't say oh yeah and and the understand how\nThe layout should work and what types of in return they they manage and\nAnd it's a it was it an extraordinary learning experience and then we traded and sold so many guns today oh I just learned such a wide variety of guns now from owning them from dealing with the Manhattan passing through your hands and having to no answer having to be able to answer questions\nWhen people ask you questions it's up to you to figure out the answer so that you just always doing research\n... yeah and it was just a marvel to start into the shooting industry\nSpeaking you know if you're a gun person man or woman really like guns actually getting a job at a gun store probably would be kinda cool\nWell I I have suggested that too many many people who have aspirations to be in the gun industry the shooting industry\nSo if you weren't like say I want to work for a gun company maybe a background of a few years working at a gun store be a good place to start\nAbsolutely it and so many young people that I interviewed a that that were wanted so badly beaten industry said oh I just I just love the ... well ... there's more to it\nYeah so do I but that's not the job [laughter] well we had a a fun time yesterday were out er and for those who don't know we've got a little place a cabinet in Idaho we're out here playing right now and\nUh we went out right now are four wheelers and your TVs and we took was close to forty mile run yesterday's man just thirty seven miles and miles up in the mountains and all that\nAnd pretty much I Would think if we had five I think that's five vehicles I pretty much everybody there at least in every vehicle I Know there were firearms and they may have been far enough arms there for everybody who was there I Believe so more than likely so what were you uh what was it that long case that you had your\nSalad I told you it was a four thousand five hundred and Seventy so that's a nice caliber some people call it a forty five Seventy but that's if they don't know what they're talking to you know of course I have I'm Marlon all ever again\nBut you have stuff strapped on the stock was all that\nThat was that was raised my head up I've got us\n... on it which is extremely fast if you have never shot a scouts go yeah they are so\nQuick it's up both eyes open rifle scope and then you throw that thing up and it just pops into your vision\nAnd and it it's a it's a marvelous dangerous game rifle because it's so fast and you'll ... you'll acquire the target so quickly right and and so I ... yes I did put some ... on the stock to raise my head up so that it's in the very second it touches my cheek touches the stock I'm looking through the scope\nIt's kind of like having a shotgun foods that you are ... for those who have no re shot a couple of three targets in his life like I Would say a couple of hundred thousand but that would be short by about a factor of ten million yeah a little over ... over a million or\nSo when you put the pattern the stock you raise your head up so that when you put the rifle to your stock you're not having to move your head around to be able to see through the scope\nExactly it it's very much like shooting a shotgun instinctively going and uh and I you know tried it out many times until I got just exactly the right fit so that the second that that stock touches my shoulder at my cheek touches the the stock I'm looking right through the scope it's instant\nI'm just thinking you know a lot of people don't know about that and they get a rifle scopes I get to do a rifle whatever and then when they showed read a lot of times your cheek to stock and then you have to pick your head up to be able to see through the scope right exactly\nExactly and that's why so many people have a problem acquiring a target they see a target out a hundred yards they see it through their binoculars or whatever and they put the gun to their shoulder and then their search them asset I Can't find it mhm and ah\nThere's too many variables that got the head moving around trying to actually see an image to the scope as much as anything exactly\nSo there are a lot of ways to go about if it's all first of all in most cases tried old mattress scope as low as possibly exactly and have the action work right okay and if that's not working then you can raise your eye\nWith the application of mold skin if you need a little bit just over the top of the stock or they're actually like strap on pads and things you can get precisely\nAnd here's another trick that a lot of people aren't aware of that I've taught countless people if they have trouble acquiring a target in the ... first of all you got a little power yeah clearly that's always start low\nPower and that that same that should be more obvious than it is but the other thing is you bring you even\nBring the rifle up almost to your shoulder and have the target directly over the scope over the top of his job you're looking over the top of the scope and then you just bring the scope to your eye and there it is both\nSo a deal is you don't try to look at the ... do you look at the target and left the scope intercept your vision\nVery well but I I've been working on that [laughter] that's exactly what I'm Talking about yeah and I've tried I've taught people to do that and I said oh wow there yes\n[laughter] yes look at a target and let the scope intercept your vision just bring it up to keep staring at the target don't try to look at the scope ... that's when it gets hard to find something out exactly yeah but yeah to your point if you've ever variable scope keeping on low power pretty much all the time until you absolutely need the higher\nPower exactly as always always always carry in the field on low power right so you can find that are always crank it up if you have to write you got to find the target\nFor if you have it on to power and that big bucks jumps up ten feet from you start running off just waved to if you're going to do that you could just yell or something yeah that's right ... thanks for the show I appreciate that\nWow oh oh I Know one of the things that you said in a when you teach ... is the same young woman just\nAnd you were going to get a lot of advice when you add the rain the different bug but then when you're young young girls you talk to shoot and it just for those you know\nAnd when you get there people are going to be trying to help you out oh you need to shoot it this way are you shooting behind you're not leaving it was always you're not leaving your if you should pull the trigger before the ... was thrown they'd still so you're not leaving [laughter]\nIsn't that the truth [laughter]\nSo I talk for just to say about a minute about the concept of lead is speed or speed is ... well\n... ... this came about it so much in skate shooting where the old timers and say this station is a two foot laid this was a three foot lead that was a four foot laid well that's\nBS I'm Sorry but uh it it's how fast you're moving the barrel and there are people like waiting may is who you can stand behind and watch him shoot skeet he's was probably the world's greatest ever ... and it looks like he should and behind the target\nLike he's part of the trigger while they're still behind the target yeah but the bills are moving that fast arrow is\nMoving so fast that he is building the lead in and he knows how to do it and and so the only time that works is was a sustained league which means you have to know exactly where the darkness at all times which you can do that and ... but then you ... you get off that field and ... you're in a sporting clays field you can hit the ground\nFor hunting forget about it absolutely you know so it it's ... it's barrel speed\nSo when somebody says well that's about a two foot lead just take that and throw it away and out of your mind if you just say not just thank you very much appreciate that and then flush it out of your brain exact and just the speed barrels be built and the other thing that happens if you're sick and barrel speed it makes you a really hard to stop your barrel yes\nBecause when you stop you barrels that's a hundred percent guaranteed you were going to every time\nAnd that is the number one if I had to pick one thing that people do as a mistake shooting a shotgun on flying targets uh-huh as I stopped again they get to their their rifle shooter so they want that target to hold still\nExactly so if\nI see some of these uh compared to ... exaggerate their follow through ... and and that is that a way of making sure you keep swimming a barrel\nThrough well part of it is I don't teach that but no but I you know but you do need to follow through them but yes absolutely positively and and uh\nAnd if some people are very accomplished at that and they've got that system down for their particular style I don't teach a surge at the end right or some some people do right some people do teach that\nAll right the other thing is a good week shooting instructor commit all the difference\nDo it and you're just you'd be amazed how my home I did was it could change your whole your whole shooting last ... change to like ... thank you so much for probably ... back in later in the show some work for different we're open lines if you'd like to call the district's\nGonna come back when we talk about gun fighting and are you what's going\nAround the wife

in a lot of ways and for a lot of individuals who looked at that and said you know\n[noise] sweetie we may have to think about getting the gun\nAnd for a lot of people it was a changing point it really was one of the people who have seen that in his work is Ken Campbell he is the director of operations to hit ... out of the gunfight academy in Arizona can join just right now and how you doing\n[noise] Tom it's always good to be on their way up your while\n... excellent appreciate and appreciate everything you guys do out there uh [noise] it's interesting I mean and I know what your extensive law enforcement background you may kind of sometimes wonder why would\nWhy would it take an event like nine eleven to have people realize that they need to take care of themselves but sometimes it does and sometimes people just kind of neat that wakeup call don't they\nDid that take that away you know got to talk about that for many years on on being prepared whether it's is famous metal prepared to lecture or going on it until you need to be prepared for preventive or watch a live or even going back my old days as a boy scout you know be prepared nut\nUnfortunately sometimes it takes a significant light that they get people to realize\nThe world may not be applied and apply as I watch thought it was that there's a couple from Phoenix that come to mind there are many many many time over against students and they became ... will let you will after a good friend of theirs during a robbery was mark\nAnd a husband and wife are multiple guns I graduate their their regular competitors it locked matches both their sons are our regular clients of our students of ours and they also shoot competitively but it took that\nSignificant a bat and good rant murder 'em to really get them to wake up and that's been twenty five thirty years ago\nAnd I know that happens on a regular basis where you get people that come to gun site which for those who don't know gun site is a training academy it's a shooting school it's a gun fighting school\nOr in pulled in Arizona where the north of Prescott a little bit or you can learn to shoot pistols rifles shotguns or it teaches you an awful lot not exactly marksman ship although that's a part of it it's an awful lot of pieces of parts but all I Want to say\nI Know that you get people who come there where\nThey have been assaulted or somebody they know it's been assaulted or somebody who's been murdered\nDo you see in those students a difference maybe a more of a sense of purpose perhaps than what the average student\nWithout fail a they tend to us to learn how to fight to change change how they look at things because\nThe world their world has changed so they come here what that dedicated mindset and they leave with a big smile on their face usually at but they leave with that empowerment that sense\nOf wellbeing that if something happens to me I my awareness to know seven principles a personal defense my awareness should make me alert to that I may be able to simply walk across the street and avoid it\nOr if the why does why I can face it it'd be\nInteresting you say that because\nPeople who don't know people have not been to gun either one of the good trading schools out there and there are a number of them they think well you're going there because you really want to shoot somebody you want to learn how to shoot somebody and then people who come out of the first five day class it's been my experience that\nThey will work harder than ever in their lives to avoid that situation because now they have a very real world appreciation for what it's all about\nWithout fail a that that\nThat Wednesday morning lecture on by that is probably the most important lecture you get a gun site because it teaches you that color code in those seven friends over parts of all the ads and makes you alert and aware so again instead of walking down the street like so many people are what their head in there I found\nOut what I Want to say anything other than that in their head in there I I\nI'm politely on aware of what's going on around them and that criminal\nIs out there waiting sitting there thinking that's going to be an easy target when they come out of gun site they're headed up their alert or looking around and that criminal if that thing else thinks you know all white there'll be an easy one for\nOur people see this bad guy or recognize something that is that that sense that women's intuition that air stand your neck they recognize that I think I Need to go across the street\nAnd their Ronald McDonald house used in a medical centers go into a remodeling and she'd like everything down there is yeah he's lacking right now she called us and said I Know I'm going to lose my laundry for about nine to ten minutes or so\nWould you guys be interested at crossroads doing the laundry for our residents\nAnd what you're talking about there is beds Los ... right [noise]\nSo we said sure she said well how much do you want to charge me and I said well that's the time I was serving as a board chair said let me go back to the board and we'll come back so the U.S talk to the board and we decided that we would charge nothing yeah\nAnd the purpose of that was to do what I Would call the proof of concept sure in other words we had to demonstrate to ourselves and to run down the house that we could do this work at the qualities that they want it so we went back to barter and said Bob I Will do it will do it for free we're going to pay people\nBut we won't charge you rush said are you sure and I said yes and well then end result was\nThey sent us three newer washers and three new a drier lie that were worth probably three thousand dollars or more it it's a break even situation and so we were able to demonstrate it over the next nine months that we could do the job with the people that work come to work here\nYeah and then the real profit is that these three people now have you have a pace doesn't really\nYou know we were talking and I I didn't realize you know how important that taste of it [laughter] because you know you can't qualify to get an apartment she thinks I defy for any credit or whatever and have you know uh to be able to say hey you know I've got a I've got a job as the as the starting point to getting\nAll the regular all the things that we take for granted in our day to day life you know that we have like a VIP trust who you are all the time I think you know\nIf it means you can demonstrate material el evidence that you are not just taken a hand right you are willing to contribute and make a contribution and this is one of many things that has to be checked off but it's a big one if you got a check for that\nYou had to shut up and and that's the that's the other thing I think as a as a whole horrible\nI'm you know a missed comprehension about um folks who are on the street\nIs that there are people are on the street if people are on the street and homeless by choice normally that means they have some mental illness or something like that I ... the also\nYou know the vast majority of people who are homeless are are homeless and they've been homeless for a short period of time and there's been one tragic life changing event that's happened whether it's a job loss or medical condition or\nYou know just via also lives are lost in life yeah and uh you know all these things that happened you know and all of us are just you know\nA re check away from being right out there that all the time come crashing down so you know and the the you know misconception people have is they say oh well he's homeless people are out there and they're just they're just not they're not exerting ourselves the way I did you know or or whatever and that's just not true and even before I came\nTo crossroads Steven and I was ashamed about my comment here but I was one of those folks that most outlines why don't you just go get a job\nYeah you know you're you got all this time on your hands while they just go work right now and the thing about it is that it's it's hard to find a job you know it is hard to find a job even if you're not homeless you know and then there's the today's market\nMy uh [noise] you know I have a you know no no\nYoung men and women that are in their twenties and they're just they take a long time to find a job and it's not easy to do\nIt if you're living on the street the chances of getting a job\nOr you know diminish very dramatically German accent and civil laundry provided um none of these individuals have a way of basically did outta exact\nOff the street there was another outgrowth of that and there's a ... organization called urban strategies is collaborating with first United Methodist church in Pasadena\nA very interesting it's disturbing to stick to me is that there's thirty thousand displaced ... state of Texas today was criticizing with no place to sleep no place to stay right\nSo thirty thousand in the final number and so they the churches dedicate a second story of their a youth wing to shelter in a third Thirteen to Seventeen year old boys and if you think about\nAdoption yeah these are not they're not going to not be a\nNo yeah that was when they were my kids when they were younger they were definitely out but there was that the the the teenage years for they're\nNot adopted so what first whatever's strategies has come to us and ask us would we do their laundry you know this is close towels and sheets and everything\nAnd because we had the confidence of doing that worked for Ronald McDonald first stuff yeah and we said yes and they came over and looked at our facility and said you got to contract\nAnd it's not a money maker we we pay minimum wage and we putting people to work you know just a few that on this for a\nWhile and I think that's you know I'm One of the things that you know I hear about well you know you know what I imagine would be\nKind of push back or the downside for crossroads as well this is a steady state kind of thing what you're doing is you're just you're given out to the same people week after week you're giving 'em stuff and and and you know you're not really helping them up\nBut then you have ideas stories like this one ideas like this and so really crossroads is kind of move you're always going to be there to provide laundry in the shower for somebody to get clean I think that's a core thing but you're seeing how that expands another exile in and hopefully it will continue to grow and and you'll be able to employ a lot more people and we'll\nGo for what I guess we just get them coughing to build their confidence builder dignity and let these people know that they have or if they are we want to embrace them as were the members of our community that is what we're trying to do\nAll right so um we're out of time so let's just for the last thing if people want to know more if they want to get involved with crosswords doing where should they go\nThey should go to our website WWW dot crossroads at park place all one word dot org dot org ... ... that we'd love to see and hear from

part of the actual here just give us a holler we're having a much fun as we always tend to do we kind of\nFun we get together just fall as much as this thing\nRight now with my very good friend a long time ... a former competitive shooter a and I kind of the firearms industry a federal cartridge that loophole you've consulted with a whole bunch of the companies in the business\nYou've been around guns pretty much all your life huh yeah about fifty years time actually so far so good you worked in a gun store did early on\nThrough college I worked full time uh forty five hours a week through college at a sporting goods gun shop hustling gun shop\nWhether any lessons that came from working at a gun shop to kind of helped you through your whole career in the farms industrial\nAbsolutely a learned so much about consumer demand about merchandising uh when when after a while when you walk into a store you start saying things that most people don't say oh yeah and and you understand how\nThe layout should work and what types of inventory they they manage and and it's a it was an extraordinary learning experience and then we traded to insult so many guns and I\nOh I just learned such a wide variety of guns now from owning them from dealing with the Manhattan passing through your hands and having to no answer having to be able to answer questions\nWhen people ask me questions it's up to you to figure out the interest so that you're just always doing research\nExactly yeah and it was just a marvel to start into the shooting industry\nSpeaking you know if you're a a gun person man or woman if you really like guns actually getting a job at a gun store probably would be kinda cool well\nI I have suggested that too many many people who have aspirations to be in the gun industry they're shooting industry\nSo if you weren't like say I want to work for gun company maybe a background of a few years working at a gun store be a good place to start\nAbsolutely it and so many young people that I interviewed a that that were wanted so badly to be an industry said oh I just I just love to hunt well ... there's more to it\nSo do I but that's not the job that we had a a fun time yesterday were out and for those who don't know we've got a little place a cabinet in Idaho we're out here playing right now and\nUh we went out right now four wheelers and your TVs and we took was close to forty mile run yesterday's man just thirty seven miles and miles up in the mountains and all that\nAnd pretty much I Would think if we had five I think that five vehicles I pretty much everybody there at least in every vehicle I Know there were firearms and you may have been far enough arms there for everybody who was there I Believe so more than likely so what were you uh what was it that long case that you had yours\nI thought that was a four thousand five hundred and Seventy so that's a nice caliber some people call it a forty five Seventy but that's if they don't know what they're talking to you know of course I have I'm Marlon will ever again then to go out\nBut she had stuff strapped on the stock was all that\nThat was that was raised my head up I've got a scouts go up on it which is extremely fast if you have never shot a scouts go yeah they are so\nQuick it's both eyes open rifle scope that man you throw that thing up and it just pops into your vision\nAnd and it it's a it's a marvelous dangerous game rifle because it's so fast and you'll ... you'll acquired the target so quickly right and and so I ... yes I did put some ... on the stock to raise my head up so that it's in the very second it touches my cheek touches the stock I'm looking through the scope\nIt's kind of like having a shotgun fitted ... for those who would not raise shot a couple of targets in his life like I Would say a couple of hundred thousand but that would be short by about a factor of ten million yeah a little over ... over a million other guy\nSo when you put the pattern the stock you raise your head up so that when you put the rifle to your stock you're not having to move your head around to be able to see through the scope\nExactly it it's very much like shooting a shotgun instinctively and uh and I you know tried it out many times until I got just exactly the right fit so that the second that that stock touches my shoulder and my cheek touches a the stock I'm\nLooking right through the scope it's instant\nI'm just thinking you know a lot of people don't know about that and they get a rifle scopes I get to do a rifle whatever and then when they showed read a lot of times your cheek to stock and then you have to pick your head up to be able to see through the scope right exactly\nExactly and that's why so many people have a problem acquiring a target they see a target out a hundred yards they say it's sort of their binoculars or whatever and they put the gun to their shoulder and then their search your master I Can't find it mhm and\nIt's too many variables that got the head moving around trying to actually see an image to the scope as much as anything exactly\nSo there are a lot of ways to go about if it's all first of all in most cases tried old mattress scope as low as possibly exactly and have the action work right okay and if that's not working then you can raise your eye\nWith the application of mold skin if you need a little bit just over the top of the stock or they're actually strap on pads and things you can\nGet precisely and here's another trick that a lot of people aren't aware of that I've taught countless people if they have trouble acquiring a target in the ... first of all you got a little power clear ... always start low power and that that same that should be more obvious than it is but\nThe other thing is you bring it even bring the rifle up almost to your shoulder and\nHave the target directly over the scope\nOver the top of their job you're looking over the top of the scope and then you just bring the scope to your eye and there it is but\nSo a deal is you don't try to look at the scope you look at the target and let the scope intercept your vision\nVery well but I I've been working on that [laughter] that's exactly what I'm Talking about yeah and I've tried I've taught people to do that and I said oh wow there yes\n[laughter] yes look at the drug and let the scope intercept your vision just bring it up to keep staring at the target don't try to look at the scope ... that's when it gets hard to ...\nIt's something that actually yeah but yeah to your point if you've ever variable scope keep an eye on low power pretty much all the time until you absolutely need the higher power\nExactly as always always always carry in the field on low power right so you can find a dark you know he's crank it up after you got to find a\nYou're all shooting last ... changes she'd like to thank you so much for probably ... back in later in the show then we're going we're open lines if you'd like to call him if he\nDoesn't come back when we talk about gun fighting and are you what's going\nBack [noise]\n... good morning just\nYour missions you you decide to accept it is the host the show that will bring them in the fire moms writing [noise] good luck to\nAnd you're going to\nBack to John Grisham don't you're listening to dump\nCongress will be our number is eight six six talk gun Tom talked gun if you'd like to be a part of the action here Wyoming's give me a call if you just discovered is or maybe you found me on Twitter by the way I Am at gun talk on Twitter and we are regularly getting anti ... and there it's very interesting to me how\nWe have forty thousand plus people there who are all well behaved and well spoken\nAnd polite and respectful and then when we get the gun banners the entire going to come in they're mean and nasty and rude and ugly and dropping F bombs and we just never see that from the gun owners I it makes\nMe wonder where it makes me wonder a lot of things will be beyond our time available to talk about that right now I mentioned uh that we are two days away from the anniversary of the nine eleven attacks on the United states of America it was a turning point in a lot of ways in for a lot of individuals who looked at that and said you know\n[noise] sweetie we may have to think about getting a gun and for a lot of people it was a\nChanging point it really was one of the people who have seen that in his work is Kim Campbell he is the director of operations to hit ... at the gun side academy in Arizona ... joined us right now he can how you doing\n[noise] Tom it's always good to be on their way out of your while\nWe're excellent appreciate and appreciate everything you guys do out there uh [noise] it's interesting I mean and I know what your extensive law enforcement background you may kind of sometimes wonder why would\nWhy would it take an event like nine eleven to have people realize that they need to take care of themselves but sometimes it does and sometimes people just kind of neat that wakeup call don't they\nDid that take that away and you know got to talk about that for many years on on being prepared whether it is famous metal prepared to lecture or going on into you need to be prepared for preventive or watch a live or even going back my old days as a boy scout you know be prepared\nNut unfortunately sometimes it takes a significant life event or they get people to realize\nThe world may not be applies and apply as a watch thought it was that there's a couple from Phoenix that come to mind there are many many many time over against students and they became ... you will after a good friend of theirs during a robbery was mark\nAnd a husband and wife are multiple guns I graduate their their regular competitors blocked matches both their sons are are ah regular clients of our students of ours and they also shoot competitor late but it took that\nSignificant a bat having a good friend murder 'em to really get them to wake up and that's been a twenty five thirty years ago\nAnd I know that happens on a regular basis where you get people that come to gun site which for those who don't know gun site is a training academy it's a shooting school it's a gun fighting school\nOr in pulled in Arizona where the north of Prescott a little bit or you can learn to shoot pistols rifles shotguns a and it teaches you an awful lot not exactly marksman ship although that's a part of it it's an awful lot of pieces of parts but all I Want to say is\nI Know that you get people who come there where\nThey have been assaulted or somebody they know who's been assaulted or somebody who's been murdered\nDo you see in those students a difference maybe a more of a sense of purpose perhaps than what the average student\nWithout fail a they tend to us to learn how to fight\nTo change change how they look at things because of the world as their world has changed so they can't air what that dedicated mindset and they leave with a big smile on their ... ad but daily with that empowerment that sense\nOf wellbeing that if something happens to me I my awareness to know seven principles a partial to pass my awareness should make me alert to that I may be able to simply walk across the street and avoid it\nOr if the why does why I can face it and deal with [noise]\nInteresting you say that because\nPeople who don't know people who have not been to gun site or one of the good trading schools out there and there are a number of them they think well you're going there because you really want to shoot somebody you want to learn how to shoot somebody\nAnd then people who come out of the first five day class it's been my experience that they will work harder than ever in their lives to avoid that situation because now they have a very real world appreciation for what it's all about [noise]\nWithout fail a that that\nThat Wednesday morning lecture on by that is probably the most important the lecture you get a gun site because it teaches you that color code in those seven principles of her quote and it makes you alert and aware so again instead of walking down the street like so many people are what their head in there I found\nI wasn't I wasn't going to say anything other than that what they're headed their iPhones\nCompletely unaware of what's going on around them and that criminal\nIs out there waiting sitting there thinking that's got to be an easy target when they come out of gun site they're headed up their alert or looking around and that criminal nothing else thanks you know all white there'll be an easy one\nFor our people see this bad guy or recognize something that is that that says that women's intuition that air stand on your neck and recognize that thing I I Need to go across the street or on weight and go out in the parking lot lighter\nGun side academy I mean it's a it's the happiest place on earth for me I got the gun side do you and that's like ... dot com telling her body hello for me what did you\nWell do you take care and come out saying we'll do it can gamble thanks so much yes it is amazing",
