R. P.\nYes [laughter] her ... when they were all there I mean are you all their yup All right sounds good but what bothers her Jennifer Marlowe the receptionist stuff like that at the W why why why in Kalamazoo\nOr there was a program manager what needs to be that way closed up ... let's wrap up by talking about some of your specialty beers before we get into our final tasting October fest is upon us you've got a special October fest beer a Mars and tell us about\nA lot of a breeze don't make loggers and we don't make a ton of logger but\nIncreasingly we're making more and more locker is a bigger craft brewery we've got the the tank the laboratory uh we got take space laboratory expertise\nAnd we love October fest season we love making this nice multi marching style beer it's designed to be drunk in quantity because that's what we do when we go to October fest we don't skimp on the mugs size and fill it up\nAnd or something that you can drink three for ... if if that's what you want to do\nI so that's limited availability and then next we've got these special double cream doubt that I'm looking at this thing Larry and uh I mean it looks like a chocolate bar ready to\nBe a consumer [noise]\nYou again one of our old old brands um we make a lot of different salads are coming up\nThe first Sunday in November we have on the Catholic calendar it's all saints day but we have all ... and I think our record is having twenty two different styles contempt um so uh we like ... a lot I Know special double ... along name a\nBed originally came out and maybe Nineteen eighty seven in a ... bottles little hundred eighty seven middle middle liter bottles are designed as a sweet out as a sort of a dessert beer a ended the night a sort of thing and um\nYou know just to a creamy rich sweet stout\nWell we're going to follow up with a stout that I have purchased\nIt's called the bells brewery Kalamazoo stopped but I'm going to kind of put a little slant on it the famous song I'm going to call the I've got a gallon Kalamazoo stop this is an American stout I've just boarded it looks like I poured a glass of his press a it is I mean like I'm a thorough looking cigar\n[noise] you know I I guess that would probably call this a medium stout um you know it's it's certainly fuller than than Guinness and and more alcohol\nAnd don't you know going back to ... literary stuff that we're talking about there's an old Kurt Vonnegut book and I can't remember which one it is where he talks about his grandfather being a brew master and how all brew masters have a secret ingredient\nAnd so back in the day we always used this Italian brewers licorice in ... in Kalamazoo stout\nAnd we you know if you don't know that it's there you probably wouldn't pick it out several years ago the government decided that we had to start putting that on the label so we do use a little bit of this growers licorice not really for flavor but more for ... feel their\nUm so this is our our ... year round stout our everyday uh drinking stout uh from but uh\nYou know learned is fabulous as we wrap it up it is a lot of flavor but I mean loads of dark chocolate\nSome nice coffee notes this is this Kalamazoo stout magnificent Larry want to thank you for joining us very fascinating really appreciate your time Larry bell the founder and CEO of ... brewery Larry next time you were down in Florida the cigar city we will do a special show with you\n[laughter] exactly that's exactly it in a nutshell it's it's really really the the origins of that John has it take um\nYou know take every rep and make a diagnostic like we say and and it's you know and it's no it's no more intuitive or nor oh and then to know more um thoughtful or or advanced than a than a basketball you know that you're you bring it to your home\nYou get a lot of reps in if you if you missed or not you know but who knows you know in a brick wall you know with the basketball doesn't work you don't get the feedback you know and you know and that's the scanner the premise of it and\nNot to mention other attributes just making the training convenient and do a lot of things we can't do on a range and and of course I felt federally didn't do this for the masses that build up for myself at just\nUnder half I wasn't going to ask you how did this come about in the first place\nYeah no it it it's a good question I let me take it that will take a step back in the second uh you know put what college football and like competitive Venus and such and those\nAre their formative years of life and everything and got misled and was life badly and turn went to law school and a lawyer\nDuring the ten years you but you can recover from that right I I'm recovering I Am recovering seven years been retired for yeah [laughter]\nUm you know the ... of course George Carlin them in and see what that was about but the moral or over the competitive shooter just love shooting 'em all disciplines I'm One of those weird oh that that love bull's eye and I started out those who have like a feat steel and us PSA I'm Still shooting\n... didn't have it in our area you know honestly\nBut anyways uh you know and I just looked at it like sports perspective I was never ... you know I've been fascinated with\nYour military and first bond or looking at the career options but I've never you know it's never never done that just just by way of uh you know football and lock all that stuff so but I just love shooting always loved guns very passionate but I I guess I looked at it from the sport science\nPerspective hey look you know I'm looking at the skill set of running around celebrating shooting speed inaccuracy just\nLook at some guy like Nick liquor doing this and later age right this is this something like you know new golfer know racket ball and this is this is this is the real deal you know I just couldn't believe I never was exposed to it before and I got to make in the short answer long and short or long but\nYou know I just had to build my own tool for high volume filth agnostic training and ironically nothing on the market was an air ... air soft has its place but you know the green got us\nRan out yeah this is so different now I'm looking here on the website and the next level training dot com you this comes in a glock in in Smith Wesson him and he Clunes if you will\nYou know these these are not you know these are not cheap these are actual school and I know a number of serious trainer all his or missiles and they use them for for training but also for practice give us the example of who uses it and I wanted to do with us or just all\nYeah you've added ... several different markets egg ... was put up like that between you know instructor and we see in her instructors but generally open enrollment instructors law enforcement of course I'm you know and and within that is really the theory is if you want to just just get get wrapped practical reps in a classroom\nUm where a lot of the manipulation skills as far and just entered Twain safety with the proficiency\nI mean yeah we can talk for control and grip grip establishment suicidal and do a lot of drills but when you get the big it in the hands you really see muzzle awareness trigger finger discipline and I've never had a class and correct someone on that somewhere along the way you know um but then from there I mean our our deal is really that high volume training like this\nLike I have several search around my house I just pick it up and get rats on calibrated rap so you've got the train side is the hardcore training and then more of a lifestyle of training where you can't really keep you're like well you can't keep your life are flying around so to speak\nYou know do you write but at the surface\nFocus is always there and sit at functional features of life are tools and so it's yeah it's\nDo you have ports are are are you know testimonials about how this helps and and how you could benefit from Sirte postal\nActually we're looking at a formal study right now I'm through you and I'll be like on that an actual like like the word you know a control group study I was just down there this summer I'm with Dr phil in on that on request of uh of one of the um you know it might it might have wanted it and I don't know quite what an agency\nSo anyways um but I mean the end it so yeah I mean get your questions that get yeah we have a litany of anecdotes of particularly than officer doesn't pass calls like this are they trained for the weekend they got to have training they got to have different training grip grip establishment\nAnd All right you got to know what you do need but then yeah yeah\nYeah exactly it's like Gina basketball you gotta have balance elbow I'd fall you know I mailed out right away\nYou know bad mechanics but um and then they come back and bathrooms you know strongly you know strong you know their their qualifications and and I don't just want to emphasize qualify ... to me that's like passing freshman English I mean that's like that's just a one on one thing right I mean\nI think there's something I Want to throw in your bike and I think it may be the part that you had mentioned that to me is the most important reason to get a search just all\nYeah that is the safety aspects\nI cannot tell you and you know the stories\nHow many negligent discharges have been made with the so called unloaded guns and people are products and shooting ... D be shooting a refrigerator shooting bookshelves shooting walls and sometimes unfortunately shooting other people with guns are these war Ron lauded\nYeah that well exactly and and even with a certain I'll throw this honor to stack on that that safety protocols hum you know we suggest I Would suggest\nTo you try to pick the best ballistic well the train but this or\nAdd that extra layer of caution Syrian case somehow in a parallel universe live fire gun which should not even be on your training or [laughter] you know go to the max life you know and it will say what practical tip here they're listening there and they make sure when your buddy comes\nYour guy or gal whoever your buddy come to your training area and they were carrying life or they don't go on auto pilot and draw it with you you know what I mean I\nSaid yes and and you know somebody comes in your training area they disarm and they leave it outside of the training and they're not in the room when you're doing this kind of training there's no lives ... there's no live gun there's nothing in the room with I'm done after school but I tell people working at the cost of ... pencils as I say they're not cheap but their actual tools are not toys\nAre looking at I look at the website like two thirty nine up to four hundred and thirty nine bucks right\nYeah I ... I mean there's discount codes and stuff I definitely would people courage to ... you know but it's about two hundred bucks for a performer model\nRead later Palmer flight and then dropped metal in Greenland or go to the pro model that you go on a scale\nGo check it out is next level tiny dot com or Mike Hughes thank you so much I appreciate you tell us the story\nTaken back and talk about some people don't believe you should have guns on the one that [noise]\n\n\nLooking for the\nWe're in a shootout or\nLarger database ranging on the Internet\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nHe is a school board buying interactions one location designed scale confusing\nWell it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about your price from two car it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including the success reason basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying for\nThis audio is for your review enough about Internet posting or distribution of other ... copy the equality origin on his property by our media Washington DC\nOptimal health introducing new Medicaid claims in Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that still family cared dot com will call a three three four six seven eight to five nine for Medicaid plans from optimal health\n[noise] hey folks it's Michael berry and if you want to be the envy of the neighborhood with a quality solid wood or forged iron door called southern front doors a family run business making America indoors right here in Houston\nTo eight one eight nine oh fifty eight sixty two eight one eight nine oh fifty eight sixty\nGreat doors at great prices better doors then you get at the big box stores and a whole lot cheaper 'cause they don't have to ship 'em anywhere southern front doors to eight one eight nine ... fifty eight six\nI Can't say enough good things about Cory diamonds and design whenever I'm shopping for my mom my wife and my sister even some of the guys in my family\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan that is right for\nCall a civilian let me get started\nGetting the perfect selection 'cause that's what she's there for by the way if they don't have what you need in stock\nBilly stagnant could custom designed something just for you gifts from Korea you're also nice when you're giving them to people who are mad at you it's hard to be mad at someone who just gave you a gift from Corey diamonds and design but hey don't take my word for it head on\nInto a quarry today or shop online at a C.

I see\nIt all blurs after a while so you you were given a talk there so defense distributed is the the fish distributed and goes on her two different efforts but you've been\nAssociated with the fish distributed for how long now\nI Wish I could create our arm and not liking the guy's going to have the on on on on the other guys and it was the primary project I\nDo ... and ... you had a press conference on Tuesday in Austin announcing that you are now the director of defense distributed and I gather that Cody Wilson has two longer with the company I'm not getting that right\nThat's correct a cutting resigned on a friday evening that the soil before that a last week on a on the board of directors cited man that was kind of it you know not\nEveryone and they concluded and it was thought that I could either quicker that we could look at the um the guys that guys are pretty interesting [laughter]\nThat her I said no no no you got this one you you you you've been basically ... director of operations for three years anyway so why not right\nRight right and our our ... our morality and Africa and Carter thought on that day to day running of the ... or ... ... ... it's a kind of ... and the team on nine eleven where comedy\nThe\nOf the things I kept getting questions for people who say well here's the effort going to continue and I ... I think inherited that is the whole what is the effort question which is this is really not\nI don't know I'm trying to figure out how to put it's not so much a getting guns out the door as it is an activism program is that fair\nAnd yeah I think I think that that's really quite strange if people whacking marketing company\nAnd dating myself okay the on the phone and I was the guy on and uh as as an activist Organisation wanting to its files to every every American has the has the right kind of access to you in a we have the right to publish or they\nAren't on it you know following a threat from the state economy and then and then today\nA long long legal battle now and we thought that we could have like at the end of the ... when we go to Sacramento State Department or you know on on the advice at the department of justice he said you know what these guys because otherwise you'll be infringing speech it'd be a celebrating the fact that my ...\nAnd so we don't we start like at the end of the tunnel but I mean I I don't want to come back on her\nAnyway and right there at the beginning of the contract when we entered into that eagle situation uh we we don't find it ... the machine scope CNC machine you finish out your ... frames\nAnd for that kind of a business kind of power and our other set on fire in times of the nation as a whole I think ... cheese expert on day that's what we're eagerly announced the uninsured that they sort of rights that maybe not\nAnd that that attacks right now not a tax on it and we kind of thing so that people push back against them and ensure that pick up on current kind of threat to someone in the ... as they want to take and taking out one light search like\nAnd that's really what was going on this ... for those who haven't quite grasp\nThe thing the whole ... D printing file thing at its core is defense distributed said we're going to put files on you know we're going to publish\nUh to enforce any of these state or federal law that violate our second\nAmendment and then the sheriff can prioritize those laws\nRight now is it that that's been done or is being done currently right now in Illinois right\nYeah in fact I Believe one third of the county there have already became a Second Amendment sanctuary\nOkay so what does that practice for a practical standpoint me as if the state passes a law that say this is a state law cannot county say okay that's great that's state law but we're going to ignore it I thought state law superseded county law\nWell it does supersede county law however there is a principal in the law called the anti common theory principal and this is why the groups who are promoting these illegal aliens sanctuary counties\nHave used in utilized do that in ... county governments do not have to enforce immigration laws\nAnd ... court did this I this is starting to get really tasty uh because I ... I see what you're doing you're basically using what the left is doing on the immigration sanctuary cities and say well if you can say we can ignore the law with this then we're going to say we can ignore the law on the gun laws\nAnd the difference in you're absolutely right and the difference is that immigration is not a right whereas\nThe second Amendment rights designated in the constitution\nHey we're going to run out of time Rob but if people want to know more about this do you have a website or place they can go\nYes it's called the sanctuary ordinance dot com sanctuary ordinance dot com all one word\nSanctuary ordinance dot com fascinating it was started in ... I think it started Illinois and now it's over in Oregon\nBasically in places where they have these uh super majorities in I could see it happening in California as well where's the legislatures see out of control and doesn't listen to the people the people say well you know what was going to take control at least on the local level is you can do this fascinating\nWell what do you think it's a good idea to ban\nIs\nDamn three point eight compact Springfield farmers used to\n[noise]\nListeners in Washington state initiative sixteen thirty nine years on the ballot [noise]\nIt must be defeated [noise] if you have relatives family friends in Washington state be sure that they understand that probably what they're they're probably be seeing a lot of ads about that now and\nProbably most of them are just total lies sixteen thirty nine I Would make even your squirrel rifle semi automatic rifle a quote unquote assault weapons it has a whole lot of other really horrible features to it\nAnd look here's the reality is going to be very difficult to seat that it's hard to fight millions of dollars and add daughters of\nAdvice we don't have the money we just don't have the money um\nBut we can share the information and that's where you come in if you if you're in Washington state tell everybody you know tell them what's really going on and tell them to ignore these ads that they're seeing it actually did the research to find out what it's about actually get the bill and read it themselves it's initiative sixteen thirty nine alright [noise]\nUh would come back after this break I'll talk a little bit about my take on what's going on with the Dems right now the crafts and their effort [noise] no we are sturdy if you just a little more than thirty days out of this midterm election\nThey're already saying that they if they win control of the house they're going to\nGet grew after Trump's tax returns they want to impeach him they went through all this other stuff\nIt's really an important election and up until this past week I'm not sure people on the rights were really energized I think perhaps that his change we'll talk about that but I talked to add on line three out of Medford, Oregon hello at your own gun talk\nTom I was kinda curious on these three they printed guns how many rounds can you fire and something like that there's a single shot\nA right now I think the designs are for a single shot a right now three D printing is playing mirror really some type of plastic material but there are three D printing systems that will print metal\nOr the other thing is it's not just three D printing got understand this fine is really about the publication of files and can the government say you can't publish something it's really more I think it's more of a First Amendment issue them second because the government is saying you can't print\nYou can't publish on the Internet these blueprints you cannot publish on the Internet these are designed files when it's perfectly legal to make your own gun and with this goes on her system if these guys have you could make a Nineteen eleven you can make and they are Fifteen out of metal\nOr with the system right there on your kitchen counter and that is absolutely legal it the weird part is it's legal to make the gun but they want you for him but the distribution of the files that's weird don't you think yeah\nI I agree uh you know it is a matter of information to the public and then we have basically the ship guns they\nThey pay it back to pick up\nA piece of recording it shut she'll it yeah\nI Would have been making\nOr there are people I mean I Know people who own in late in the basement fairly machine away and you can sit there and make an absolutely honest to God real very fine firearm with that sets legal as well\nYeah and I wonder about machine guns it legal to make a machine that\nIt is if you were to license it and get the approval of the government\nIs going to be another challenge but that's you know the thing is making it an adult you can't sell them ... you have to get the permission I don't think they're going to get the approval to make but you actually could could prove to make it you couldn't sell you're exactly right so you could do that and that's the other things you can make your own\nGuns at home but you can't make them at home and sell them but it's perfectly legal to make your own firearms and has been\nThat's how long it's been legal stuff was that people don't get the\nWhat was your take on your any somebody ... let's go there because it's there's a really big factor in the second amendment gun rights\nHave six talk I'll give you my [noise]\n[noise]\nAre you looking for\nNational Shooting Sports turns out jewelry shop and makes people nervous did

people go yeah yeah yeah but\nNo no there's no yeah but this is the same party this is why I ever arrived at the position where I Am\nFor the rest of my life I Will\nWhat was the Democratic party there is no such thing as well but I'm going to vote for somebody because that's a good person regardless of party because we're voting for a Democrat now means supporting\nThe scorched earth policy I must say something and I hope you will stay with the long enough to understand what I'm Talking about they're willing to do everything and anything including kill people\nTo get their agenda what did I just say you heard me they are willing to do anything up to and including killing people to advance their political agenda case in point\n[noise] Randy Weaver suspected of not paying two hundred dollar tax but it was a gun tax as a result they killed his wife to kill the son\nThat Waco Seventy three people were shot burned to death because supposedly they didn't pay a two hundred dollar firearms tax\nBut let's go further than that with the Obama administration to fast and furious program was instituted in created and implemented\nAs a way to push gun control in this country they the thinking was and they said we need something we can point to so that we can get more gun control laws passed we can't get past the Obama administration of hours in the White House but the Republicans control Congress\nHe said what we need is to be able to point to American Guns being used in Mexico in crime and then we can say we do something here to save the people in Mexico from crime with guns\nThey were told what if you do this gun running program if you\nMake sure that semi automatic firearms are sold illegally and taken into Mexico by the thousands people will die including possibly problem the American law enforcement officer send the response was well if you're going to make it out and let you have to break a few eggs in other words yeah\nWe know people are gonna die but at least for gun control program put\nForward that's the Democratic party will kill you if ... is our agenda were okay with that [noise]\nI don't know why it took me this long to get there 'cause a lot

amendment\nThat's it that's what's going on they were steak and that is what is that the heart of this whole thing they know how he's going to ruin the second amendment that nobody's going to support

about\nThe upcoming mid term elections and how important they are and to help us get a grasp on that and actually to give you some tools that you can use because sometimes you think you know not really up on all of that joining us right now is mark Olivier from the national Shooting Sports foundation hey mark welcome\nTom thanks for having me appreciate you get into some time to talk about how these lectures are to gun owners\nAbsolutely because you know and I talked to people say yeah you know I really need to do that but I'm not sure where to vote or I'm not sure where my candidate is on this primary shooter and that's kind of ... the whole gun vote things about isn't it\nIt is so and it's a staff or several years ago last dark gun vote a program so they go to ... or it will take you to a Web page where you can type in you know where you live and it will tell you your candidates are and where they stand on gun issues and and just like it was a two years ago in the presidential election\nThis mid term elections going to be crucial as to as to what stands for rice you know who's going to be protecting our rights\nAnd what we can expect out of the next couple of years so when it comes to the fires policy in America\nIt's interesting he said 'cause it's fires policy I'm not sure people say well you I Know yeah we want to win and I want to stop and say well let me explain to you what this means because right now the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the White House\nWhen the Democrats get control of the house for instance they can control what bills are introduced they can control what bills are voted on if the Democrats control the Senate of course they get control of the confirmation process on Supreme Court justice as we've just seen that battle there\nAnd of course the Democrats also announced that if you control the house they're going to try to impeach a President Trump and also they're going to try to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh chief justice now will scream court\nThey can only do those things if they are in the majority of each else am I right\nAbsolutely right and that's how I Am so when we have control of both the house and Senate\nAre those are the most politicians from our elected leaders who are listening to their gun owners who are voting for them then they're going to make sure that these are these pointless investigations these pointless hearings\nOn our body down to Congress in getting a ... a policy issues pushed forward in pushing back the ones that are truly got to be detrimental to us on our ability to exercise our Second Amendment rights\nYou know and are just so people understand what we're talking about we're talking about the everybody says well we need a national reciprocity\nYou're not going to get that with Democrats in control of the house on the Senate you know we want a the hearing Protection Act you're not going to get that with the Democrat Party in charge of the house and Senate it's not going to happen to physically\nLogically impossible to get those but what you are going to get a lot of efforts at more restrictive gun control laws which means stripping away or infringing on your rights\nYou're you're absolutely right of the time so I looked at it a national character ... been introduced in the last Congress\nBut still pending out there the hearing Protection Act as as a builder still pending out there uh and and the joy so overwhelming support but because of the difficulty in the math in the Senate because it only takes one senator filibuster hold those bills up\nWe haven't been able to those two issues for which we know are crucial issues too far in America today they want to see these things pass they want to see them for to be able to exercise their rights without any kind of impediment so\nEven when we're talking about having control these houses are still poor that we have a majority to be able to do this we need ... senators to filibuster Cruz held a news this is true in right now we have a razor thin margin sent so we really need to make sure that\nThey are voters out there are educated as to where they're kind of stand they know where the issues are and they can go find that at a at gun poked out of work\nYou know market occurs to me also one of the things or incest F works on a lot of things that people don't know about their important but they're kind of\nHidden not secret exactly but they're just not on the radar things like this would be important in the upcoming election things like the efforts to use the EPA to try to be an entire classifications of ammunition because they contain let\nShore yeah it it's not just at the federal level wishing that the state level as well so\nOur folks that are working wash it share meeting with their legislators every day and age with both the house and the Senate\nThey're both eat it with a Republican or Democrat and they're they're trying to make sure they understand what the what the unintended consequences of these bills could be so they start to band lead ammunition traditionally mission and they say you can't use that for hunting it\nEverywhere you know it's like hey I think it was like wow okay this is a great so I'm Glad I'm Glad we we came by their to sing some\nKaraoke because uh it reminded me that you know I needed to have you on the show so that was that's really great ness um so what else is uh going on and what else what else do you are going on\nI'm just promoting a former church new record 'em that we have a that just came out okay worship for generations and I have a new project coming out at the beginning of the year and I've been working out for\nA long time so hopefully everything I'm guessing Qunu producers dead or we're including that's in the LA area of him at the boom that I just met so we we got some things working\nSo fall brick church worship for all generations is the name of the of the CD\n[noise] and then my out where do you need to go for you I Want to get that ... some odd tunes right now are cool on all digital digital distribution attribution\nOkay cool and then my my record a pie Vincent ... is going to be called venting\nAnd that ... the team yeah OK venting about ... ... yeah it is [laughter] I got to be coming at the at the top of the year yeah I mean it's just so record okay so it's not going to be my normal John or a gospel around our Christian but I Believe that yet\nAnd once you say the law say y'all get out of Philly yeah exactly ...\nAnd one of my uh one of my good friends with the church she says you know when you when you uh except crisis your saver uh that's him sitting hook you don't like a fish on the line you could run\nYou'll give his mind and run and eventually is going to really you know eventually it's going to really and so\nYou know marketers want to cry so that says forever writing as what we say in the liturgy and the Episcopal Church so and I absolutely believe that too and uh I Would rather go to church chew on day yeah well you know [laughter] if you know gospel praising worship was on one of the spectrum we're kind of on the\nYou know we try we try a little bit but we're doing All right you know and requires about\nA dozen people and and we do we do our thing so\nYeah it's just that they are like you know like somebody huh you'd be

would you least write a check\nWould you show up and lots of people are doing it at least in part look at the crowd at the Trump rallies that's a commitment yeah go stand in line for hours to get to

where you can find good deals on line and you can find us real simple\nAgain eight six six talk gun we're talking about\nThe upcoming midterm elections and how important they are and to help us get a grasp on that and actually to give you some tools that you can use because sometimes you think I'm not really up on all of that joining us right now is mark ... Olivier from the national Shooting Sports foundation hey mark welcome\nTom thanks for having me appreciate your getting up sometimes talk or these lectures are to gun owners\n'cause you know and I talked to people I said yeah you know I really need to do that but I'm not sure where\nA voter I'm not sure where my candidate is on this ... not sure well that's kind of what the whole gun vote things about isn't it\nIt is so and it says south or several years ago ... vote a program so they go to ... dot org it will take you to a Web page where you can type in you know where you live and it will tell you your candidates are and where they stand on gun issues and and just like it was a two years ago in the presidential election\nThis mid term elections going to be crucial as to as to what stands for rice you know who's going to be protecting our rights and what we can expect out of the next couple of years so when it comes to the fires policy in America\nIt's interesting you said 'cause it's fires policy I'm not sure people say well you I Know yeah we want to win\nAnd I want to stop and say well let me explain to you what this means because right now the Republicans control the house and the Senate and the White House\nWhen the Democrats get control of the house for instance they can control what bills are introduced they can control what bills are voted on if the Democrats control the Senate of course they get control of the confirmation process on Supreme Court justice as we've just seen that battle there\nAnd of course the Democrats also announced that if they get control the house they're going to try to impeach a President Trump and also they're going to try to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh chief justice now Supreme Court\nThey can only do those things if they are in the majority of each else am I right\nYou're absolutely right and that's how I Am so what we have control of both the house and Senate\nFrom those of us were most politicians from our elected leaders who are you know listening to their gun owners are voting for them then they're going to make sure that these these pointless investigations these pointless hearings\nOn our body down to Congress in getting important a policy issues pushed forward in pushing back the ones that are truly going to be detrimental to us on our ability to exercise our ...\nYou know and are just so people understand what we're talking about we're talking about the everybody says well we need a national reciprocity you're not going to get that\nWith Democrats in control of the house on the Senate you know we want a the hearing Protection Act you're not going to get that with the Democratic party in charge of the house and Senate it's not going to have to physically\nLogically impossible to get those but what you are going to get a lot of efforts at more restrictive gun control laws which means stripping away or infringing on your rights\nYou're you're absolutely right and the time so I looked at the national character that's possibly act has been introduced in the last Congress\nBut still pending out there the hearing Protection Act as as a builder still pending out there are a joy so overwhelming support but because of the difficulty and the math in the Senate because it only takes one senator filibuster hold those bills up\nWe haven't been able to those two issues for which we know are crucial issues too far in America today they want to see these things that they want to see them for it to the altar exercise their rights without any kind of impediment so\nEven when we're talking about having control these houses are still poor that we have a majority to be able to do this we need sixty senators to filibuster proof to be able to move since this is true in right now we have a razor thin margin ... so we really need to make sure that\nThey are voters out there are educated as to where the Kennedys stamp they know where the issues are and they can go find that at a at gun poked out of work\nYou know market occurs to me also one of the things or incest F works on a lot of things that people don't know about their important but they're kind of\nHidden not secret exactly but they're just not on the radar things like and this would be important or in the upcoming election things like the efforts to use the EPA to try to be an entire classifications of ammunition because that contain lead\nShore yeah it it's not just at the federal level wishing that the state level as well so\nOur folks that are working washed issue or what their legislators every day and meeting with both the house and the Senate their\nBoat anyway but Republican Democrat then they're they're trying to make sure they understand what the what the unintended consequences of these bills could be so they start to ban led mission traditionally ... and they say you can't use that for hunting and\nThey're going to be some careful\nHere um interesting caliber options they're going to be some upgrades in guns that you already know and like\nAnd they're going to be even better I'm I'm trying to be careful here because we don't we're spill the beans we we get a chance to play with a lot of these these guys have the time I'm One of them I really got huge\nWe had a ball with a contract some video I think you're just going to enjoy the heck out of the question is Hi this is kind of the question\nDo you need a new gun\nDo any of us do any of us really need a new gun thank goodness need is really not a factor for us um yeah I've got nine to not have forty five and that forties\nCan be ... well ... what do you need another sent me out of four I'll fortunately I don't think I absolutely need want\nBut if you're really into it it's not difficult at all to find a gap an opening however\nInfant testimony ... small it might be oh well that would fit right between this and that and I don't have anything that fits this gap that I have just cruise [laughter] yeah I Know and look we we have to self enable\nWhenever we can't find a buddy a friend who will help us in April All right so that's something we have to think I'm looking at a some news reports here one of the alerts that I have set up is for home invasions\nAnd I'm looking at one out of Dallas [noise] man knocks on the door women up to the door men and women Russia's in and they do horrible things to this
