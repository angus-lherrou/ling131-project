action here Wyoming's give me a call if you just discovered is or maybe you found me on Twitter by the way I Am at gun talk on Twitter and we are regularly getting anti ... and there it's very interesting to me how\nWe have forty thousand plus people there who are all well behaved and well spoken\nAnd polite and respectful and then when we get the gun banners that are going to come in they're mean and nasty and rude and ugly and dropping F bombs and we just never see that from the gun owners I it makes\nMe wonder where it makes me wonder a lot of things will be beyond our time available to talk about that right now I mentioned uh that we are two days away from the anniversary of the nine eleven attacks on the United states of America it was a turning point in a lot of ways and for a lot of individuals who looked at that and said you know\n[noise] [noise] it's really we may have to think about getting a gun and for a lot of people it was a\nChanging point it really was one of the people who is seeing that in his work is Ken Campbell he is the director of operations to hit ... out of the gunfight academy and Arizona can join just right now and how you doing\n[noise] Tom it's always good to be on their way up while\nWe're excellent appreciate and appreciate everything you guys do out there uh it's interesting I mean and I know what your extensive law enforcement background you may kind of sometimes wonder why would\nWhy would it take into an event like nine eleven to have people realize that they need to take care of themselves but sometimes it does and sometimes people just kind of need that wakeup call darker\nDid that take that away you know got Cooper talked about that for many years on on being prepared whether it's is famous Mel preparedness lecture or going on and to you need to be prepared for better or watch a live or even going back my old days as a boy scout you know be prepared\nNut unfortunately sometimes it they they significant light that they get people to realize\nThe world may not be applies in a place as I watch thought it was that there's a couple from Phoenix that come to mind there are many many many time over gun site students and they became gun people if you will after a good friend of theirs during a robbery was mark\nAnd this has been and why are multiple guns I graduate their their regular competitors matches both their sons are our regular clients of our students of ours and they also shoot competitively but it took\nSignificant event having a good friend murdered 'em to really get them to wake up and that's been twenty five thirty years ago\nAnd I know that happens on a regular basis where you get people that come to gun site which for those who don't know gun site is a training academy it's a shooting school it's a gun fighting school\nOr in pulled in Arizona where the north of Prescott a little bit or you can learn to shoot pistols rifles shotguns a it teaches you an awful lot not exactly merchant ship although that's a part of it it's an awful lot of pieces of parts but all I Want to say is\nI Know that you get people who come there where\nThey have been assaulted or somebody they know who's been assaulted or somebody who's been murdered\nDo you see in those students a difference or maybe a more of a sense of purpose perhaps than with the average student\nWithout fail they come to us to learn how to fight to change change how they look at things because of the world their world is changing so they come here with that dedicated mindset\nAnd they leave with a big smile on their ... but they leave with that empowerment that sense\nOf wellbeing that if something happens to me I my awareness to know seven principles a personal defense my awareness should make me alert to that I may be able to simply walk across the street and a boy that\nOr if the why does why I can face it it'd be\nInteresting you say that because\nPeople who don't know people have not been to gun site or one of the good trading schools out there and there are a number of them they think well you're going there because you really want to shoot somebody you want to learn how to shoot somebody and then people who come out of the first five day class it's been my experience that\nThey will work harder than ever in their lives to avoid that situation because now they have a very real world appreciation for what it's all about [noise]\nWithout fail a that that\nThat Wednesday morning lecture on by that is probably the most important lecture you get a gun site because it teaches you that color code in those seven principles of her quote and it makes you alert nowhere so again instead of walking down the street like so many people are with their head in there I followed\nWhat I went and got to say anything other than what their head in their iPhone\nCompletely unaware of what's going on around them and that criminal\nIs out there waiting sitting there thinking that's got to be an easy target when they come out of gun site they're headed up their alert or looking around and that criminal nothing else thanks you know all white there'll be an easy one\nFor our people see this bad guy or recognize something that is that that says that women's intuition that air stand your they recognize that I think I Need to go across the street or on weight and go out in our in our later\nAnd you got to be you got to trust that an when something doesn't feel right pay even more apt to see what that is until you got a reason to stand down or you've got a reason for that to relax um\nOr you or the ... gone way because you moved out of that environment you got I got that feeling\nI put it in another way I tell people sick hope will get you killed\nSo what do you mean when you're walking down the street you see I sure hope those guys aren't as bad I Hope over the coming over here I sure hope they don't mean to hurt me oh I'm going across the street they cross the street kinda sure hope that you know at a certain point and I would say early on\nYou have to just say okay that as you say that doesn't feel right now I'm going to start taking action immediately and a lot of times the actually take is simply to remove yourself from the situation\nAnd it never becomes an attack or a life threatening situation at all but ... it's because you had the right around\n... absolutely ... and when when that this miscreants sees that you've seen them and you're giving them some attention again I've got to think they're going to thank you know there's another one white [noise]\n... yeah ... ... they wait for the er at the easier praise that comes along\nCan or for the the five day or two fifty class at gun site I Know you guys running a whole bunch of them now it's one that can take you and I want to tell people you don't have to be gunfire to go there you can be you could actually have never fired a gun and start with that class can't you\nAsk slowly you come with a brand new got it a box or or rent one from us and I'm not saying that to make some rental income I'm saying that if if you don't know what kind of guys back for you if you can rent one from us by the end of the week he'll be an informed consumer that way you can go on a daily out and you can find\nThat gun you're looking for and get that back price as an informed consumer\nSo you come here with a gun in a box and and will will make you run faster and jump higher and you come away stronger better shooter certainly say and a\nAnd B ... be empowered and ... and in a comfort zone and we're seeing more and more folks like that that never would have been people because they're recognizing the world a little more dangerous like\nYeah and and probably you're getting closer to even split of women these days I Would guess\nOh a women are a large percentage of what do we do some ... some ladies only classes here but it's only because some women don't want to learn what man and honestly man you may want to plug your ears hair the women are better students than than we are because we got ... they don't\nYes exactly very often they start off behind and by the third day they passed up demand for only one reason they're listening Ken I got around here I appreciate everything you guys do\nGun site academy I mean it's a it's the happiest place on earth for me I got a gun side G. U. S. I. T. E. dot com tell her about hello Kwame what'd you\nWell do you take care and come out saying we'll do it can gamble thanks so much yes it is amazing somebody who's actually listen you can actually use them out she said oh yeah but you know my\nGreat as one must you're not listening to structure why did you see all that money was eight six six talks John I'm Tom Gresham looking for your range abortions [noise]\n\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options you can find you the loan them right\nCall it today in orange\n[noise]\nDid\nYou watch any of the series the judge Kavanaugh here he's he's obviously nominee for three court [noise] there was some highlights\nIn some ... some use left you scratching your head highlight for me was uh been fast center from the state of Nebraska he gave a Fifteen minute talk that should be required viewing you could go on a YouTube watch it gets you to pop up ... S. A. S. S. C. been fast\nIt's basically the schoolhouse rock version of American civics and then there's the ... no\nThe flip side Camilla Harris from California was just an arrogant bully\nAnd own ... threatening insinuating snide tricky condescending rude Odessa route again good um and then we have central Feinstein holy moly\nAnd she's talking to the judge about his ruling in a case in D.C where he courted the Heller decision used that as a precedent and she said well you said that uh assault weapons she keeps using the term assault weapons semi automatic rifles cannot be regulated because they're coming to use what you mean by that\nYou say well the Heller decision um Justice Scalia wrote that guns and common use or cannot be a ... and ... her she's well what'd you base it on your research and say well you know there are\nMillions as he said quote millions and millions and millions of semi automatic rifles owned by America she civil that's owned but assault weapons are not uncommon use people don't actually use them for anything other than school shootings\nAnd at this point I Know your head starting to explode cause you thinking\nWhat do you think ten million a are Fifteen just start off one category sub category of semi automatic rifles where do you think are used to ... why do people own them where they shoot them they go to the range they teach marksman ship they do competition with them\nThey hunt ... it'll be ... oh you know my hunch with those yes hundreds of thousands if not perhaps even knows maybe millions of people use air fifteens for hunting why because it's a really good rifle design it's just a rifle\nIt works the same just get this straight it works the same way as president Teddy Roosevelt semi automatic rifle did you pull the trigger wants it goes bang once but to Dianne Feinstein she says those are not in common use\nOf course what she's saying and she said you know I authored by all office authored the assault weapons ban\nIt Nineteen Ninety three ... in chief of course it was in effect for ten years and you know I think it worked very well taken worked very well\nCrime did not go down what are you talking about\nWhat worked very well because it was a full gun ban and she likes any kind of gun ban I mean and she went on sixty minutes for those who don't remember\nAnd she said I didn't have the votes where they could have gotten the votes I would've confiscated them all not just banned the sale of them not just regulate them picked her court was pick them all up Mr and Mrs America turned them all in\nSo she has a gun control a skater gun banner and then she's sitting there trying to berate judge Kavanaugh when he says will these guns are uncommon usually she's grown they're not income so maybe a lot of them to their own but people don't actually use ... really so here's my question to you\n[noise] do you have and look I Know what let's start the ball rolling we can do it right now do you have and they are Fifteen do you have a semi automatic rifle of any type\nAnd what do you use it for let's just start but some of those on the record right now this will be a really good time call me an eight six six talk on or Tom talked gun and just tell me what kind of semi automatic rifle\nUp dramatically and it's all about understanding how to be able to get the job done quicker these days for sure\nWell to that point taught one of the things that you do I mean I Know most of you guys know you guys for a long time\nYou spend if not every waking minute pretty close to every waking minute trying to figure out\nHow can I Do this better and it may be is there a way to shave a few thousands off with a reload or a drawl or maneuver or even as as esoteric to us but not to you is is there a way for me to use my eyes differently as they move from target to target a bright\nYes it is in but you know a lot is just an individual um that you have to work with as an instructor so I good instructor will be able to understand\nAnd do I have the individual issues have no problem with target acquisition is it a ... type of thing but the holster as a learning how to be able to move correctly it to get into position\nAnd so good and sharp and we'll be able to pick up on that\nI'm like I'm at the range now I mean I'm sitting here I just finished popping out ... rounds and and I'm here trying to figure out how to shave all more time on more difficult targets and so for me it's like trying to\nTake an individual and find their weaknesses that can create the speed an accuracy they need um within within the unit or a team that their work and so I really want to be able to make that guy the best he can be\nYou're always going to have strengths you're all they can have weaknesses I Want to find those weak point you make that got stronger and faster more accurate\nCan the average person who is really more interested in I Want self protection concealed carry home defense is there a value to that man or woman in getting involved in competition shooting\nAbsolutely I mean I you know it's a shame that we only have a very small amount of\nCompetitive shares it ... it will come from law enforcement military she was in in the civilian world\nOf course there's more and more coming into the action Shooting Sports every single day whether it be us PSA or id PA are three gone or even procedure rifle I'm you if you want to become a better shot and be able to use\nThose skills for self protection or whether it be you're about to be home loans straight it if absolutely amazing when I take somebody off the street who wants to get in a competition get them in a four year\nYour weapons manipulation door skills to be able to shoot beaten accuracy\nIs it's unbelievable how fast or individual can grow in that area\n[noise] I I Know that you know and you're obviously a hell of a shooter they're doing it forever or you have great skills and at the same

guns we're we've got to get it fixed up we've got to do this guy do that\n[noise] just how much has changed over that period of time in terms of what's available these days right out of the box\nOr a ... you know it is absolutely amazed when I was a pretty much wander you know you know to the newcomers that the game back in the early eighties when I came out and started shooting and I got name Rob late lunch or a dollar you're left with no end Jared ... in um so we all kind of started\nI kind of came in a few years after they did but it was an innovation that keen eye\nIt'd be shooting world and he actually shooting world that took guns to a completely new level everything from\nA better sites to better barrels to better a bullet step better powder accuracy better techniques stores power cheers belts I wear a hearing protection I mean we can't just go right down the line just branch off in forty directions and those areas and be\nIndia if we jump forward Thirty Years' look at it I could put my finger print on probably fifty sixty Seventy ... items that I had bomb worked on over the years with the companies I work with a ... story made and\nIt really is and you compared to shooting is the NASCAR or guns is it's we're products get tested you find out what works what doesn't you think are you in the filters down and now you whatever you guys have worked on a year or two or five years later we're able to buy it in the stores\nActually take a look at the ... you know the black gun market the uh you know the typical AOL or is that we that you used to own back in the seventies and eighties and\nEven in the early nineties oh you know they were pretty much ... stock you know I'm a Vietnam Era guns I mean right now if you just look the word\n... three gone his started Fifteen Years ago to look where you can buy a gun now with hand guards and better triggers and stock should've bedroom barrels that are now that guns were only good for after two hundred yards away now was shooting them up\nTo six seven eight hundred yards away it's truly amazing what we have done and in that area from the competitive shooting ... side for sure\nYou know another thing that's happened I'm just thinking about that as you're talking Todd is that uh people won't put up with less than that any more than ... they're not satisfied with what we had Fifteen Twenty years ago anymore\nThat is right in ... you know in in in the hard thing for me is not working in the gun industry as long as I have now for twenty eight years [noise] ah\nI tell you know talking about policies are geared to like you you got to push you got to find something else better and then the next company and you got to find the next trick that we can put on the market that makes that\nProduct so much more inferior over you know another company and so I'm always struggling to um work would you know all the guns Smith who are older competitive guys that were you know we're brainstorming off in
