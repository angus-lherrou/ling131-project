Petersburg with Jeff color the owner and proprietor master brewer counter Meyer now recapping here\nThey're eight actually nine steps to creating beer first is your ingredients by the way all these alerts to guard a dot com the second is matching of the grains keeping grains in hot water for an hour between a hundred and forty due to a hundred and fifty nine degrees ... wrenching the sugar out of the grains creating the ward boiling for about an hour\nNumber five is adding the hops is where we left off and counter you just gave me and Jeff you just gave me a half a glass here\nOf hops and these are what ... ... this popular ... very okay especially among the idea is that what that was one that sold out because everyone wanted it last year I'm getting notes the pine ... floral little ... very credible now these kind of like little pellets is that how they're grown or they've created in ... they're grown\nIn these little cones but pellets are easier to transport because an ounce of of a holy hops can actually go out a lot quicker and they they it's about you know a lot larger so this they they just pulverized them and put them through an extra or that that puts them in the ... gotcha so this is an assistant and even in about them all to\nThis is what gives the beer a lot of flavor a lot of the various tasting notes whether it's real happy those bitterness units or the other case that you would get on the ballot right now we go to showing show the beers boiled for just about an hour and you're adding hops throughout your adding the hops okay then you go to showing\nNow as I say about earlier or with the hops that when you add them changes whether you're going to get better instrument aroma from it or a flavor from it so if it takes you an hour or two hours to chill down all those ... hops you put in have been in hot water for long enough where they become bettering hops so the quicker you can chill it\nThe more you can retain the flavors that you want also the less chance for infection you have ... and\nBelow eighty degrees mhm what's the rough temperature each other I usually go for about Seventy five Seventy five ... ... if you'd Stu how you're gonna kill the east it's too cold is just gonna keep east asleep you got to your friends you you will you want to make the environment for them really uh I'm\nHappy well incomes to beer beast is your used as your friend not ... not however are filled the next thing is pitching the east of life here\nThis is where it becomes clear ... well yeah that a living thing I mean east is is is a beautiful thing that you can make alcohol you can make CEO to show me it's just this is where the the life comes to come and they're different types of east there are there's different\nDifferent strain yes range from different regions and they have different quality you know qualities each each one might produce same with water water water in the east or or um you know related to the regions that come from [noise] okay so then you pitch the east and how long is the only time after you've\nCool to down sanitation is a very key okay you don't want to infections of other bacteria is wild nice if we can get really bad off flavors so once you show that you've sanitize everything that's going to touch your beer at this point it's still considered war until east is added but\nSanitation is absolutely key okay so your pitch the east then what happens stepping you close it in for for ... for mentor and you add an air lock or a year you should have been drinking the whole sort of a threat\nFor you make it so I think you get into it so this law to basically or an airline which just lets the CEO to the east is creating come out but nothing coming\nOkay so fermentation how long\nAbout a month a month so basically you you when you pitch the ... you then are you're putting the east into a new container into the ferment ended up from mentor gotcha so you take the work world wars\nThat has the hops you show at them and you put it into the for mentor along with the used for thirty days now difference between a logger and a nail involves the field\nBack temperature temperature temperature um loggers east typically ferment around fifty five degrees in alleys typically from EPA tweens sixty two to Seventy two degrees and one of the top fermenting and the other's bottom from it for the most probably for the most\nPart okay gotcha so thirty days has now gone by now I'm looking here you've got beer ales sixty two to Seventy two degrees two to three weeks log or fifty five sixty degrees two to three weeks\nNow determined logger actually log during is aging and cold temperature ... a logger you'd ferment at fifty five fifty fifty seven for\nTwo or three weeks and then you would log or it for up to three months and that's actually the process of law governing is about thirty five degrees and you maintain that for for two or three months not actually clear to flavor it clears the beer out for clarity\nSo loggers are longer ales about thirty days absolutely ... require a lot more patience to correct so thirty days have gone by with your ... your ... now what do you do comes out of the perimeter\nSo you put it into another container that's also sterilized a you as a set amount of sugar and then you can read what now a set amount of sugar a landing on how much carbon nation you want to say this is this part of the east so alive okay so you put it another bucket you add sugar\nAnd then you put it into each bottle and Catholic okay and what that sugar to the east will eat that sugar inside the bottle and creating a C. O. two okay and it'll naturally Cartwright carbonate inside of the bottom [noise] All right and then you wait about two weeks if even a week and a half and putting your fridge and you enjoy your nice tasty beverage\nFantastic and as we\nDiscussed in our number one during our life ... ceremony\nWe actually sampled some of your beers which were absolutely fantastic now somebody wants to buy a whole ruined get we've learned all eight nine steps science are bringing home brewing I'm looking here and we'll take a picture of this will actually we did take a factual but the ... dot com\nThat's an entire kit that you need everything how much on two hundred to ...\nBasically revised or throw out the history of the gun in America which was a an individual right from the beginning reason they didn't talk about it all the time was because it was like such such as a non starter it was like breathing the air or something like you know are going to church you know people\nOn them and had them and no one really question that right on so probably the Nineteen thirties\nAnd it's interesting you put it that way because you're right way back the idea of you have a gun you have a gun for self protection for providing food for protecting your family that was trying to explain that to someone would be like saying we're let me explain to you that we need to breathe\nNearby would go ... well yeah why are we even talking about\nI mean we wouldn't even and people on the sort of outskirts of society for instance I mean they wouldn't be able to survive without guns who would have been impossible for them and [noise]\nUm you know I mean I you know the idea that that some government person would calmer the state would come and say you have to ask for permission to defend yourself\nIs the antithesis of what the whole constitution is about in many ways I think how people treat the second amendment tells you a lot about how they think about freedom in general and uh that's why it's so important and that's why it's the first freedom\nWhat'd you say that I like that where the guy how people treat the second amendment tells you what they think about freedom and I find in the discussions we have a lot of people in America\nPut it in my armchair psychologist role here I think maybe they know that they are not protecting themselves in their family they're not doing everything they should do and\nThe fact that I Am and others are stands in stark evidence in contrast to what they're doing and if they can make sure that we're not taking care of ourselves than they do have to feel bad about not taking care of themselves and their family is that is that going too far\nI think that that's that's definitely the case with some people I think that's definitely part of it I think the other part of it is that a lot of those people that you're mentioning\nAnd others um view the government very differently as they view it as a protector all the time and they don't want you to rely on yourself because the more you rely on the state the more important the state is and that's what they want it to be in your life\nIt's already too important in my estimation already too big and too invasive but they want to be more of that and I think guns are one of the things that are very tangible thing that it can take away from me or it may not allow you to have it's something that if he was unsafe\nUm and it can be used by bad people but of course not when it's used by the right people on their laws typically just inhibit good people from having guns not bad people so\nWhen you talk you've done a lot of research in this book is titled by the way it's first freedom a ride to Americans and during history with the guns in Redmond basically the history of the gun role it played in America throughout when you talk to people do you find that there are a considerable number of people who really don't\nKnow what's the role was I think it was much much less than it actually was\n[noise] that it's much less yeah I mean I'm In Washington DC right now and I would say that most people I mentioned the sort of stories of the gun ... never knew about how important it was I mean just take some take Sam cold for instance that people understand\nHow what a an incredible personality was how he changed the world with a interchangeable parts long before Henry Ford that did anything of that nature and they don't understand that he was sort of the first industrial is in that guns are such a big deal and that\nYou know he sold them and and change the way that we sell things to people and he went to England and open a factor all the things that I don't take the\nHistorians glorify him in the way they do other inventors for instance because it was a gun and they view guns in a you know in a negative way\nWell you know once you start doing your research you realize that the industrial revolution in America hinged on firearms you know was interchangeable parts it was all of these advancements that we take for granted and that as you say people attribute to him before no no no our sample was doing a\nRoom and didn't was doing it people making guns were doing it long before\nAnd that was you know gun valley was where the industrial revolution actually took place\nYeah absolutely the first industrial revolution driven by gun manufacturing I mean there are other things involved but\nA gun manufacturers were on the you know the cutting edge of the of the technology of the day you know Sam Cole had his factory in Hartford and it was almost it reminds me when I read about it it reminds me a little bit like Google or something today where people lived on campus and they were very immersed in like the business aspect of it but [noise]\nUm he was an amazing man and it wasn't just him there were many engineers out there doing incredible things and uh guns definitely were big driving part of that commerce in America\nYou know and I'm looking at some of the chapters you have your the peace dividend you're talking about a modern rifles or the fall in the fall and rising sharp shooters I'm calling from Chris Kyle\nYou got you know you really are tracking the kind of the rule of firearms what's the goal why did you do this book and the first place\n[noise] well I I've been you know most I write about politics and I've been very involved in the debates over a Second Amendment for you know Fifteen Years and um it's very important to me even though I live in places where it's hard to get guns or maybe because I live in those places but\nThe reason was I think that we're always arguing about the ideology and the politics of guns into safety and the mass shootings and kind of those things and they're important to talk about [noise]\nBut we've never talked about is why guns are certainly better than the DNA of this country and why people [noise]\nUh you know and people always ask me you know why is America so different what's with the gun culture you know we're Ringo they're always sort of smearing it the gun culture well\nIt didn't just pop up and you know Nineteen Seventy seven it's been around from the beginning and I wanted people to know what that story was and why the guy who's buying a gun today shock on air fifty whatever why he is has that guy and why he cares about that gun and why he is\nA responsible with that guy and he understands maybe the history even if he if he doesn't know every part of it he under its ... part of a sort of cultural continue on you know\nAnd and he feels he or she feels an intrinsic\nConnection to out here it's John Wayne the mythical west where the real west or to the revolutionary war on people who founded the country because they had their own personal firearms which is all we really had become a\nWhether they can voice it or not they feel they knew what they knew that they are simply the latest in the continuation from two hundred and Thirty years ago\n[noise] right I mean and it might you know I Can't think of anything else off of hand right now that has that that connects people who stood at length Lexington to people today and America is meeting as a sort of thing that they owned an ad and I'm sure there are others but it is the very end up very American thing\nYou know and he mentioned every weapon was a

right on point there Roberts on four out of all curse California hey Robert wash the view from California\nTo here I'm On the right side of the state anyway I Want to congratulate you though on coming around about the Democrats I remember hearing you and I watched your watch growth and I have a sister who's a Democrat and she's pretty radical too\nAnd and I've seen through it for ever it's like the Democrats a Democrat who supports a the second amendment I Can't think of them you can you\nKnow the ... you get something to give you a little bit of Joe Manchin is probably as close as we get and you never know there but yeah but you know my whole thing harbor and to me about just south of us there probably are still\nDemocrats that I could agree with on some things Democrats I'm Talking about elected politicians now the problem is though every elected politicians you put in who's a Democrat\nIt reinforces the power of the below sea Feinstein a barber you know the whole ... ball if you will of the ultra left is so that even if you say well this is a good Democrat a vote for that person is actually vote for policy and Feinstein\nAnd they're all from California and we're we're we're we're heading towards Venezuela\nYeah exactly well I I appreciate the call and yeah I I don't like that this is where we are I Wish we had\nA system where you could say let's just choose the right person regardless of party but that's just not the way it is and to do that to vote honestly if you're a person who supports gun rights\nYou can't you sorry you just can't\nVote for Democrats even if that person individually as okay on gun rights that person helps below sea and Feinstein by simply by being there and being a vote beat a person on the Democratic side and gets them control of Congress and they get to decide\nWho heads up the committee's they get to decide which laws get our bills get brought up for vote and they get to decide who is going to be confirmed for Supreme Court justice as I said every single week leading up to two thousand sixty election\nThis election was not about Hillary Clinton and it was not about Donald Trump it was about the United States Supreme court\nWe now see that coming to pass imagine if\nYou will if Hillary Clinton was president just just\nProcess that for a second let's say a Eric's on the line one out of Olympia, Washington Eric Washington state because you're in the middle of it there aren't you\nOh boy you have no idea yeah it's unbelievable what was your take is you're watching these hearings\nRecoiled in or I really got a good glimpse of what these people are capable of their color carry into card they'll stop at nothing to gain and keep power and they're the same type of people who destroyed Venezuela\nFor that reason I Will never allow them to take like that you cannot\nDisarm yourself in the face of people like this\nLet me ask you a question I might put you on the spot okay guess nobody knows who you are really when you say will never let them take your guns what does that mean\n[laughter] well that means if it ever comes down to the point where they're collecting guns it's time to use your guts\nAnd ...\nAnd I think that's what it means for millions of people appreciate the call thank you sir yeah I Love the me myself I said well let's see there's three hundred million\nAnd ... or ... a hundred million gun owners we have three hundred million guns and we have a trillion rounds of ammunition\nTwo things one if we were the problem I think you know it but the other thing is have you really thought this through we had a call from laid it did not want to be on the air joy and but she wanted to point out something I was going to pass this long she says\nBillions and billions of rounds of ammunition had been sold so more guns where people carry loaded guns billions of rounds of ammunition and gun violence is down by Seventy percent according to\nThe FBI's uniform claim reports\n[noise]\nTheir their brain dead I'm Sorry the their brain dead simple is not a line three Dan is with us out of Reed point Montana Dan you're on TALK\n[noise] I um I I just wanted to follow up on what you were talking about just a short time ago if you vote for a Democrat who is supposedly pro gun or a gamble Jon Tester here in Montana right he may vote for a good bill that that\nCome out the second amendment however he also voted against both Gorsuch can cabin off and he voted for a Kagan ... out of my aren't being wanting to work so beyond just being along with a ...\nThat's an excellent point because with the extremely rare exceptions are going to vote party line there but basically what that means is they are going to do what polo sea and Feinstein tell them to do\nCrash so I go back to a vote for any Democrat is the vote for policy and Feinstein\nBut it's also vote for a an anti gun jurists on the Supreme Court\nAbsolutely because the vote that you just place for ... for Feinstein in policy means that they get to choose the jurors they want on the Supreme Court all goes back to any Democrat who gets elected is I I'm not a piece of power\nFor the Democratic leadership where whether it's are posing Gorsuch Kavanaugh or supporting Kagan Sotomayor or all the rest of it it's an excellent point down I appreciate that we do you're right and yeah I Know\nI was four come into it and I get it [noise] I don't like the way it is but you know what the tuning in something is not the way it is just foolish ... mature kid is counterproductive in this case that we have to figure this out and say okay this is real simple [noise] my ideal is no Democrat has\nNever\nWas [noise]\nDamn three boys a compact [noise]\n\nAbout to go and get you and your line on Jim's with us out of Nebraska hey Jim you're on gun talk what's up\n[noise] yes [noise] a judge Kavanaugh ah I'm Glad that he was confirmed ... I could not listen to a Mrs Ford\nI just couldn't I couldn't I couldn't listen to her couldn't stand her voice I knew she was a liar but Mr\nKevin I have reservations on him or he is a Bush\nIs from the swamp spent his whole life in Washington DC I'm afraid he's going to be more of a Justice Roberts and a a one of the\nConservative the more Roberts than Scalia\nOh yes by far by far and and that's that's my fear ... and\nI understand given the background let me throw this actually though I'm looking at what a\nJudge Kavanaugh wrote two thousand eleven\nAnd a case where he actually descended on with the district court a D.C court he said that quoted would strain logic in common sense\nThat the second amendment would allow semi automatic hand guns but not semi automatic rifles which has not traditionally been banned in common used today\nAnd us are protected under Heller\nHis point was there these assault weapons so called assault weapons bans they don't ban semi automatic handgun she says I'm Sorry that does not stand that doesn't make any sense at all and Heller says anything in common you cannot be banned and so he actually talked about that during the the hearings as well\nThat speaks pretty well for him from where I didn't\nI I just I just don't like it association with Bush is it's\nA [laughter] I I don't disagree with you there because ...\nI voted for both of them and I voted against the Democrat what I Would not have voted for either one of them had there\nBeen some a conservative choice\nYeah I agree I agree I think Ronald Reagan was not a friend of gun owners\nI recall way back there people are already knew no he did not do us any favors and non editing he just happened to be better than the alternative Bush's we're not friends to gun owners they were just better than the alternative in this case yeah he served under Bush really worked there\nI I Am more enthusiastic perhaps and maybe a little bit less cautious than you are in this one I now understand I I don't think you get an absolute rabid you know the second amendment person\nIn any of these folks but having said that his history of decisions is really good really strong and Second Amendment I I think we're going to be OK\nJustice Thomas [noise] it's probably in my opinion the most gun friendly adjust what do you think\nI agree completely I think you're on the money he has several times invited\nA cases to come we're wish we could get some of these and then when they were turning them down he would write you know it looks like we're we're turning the second amendment into a second class well law are are ... are right and also saying that you know we're basically turning our backs on health are so Thomas has been strong\nI think you're going to find that uh the Kevin Thomas connections going to be strong as well\n\nSo we will find out I guess I mean that's that's where we are again thank you for your call and I'm I'm not saying you're wrong and I think it's good to be cautious but hey you know what we have him and ultimately as I say this is what the election was about was it ... Brock Obama said elections\nHave consequences yeah well you try to ... doesn't our face when he said that were once back the way we the people spoke we elected Donald Trump because because we wanted the Supreme Court and that's\nPretty much was the primary reason for a lot\nOf them was that\nAnd there's a new company actually an old company getting the gun off it's going to want to hear because you're already like this guy [noise]\n[noise]\nAre you looking for places she\nPracticed coins online wrong and and selling them on line or probably even worse 'cause you got to ship 'em off to some

journalist Jamal ...\nWhat we're good at is making things at work or make things that have been thought through from an engineering standpoint\nUm and also from a quality standpoint um if you're putting that on your firearm dislike are laser lights for personal defense you're really needs to work when you want it to so we took that same approach to the engineering and the acquisition of these products as well so they\nThey're not they're not anything different in terms of quality that you would expect from ...\nWell that's interesting that's kind of burying the lead as we say because to say well it's\nOh they're not different from what you expect from us except that what you expect from criminal trace is the very best you guys have always been I mean you're so top of mind when somebody sneaks lasers site a weapon amount of laser the price because you're it's been your category so you're\nThere's a real responsibility I mean you're the guy the top and you got to be looked at this and thinking you know one we're now asking the firearms market to trust us in a new area because you have an enormous bank of trust there\nAnd that's got to be a daunting when you're thinking about bringing out new products\nYeah it's a big responsibility and one that we take seriously and as you say it's the market leader and really the innovator in laser sites um we went out at at took our time a way that it with the\nThe idea that our customer who trusts us for what they know us for today is going to trust you know we hope is going to trust us for something that they don't know as for today but that\nThat goodwill that we've built up over all these years and the expectation of quality of customer service you know I think our customer services as good as any ones in the industry um if anyone ever has a problem with our products\nOr thinks they have a you know any issue with our products we're here to stand behind it all of those things\nAre being brought to bear on the on the opportunity for the new products for example a rifle scopes a lifetime warranty\nOn those are our electronic sites that same warranty as her laser sites you know three years but really if you have an issue with it and and you know it's a product problem just like we do all the way through will will find a way to take care of you know so\nIt it was a big responsibility for us but you know is what we do every day so um we didn't really need to change our our philosophy we just need to focus it on a new set of products\nDid you were able to tap in because I mean I've been to your place there and you've got some really really smart folks there were you able to tap into that brain trust on on what to include and what to do with these uh read that\n[noise] yeah you know we were fortunate in like a lot of companies in the industry where some of our engineers most of them and a lot of other products people in particular in customer ... support people their users their power users of our products um you know Gary killings worth and different people who have been on the show\nFrom time to time um he's actually a gun site right now are putting the products through the paces so\nWe have that that brain trust of engineers and product people in customer service people who also listen to the customer uh we we you know it isn't it isn't always what we think very much for the customer wants\n'em and over the years we've heard when we've asked you know what what else might you consider from crimes and trace and products that were coming out with what we're always on the top of the list and um you know now is the right time with\nA new ownership and and really just a a kind of a new chapter for the business to go after those markets\nWell it's interesting it also comes an interesting time of course you've got products here for three gun which is usually popular uh obviously for rifles but I Am seeing real the increase of serious increase in people\nWho are willing to put a red that site on their self defense carry pistol are you seeing that are you hearing that\nYou know we see more and more of that um it's it's interesting to see different manufacturers glock and others who are is our parent company of the pie from Smith in Washington and come comes out\nWith a slide that's already a cut for these kinds of optics so you know it's something that they are the consumer is asking for it used to be a custom is Asian and sometimes not a very simple\nCustomers Asian now as you say more and more people want that I'm not just for the three ... and the other guys who are helping using these for years but for concealed carry product a laser sites are great not everybody may want to lose your site and so these are as a ... or cited in low light but they're they're frankly a little better during daylight\nYeah exactly so All right so ah are you calling this anything special a different name or they just call him some trace read outside\nYou know so they're they're branded crimson trace a wave after you know almost twenty five years of using the same brand in the same logo on it made sense to upgrade an update our logo so you'll see a slightly it's the same name you know the tea\nOr his are kind of marker brand bark but we've we've changed a little bit updated it\nAnd then also added three ... three focus categories kind of sub categories protection tactical and sport\nUm that that moved to San expands us into those other markets so\nAh today at least all the products are ... are coming out in the crimson traced brand um we we felt

might say my retirement accounts were at point hey now they're at point B so obviously there are going to eventually be at points see\nLet's explain this to numbers instead of letters you might be

three let's get back\nTo our example your retirement account was that point a than a route to point B so obviously if you draw a line from point a through point be your retirement account will continue to grow on the same path to point see we see this train of thought over and over again as we look at the history of investments\nPoint to a at the beginning of the tech boom in Nineteen Ninety five\nPoint be the top of the tech boom and year two thousand and yet so many people bought or held on to stocks at point B expecting that stocks would continue to grow to point to say\nHere's another example point aid the start of the housing price bubble around Nineteen Ninety five point be the top of the housing bubble in two thousand six yet people were still buying houses like mad just before the housing bubble crashed expecting that they would continue to rise to point see\nWhat crashes next the bond market precious metals national debt the stock market again who knows all you can

happen\nCould have stocks continued to rise instead of crashing after the dot com bubble yes that's possible could have housing prices continue to rise after two thousand six once again that's possible the problem is many investors take what is possible and they start to believe it is probable or worse yet a certain fact\nAdding fuel to the fire and there are plenty of people that contribute to this appeal to probability just watched the financial news on cable when the market goes up you can literally feel the energy coming from the talking heads on your TV there are so

my home when I wasn't here for obvious reasons that we're doing a welfare check\nAnd that's fine and good I have no qualms about that but when I did discuss the matter with the local police chief and by the way this isn't Waco proper it said ... it's a a suburb you say I'm\nA ... he wasn't quite feeling me on the same thing that you were talking about a just a few minutes ago about criminals dressed up as a leash\nOr you know that it could have been very tragic long story short I did have the opportunity to meet with a small town mayor and the police shape and we did iron it out and he did apologize on behalf of the department and promised to review his policies and procedures [noise]\nWhat was he not I mean when you said look this could have gone badly if I've been at home I Would have shot whoever commend the door I assume that's roughly what you said\nThat's exactly what I said what was his reaction to that\n[noise] um [noise] it it was pretty a brisk a it was kind of um you know he wasn't happy with a citizen telling him that\n[laughter] yeah well can subjects right that\nThat's just that's just the gist of it right there he was not happy with us and telling them hey I Would I Would have shot to defend my home and even at your officers were in uniform would have done\nThat is because I and our reference a charm all if you do an Internet search just as you discussed a few minutes ago that you will see several news articles of criminal doing home invasions dressed as police and and I told them\nIt took that are set those high powered rifle at ... shock on and so forth my train with it every year I Do a um a tactical training a course for today it in this area every year every year I go\nMhm was he surprised at that\nHe was a little bit surprised but not

or call me on the phone in my house and say hey we're at the local police we're outside your door we need you to walk outside cool I'll do that if the knock on the door and say where did you come outside now cool I'll do that\nThey don't have to kick in my door if they know which are actually coming for me so I have to assume whoever's kicking in a door\nIs does not wish me any\nPeople need to

sense after a year to what's going on\nWhat's really interesting to me is how often\nHome invasions are in the middle of the day because we are going to be like two o'clock in the morning well no not always in fact not even most of the ... you'll find that a lot of these break ins horror the middle of the day\nAnd SARS where people say well you know I Want my doors at night really [laughter] how

unsafe so in other words you can sell these guns you can buy these guys and then several years ago they said yes and one of the things these guys are all going to have to have this micro stamping which wants to manufacture said yeah except that it doesn't exist we can't yeah Microsoft and\nSo when a gun falls off the list and any time you ... manufactured changes something in a God it falls off the list and it's required to be re submitted except now you can't we submitted anything because nothing has microscopic how'd I Do\nThat's ... that's exactly right I mean in a way to make very practical California the generation or clock illegal to sell in California\nWow okay so in the list get smaller and smaller because you have to manufacture says well we're going to change the safety\nIt I thought he was working really hard and then I found out he's trying to buy Astros playoff guy at a very red go ahead go ahead I but I Know I Know I you know Astros come first comes second

all started doesn't start with wages which by the way are stagnant tell anyone tell you um [noise]\nIt it doesn't start with tax cuts it doesn't start with any of that it starts with health care healthy educated people work healthy educated people pay taxes healthy educated people put back into their communities healthy educated people are what funding infrastructure and fund the government

term elections\nThe inhabitants residents raped the women might harm or kill the men and steer what they can't\n[noise] of course the idea is the reason that they would come in dressed as police their jackets and say police and yelling police is so no one shoots them\nThat this was a horrible situation and the options none of them are real good here\nYou're in your house\nMinding your own business you're not a drug dealer you're not a bad guy you're not expecting the police to kick in your door\nAnd somebody has pounding on your door and then it gets broken in and people start pouring through your busted in door\nYou're probably going to do when I'm going to do I'm oh shoot him\nI'm going to shoot them\nNow here's where it gets messy because I Am going to assume because one I'm a good guy I don't do you know and I don't do drugs don't sell drugs I you know I'm no one that police should logical you have any interest in\nTherefore I assume that anybody who's breaking into my home and come running through the door after they've broken down is a bad guy\nI Will act accordingly I Will respond to that they said well what if they're wearing uniforms yeah they're gonna get shot you\nKnow what's going to be a ... day for everybody concerned\nThey're going to get shot to why would you do that because the bad guys do that to do a search through Internet search for home invasion you're dressed as police are personally place you will find a lot of cases like this\nThat puts us in a tough place it also puts the police in a really bad place\nI Would offer that if you are a police officer\nOn the team that does dynamic injuries you might want to review I'm sure you do but you might want to again review your policies and procedures to make doubly in Tripoli sure that the place you're going the right place\nAnd yeah you know it's one of those deals that there's probably not a good conclusion to a scenario like that\nProblem is I mean if you don't want I Would love to know if you have another way of treating this or if you're a police officer and you've got another take on this man I Would love to hear because I've I've been thinking about this the ... I Can't come up with a scenario that turns out well it\nWas kind of situation and this one this guy was fortunate police did not shoot him he didn't kill these police officers and the police in charge and they said hey you know what you have to be our number here say six six talked gun to disarm you\nTom Sawyer going look at the range of forces also\nAbout that kind of situation home invasions slices of Asians police\nDo you have time to waste the figure it out or do you just take action copyright back [noise]\n\nThis is yeah the black hills ammunition new rifle ammunition lining the street corner these extreme low drag mullahs designed to make step forward and longest performance\nWhen you want the ability to shoot way out in\nWith accuracy trajectory minimal impact how real the ammunition is the right choice\nI'm listening causation Black Hills ammunition carry manufactured gives you the advantage\nAre you looking for at least in\nWhere to shoot dot or\nLarger database shooting range is on the Internet\nAlso ... ... where do you find video\nPerhaps more than any other landscape went last embodied the light giving a bundle nature has to offer and perhaps more than any other organization ducks unlimited and he's working to ensure that our calmness wetlands and not only serve buying\nGenerations and well beyond just one [noise] and I now to band together and\nTime is now\nTo rescue our wet labs and\nIt's the next generation target pistol VSW twenty to victory from Smith in Washington stainless steel frame interchangeable match barrel dumps safety fiber optic sites and up tickets any rail\nThe S.

W. twenty to victory at ... dot com\nAnd that's just yeah let's go straight to the phones lying to them is is with us out of Waco, Texas he had something happened to him but I Want to hear about hey Dennis what happened man [noise]\nHey Tom [noise] um well actually I wasn't home when this happened I'm a ...\nNine one one call a\nCaused by a neighbor's cell phone calls the police to break into my home when I wasn't here for obvious reasons that we're doing a welfare check\nAnd that's fine and good I have no qualms about that but when I did discuss the matter with the local police chief and by the way this wasn't Waco proper it's a ... it's a suburb you I'm\nA ... he wasn't quite feeling me on the same thing that you were talking about\nA just a few minutes ago about criminals dressed up as a leash oh yeah that could have been very tragic long story short\nI I did have the opportunity to meet with a small town mayor and the police shape and we did iron it out and he did apologize on behalf of the department and promised to reveal his policies and procedures [noise]\nWhat was he not I mean when you said look this could have gone bad if I've been at home I Would have shot whoever came in the door I assume that roughly what\nYou said that's exactly what I said what was his reaction to that\n[noise] um it it was pretty a brisk a it was kind of um you know he wasn't ... with a citizen telling him that\n[laughter] yeah well Congress up next right that\nThat's just that's just the gist of it right there he was not happy with us and telling them hey I Would\nI Would have shot to defend my home and even at your officers or in uniform what have done that is because I and our reference a charm all if you do an Internet search shift as you discussed a few minutes ago that he will see several news articles of criminal doing home invasions dressed as police and and I told them it\nThat I said those high powered rifle happy ha to shock on and so forth my train with it every year I didn't pay 'em a tactical training course for civilian in this area every year every year I go\n... was he surprised at that\nHe was a little bit surprised but not much\nI mean here's the thing I\nSaid look if the police need me coming\nHere to talk to Tom Gresham or if they want to arrest Tom Gresham [noise] all they have to do is knock\nOn my door or call me on the phone in my house and say hey we're at the local police we're outside your door we do you do to walk outside cool I'll do that if the knock on the door and say we need you to come outside now cool I'll do that\nThey don't have to kick in my door if they know which they're actually coming for me so I have to assume whoever's kicking in a door\nIs does not\nWish me any good will they're there to do me harm that's it's the only safe assumption because anybody who picks on my door is there to do harm\nAnd you know there are at some point I may share there are things you can do that really simple it will cost you executives zero dollars that could keep somebody from opening your door\nUm which I got from a white guy [laughter] uh I mean physically keeps the door for being opened\nI'm going to have some problem I got to give us some salt whereas I Want to share that are not ah but I'm so glad that you had that conversation with them and then it's one of those deals you have to say well look officer if if you're at home and somebody kicks in your door what are you going to be doing\nWell that's where the mayor came in uh the mayor did see it on my perspective on that he he totally agree to set you know what I understand your perspective is that I Would have done the same thing\nYou know and the other thing is I Know\nAnd consistent action to deter that kind of behavior and only when the police you know I think it needs to be a nationwide effort if this is a sham that you're talking about the criminal the catchy onto it is becoming very common [noise]\nYeah and it's in and look if you want to really get a police officer angry you get somebody who's in personal being a police officer man that took them off about as much as anything I Know with good reason\nBut it now it's become what they've done is they've put everybody in danger they put the homeowners in danger they put the police in danger with this whole impersonation deal and you know all you got to do and it's just when you get a chance to get out of your car through a little search you'll find different a number of these cases of the home and the other thing that's happened is home invasions [noise]\nA lot of times now have gone from one person just six people doing home invasions and it's one of the reasons that I I think you can call one of the reasons I said\nPeople need to rethink\nTheir home defense guts this also of course we're talking about you know\nHow'd you know what's going on out there well you know what could go back to what a great sponsors the blink cameras\nYou could turn on your camera out there looking at your phone's if somebody's town on the door he'd go oh yeah that's a bunch of police officers out there that's the real deal there's like six cop cars out there okay\nOr no that doesn't look right now you may not have time to do all that because this stuff typically happens fast it happens in the middle of the night they want to do it while you're asleep as much as they can\nA kitchen REM sleep they're going to be in the house before anything happens in whether it's a good guys were the bad guys\n[noise]\nIf your doors [laughter] how many times have you heard me talk about you know you do not open the door to find out who's on the other side of if you don't know who's on the other side don't open the door the corollary to that\nIs how secure our your doors\nI mean if they're ... the worst and there's not much of a walk on there or not much of a system\nHow hard how hard is it to get in oh one other thing if you started doing is I Do every day I Do uh basically it's like a clip service but you knew where the Google Alerts system\nAnd find new stores that say home invasion can you start reading a dozen of these a day you get a sense after a year to what's going on\nWhat's really interesting to me is how often\nHome invasions are in the middle of the day because we always think it's going to be like two o'clock in the morning well no not always in fact not even most of the you'll find that a lot of these break ins horror the middle of the day\nAnd SARS where people say well you know I Want my doors at night [noise] really [laughter] how about just lock your doors whenever you're there what is lucky Georgia Time it buys you time\nIf you had have you in addition oh ten or Fifteen seconds\nYou could get to your gun you could get you know to safety you could get to a safe place you could go somewhere in lock the door you could hunker your people together\nTime that's all a gun saved us for you by your time\nAnybody can get into a gun safe as they have enough time for that does is it says well this is going to be thirty seconds of thirty minutes or an hour or two hours forty\nCan break in the hour we'll go somewhere else so you think about what her own level where we're going to be do we know what he's got a new Supreme Court justice and\nThe question is what's that going to mean for us for gun rights there are a number of cases that you're either headed toward because we ... we come back I was talking about he wants to live ... Supreme Court our number here eight six six talk done time on Russia's [noise]\n\n\nStand for the second amendment with Franklin armory new three position be\nTo the fire moms in this [noise] good luck to\nAnd your Tom rational gun\nSix six talked hunters dial Tom talked gun they'll get you into the conversation here one of the things a lot of us have been well frankly honestly smiling about for about a week now would be would there is a justice Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court the battle was content just mean nasty slimy\nUgly and probably ultimately helpful to the G O P\nAnd motivating an awful lot of people to vote who made his kind of slip through the midterms by the Twenty one days from today Twenty one days when do they do not voting shame on you get off your rear end getting gear simple as that so what is going to mean to us that Brett Kavanaugh\nIs on the Supreme Court there are some cases that are headed toward the Supreme Court and some that probably will get their joined me to talk about that and kind of this plot the sound a little bit Jeanne Hoffman a from Cal guns or hey gene\n[laughter] I don't know about you I've been smiling for about a week now\n[laughter] absolutely but I still on a CD ... see what I Want to see the ... granted I was yeah we're actually\nWell exactly ... or ... one of the things that are I guess just to cover very quickly when cases the requests search your ... search uh basically they asked the Supreme Court to accept them it takes four votes to be accepted obviously takes five votes to win\nIn the past on a lot of important Sacramento cases have been turned down by the Supreme Court they somebody would not even accept them\nWe don't exactly know why but the thinking is maybe internally they said you know we're not going to have the five votes to win it's let's not take it at this level and make it a precedent the Supreme Court precedent let's just not even take the case\nThat okay it was run the math for us now I mean is it really five four are we now look that up for four plus Roberts as a swing we still don't know what's going on with him\nYou know I'm worried it may be the latter than the kind of internal conversation about how we kind of just five was always a question of whether it was Kennedy or Roberts who was the person who was saying yes that these cases had real interest I mean\nSome of these cases that weren't granted I had a Thomas riding sent saying we're treating the second one it like a second class right so you know\nThe first thing to see is whether or not we're dealing with chief wanting to keep the court you know out of certain political arena is um you know ... one of the potential negatives of this adult for the justice\nComing for is that it may make she wants to wait forty ... [noise]\nOh I see to let it settled down to say some people say well see now this is what that was it was all about ... Supreme Court and the second amendment and guns and all and he said look let's just let it settled for a while ...\nYeah and unfortunately opposite that's actually that's not the case but it is the risk by what side we certainly you know how for solid boats at all it's like\nOkay what if you would run through a few of the cases that either are you know already been appeal to the Supreme Court are headed that way logically and you know because there's some really important ones out there\nBut it's it's it's basically when it matters I'm white now sitting in front of them is um California and gun roster where uh they they can make it so you can't sell a new maker my oldest firearm\nAnd gun in California that singing in front of them also a mass out of Texas where people from DC we're trying to buy\nFirearms from Texas dealer like they could buy rifles\nAnd that was that returned to buy the circuit that's now but the ones that are I think\nEven more critical um you have magazine vans are both from the east coast here in California\nThose cases are likely to work quickly as we California they've been on a Malian join or the other things that are out there I'm In California you know we kind of famously warned them then had overturned on ... that the state to let us carrying somewhat\n... that was not granted start a fall on it by ... younger ... Hawaii or the panel said well you don't have the right ... and I have right area so you must be equal in Hawaii\nUm we expect that to be overturned on ... but that's again pretty scary where Supreme Court order\nYou know I'd like to return to that first case because I'm not sure that people outside of California fully appreciate what the hand gun lost her is\nAnd how it has been corrupted now there is a foregone to be able to be sold at a dealership in California\nThe state has to approve the specific model of the gun has to be a submitted by the manufacturer and then put on the list of not unsafe\nGot which I Love going right not unsafe cuts so in other words you can sell these guys you can buy these guys and then several years ago they said yes and one of the things these guys are all going to have to have this micro stamping\nAt which point the manufacturers said yeah except that it doesn't exist we can't yet micro stamp\nSo when a gun falls off the list and anytime you manufacture changes something in a God it falls off the list and it's required to be re submitted except now you can't we submitted anything because nothing has microscopic how'd I Do\nThat's ... that's exactly right I mean and and the way to make this very practical California generation or clock illegal to sell in California\nWow okay so in the list get smaller and smaller because if a manufacturer says well we're going to change the safety\nSo here in California all Democrats the Republicans don't even have a super majority or the game to see who is for the the left on these issues so it just continues to Russia\nHas the state man this is kind of a weird question has the state's simply gone that far to where the people there don't see this is a problem\nYou know it's a weird thing here you have a very large number of practically democratic a gun 'cause you're still is the largest single retail market the last ...\nWhere are all these restrictions\nSo you know I I think it's gotten to where where are these things intrude on the people who are rational ... what's going on around them so you know it's one of the frog didn't really know you're boiling yet\n[noise] ah well I mean I just I'm just looking in a letter I got from the guy says hey I'm a gun owner I you know I'd have to plan my ... my cold dead hands but this name was semi automatic rifles you know we've got to do something about\nThat you weren't why ... why yeah those are those who are inconsistent\nThat's right well you know what people people have very odd about this with often more emotional as rational\n... the goodness this though to come back to our original point\nAlmost every single case here in California that we haven't won shut was based on the Ninth Circuit and the intermediate scrutiny dressed up as rational basis for everybody else the government not be put like making real\nPrevent a single Supreme Court case that discusses this basically wiped out all of the law allowed us to go through the entire cycle that\nReally you know yeah I don't know about the ... is a lot of the law survived because they aren't that much of a burden on the need to get more and more to earn it just\nMakes sense so [noise] you know and I know you you have your fingers out there you're talking to a lot of the key people all the civil rights lawyers who are working on second remember stuff [noise]\nWhat are they saying in terms of what's the game plan now but the Supreme Court has changed\nWell I think you know the answer is we want to get as many of these are strong challenges in front of the Supreme Court and in some ways tried to bring them some of the challenges that I think are less radioactive a\nMagazine side ban like California to ski legally owned ten magazines so ... that's the kind of level where the headlines yeah scream court does not look out of out of normal out of touch by saying of course the state government can't property from people that's protected by the ...\nRight right okay so basically they're they're working on it now they're looking at which are the ones that are most likely to go through to be successful you know and they build their case to start building it sounds like building blocks they start and then the building that perfect\n... and we now have you want to keep things and carry which is you know there were arguable whether Illinois area case was about the weapons are or what it is a very clear\nThese PKK which DC was worries about ...\n... thank you so much I appreciate it more than you know always a pleasure to be here\nAnd we will get you back on soon because this is Bruce he followed All right we're open lines for you now eight six six gun range reports are welcome as are pretty much anything else if it's on your mind we have an open line for you just give me a call ... ...
