the very learned build power the second one is called the intel over wash you can follow the bill on Twitter at\nIntel over watch a circle navigation to the global understanding the nuances and historical context of geopolitical activity William\nUm\nWe were talking about China earlier in reference to the trade wars going on a you talk about the ... of their currency being weak although being propped up uh that you referred to them as a paper dragon\nWell they have a lot of debt underlined or expansion and the thing that's been propping up their economy and allowing them to expand like that has been the fact that they've been able to block us imports into their country charging terrorists\nAnd then being able to sell products over here Tara free so um they have inflated their economy now that we're starting to see the ripple effects some of the cracks and their financial foundation or ...\nAnd the show ... there's been like and I think last a few weeks there's been a drop in the Chinese stock Mark Mark at a higher than the ... Brazil Russia together\n[noise] ah so\n... Z. is being put in a position that he had to make a deal because\nThey are prepared if the people were willing to sacrifice their alarm trade war to probably win however in the meantime the people have gotten used to this great wealth because it made this huge leap from a bicycle to Mercedes right into this gradual work your way up like we have in America\nAnd they're starting to be a little bit of ripple effect or ... dissension and some of the provinces\nNow that's a good thing it's a good thing for us uh what else goes on with China these days\nWell a mini things as their leaps and a I uh but the probably the biggest thing I think it's a telling is the fact that we had to us warships sell sell between the street doing Taiwan mainland China started hundreds of miles wide international waters\nExtremely upset ... busy and the military there there were shattered by the Chinese that's when that hasn't been done and like many years\nIt was kind of an insult to Z and his\nMindset that that is their area and people shouldn't be going there and then not to in like the freedom of navigation operation a couple of weeks ago when us destroyer was outside the twelve my limit of what used to be there at that island and was chased off\nSo is are are going through a a slap in the face in response to their challenging to the freedom of navigation\nYep and then that they take it as a major political insult and that they have already on this area and we need to back off but meanwhile they're also a ... trying to exert themselves not necessarily on the waters but also in five gee\nUh networks that's the coming thing and cell phone already there they have Chinese companies around the globe joined a bed for certain countries five jeez network\nUm one of the things that was interesting when Germany as are willing to lead Germany inspectors their software to make sure there's nothing that can be used against the Germans were used for spying but of course software can always be upgraded ah\nAbout five ... as part of their uh one belt one road initiative to be able to control the flow and information and so what this allows cone activity anywhere on the earth eventually it's super high speeds\nKnowing that they were guilty of that back door or that they put in whatever that the the ... on there\nSo knowing that that is the case how could any a modern nation in good conscience do business with them as it pertains to any sort of a sell your data transfer or anything that could be infringed upon hacked or a manipulated how would anybody in good conscience do business with them\nThey can't get conscience little surprises right and this is not just a recent event with the a chip that was put in there before oh come on a start up before the operating system would pick up so that way the operating system wouldn't take it up\nA the done this with putting back doors one's a hard drives and other that's been going on for a good Eighteen years\nAnd every time we stop a one way case in point with the cell phones issue with the uh the or the cell phones US Army bases ... uh yeah there are there are\nThere ways find another way around it fool me once shame on you\nAnd and then again it's kind of like what you said a while back you know these five gee networks all be controlled that those notes by artificial intelligence why always keep going back to artificial intelligence ... said whoever controls and wins a I wore will control and ruled the world\nAnd where is Russia as it pertains to that not as far as China but they are trying to develop their own AI but it's not going to be necessarily on the five gee network so where where\nWell we're going to ... uh we have some degree we're not to the point where China is actually working on a high human hybrid soldiers are they actually apparently has some cyborg dish type a candidates are ready to earn the of\nDevelopment so by the you'll buy in the future\nLook to see the ... control the battlefield for all these enhanced ... soldiers\nWere working on her own but we're not as far DARPA has and and not quite as far as the Chinese can we just feel their technology\nWell that's the problem is they have built in a it's harder to get stuff out of China than it is out of the U.S\nBase in point is how the hip blocked American access in the markets while we've opened up are at a markets and the case a like a Chinese Chinese invested a U.S company they want a position on the board\nThere people in the employees in the management\nHas calculated it smart ... it's a it's a multi dimensional chess game but with the potential failing of the trade war on their part on the fact that there there there is some unrest in their country\nHave they miscalculated the timeline\nNo I don't think them necessarily miscalculated but here's the thing is you have to understand about China strategy is multi layered strategy ideally they'd like to win on every layer but if they lose on one layer ... to ... or ... ... dominance on another layer\nAlright okay I'm watching them uh I've\nBeen watching them for a long time and the fact we did the NAFTA deal like we did and you know watching all those jobs going to Mexico than those jobs going to China and ... you know the whole thing was focus on building up their country to get it modernized increase the capability the military to be in competition with us\nYeah at the end of the day though the lobbyist in Washington to manipulate at this and are to a ... a cheap labor\nExactly when also it's the cheap labor but at the same time the lobbyist would exert political pressure for anybody that was starting to sound the warning bills to destroy their career in the military or intelligence agencies\nEffectively so I guess yes and there was a member on the congressional intelligence can be a committee who has been instrumental in stopping any ah investigation into Chinese spying recently they busted a Chinese by made it to Belgium Belgium actually is extradite him to the U.S [noise]\nUh and who is the person is a council of it is not a facilitating American security well\nThere's actually more than one but two is her last name ... and then find science ... why do you think\nThat is I mean I I Know the Clintons a facilitated a Ukrainian uh situation with excuse me the uranium situation with the Russians and also the Chinese of the trade in the free flow but the technology\nSo he had ties to Saudi until apparently massage and CIA and why\nDid the Turks go out of their way to a reveal their hand but they've bug the Saudi embassy MB why are they going out of the way to embarrass the Saudis what is already gone to play here well about\nFive days after the disappearance and there's this great video of the show again during the moon walk backwards out of the Saudi consulate that the Saudis is released it and made\nIt that joke he was doing there were just [laughter] ... well\nYeah and they even tried to get a body double in there but that didn't work out too much and it's funny the main intelligence had that was run that operation I kind of made a joke about it like he was you know you can be killed by a sword now he disappeared and won't got killed in car wreck about three days later but five days later it came out or to gone said\nIn a Turkish newspaper that turkey should be leading Islamic world which has been his assertion\nRight and this is just a way to weasel in and reduce NBS is\nA prestige and his father ...\nBut he has a ... he he's more he's more of a Sunni nation\nYes they're all they're all Sunni but they're just different factions of the Sunni cause where because the the ... or the keepers of mecca\nThat gives them priority above all other Muslims right well the Oregon would like to control mecca and the Temple Mount how how would they be able to do that well if a ... sir planted\nAnd uh there's a said the ... yes yeah and the Saudi royalty imploded eh eh\nHe can make the move where they would have to have somebody who is powerful so like one of the things that's been going on too\nIs Turkey's been trying to poach a lot of Saudi ally so recently they poach Kuwait out of the Saudi orbit\nNow that's been a long standing issue ever since after World War one when the Saudis burned them and took a bunch of their land because a relationship with the British right and also they believe the Kuwaitis are owed Eighteen billion dollars\nFor the joint oilfields they share a Saudi Arabia so there's been issues so but quite felt like\nI ... and when you bring that up it was it was Kuwait or in the disputed oil fields that was doing the horizontal drilling yes a underneath a border that prompted the invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf War in Nineteen Ninety One that\nWas the excuse right though there was a good reason [laughter] they should they should know\nBetter rather than to liberate in the medical students away that was Grenada\n[laughter] ah so this is a bold move by already gone uh are the Saudis that\nVulnerable well ... recently the ... uh in the midst of this big financial conference and because of ... murder and\nThe question is exactly how what did he finally died there were several variations now 'cause it's gone away from you got dissipated an asset to being chopped up to now they found some of the body parts\nA lot of the big financial people in the world is showed up one of the things that's been going on in the middle east and this is one of these things were Saudi Arabia is very vulnerable to swing into the Russian word it\nBut the king speaker at this financial a conference because a lot of American groups like J. P. Morgan and others didn't show up was the Russian be TB bank\nAnd he had speaker So Russia\nHas been warming Saudi Arabia planning on trying to sell it some military equipment that's probably one of the reasons why Trump is so adamant about a hundred billion in us a weapon sales that are already on tap drug that would be devastating to the U.S economy if that filters\nSo meanwhile ... a Saudi Arabia in Egypt recently had a joint military exercises and apparently there were some Russian observers they're Russia already has been getting very tight with Egypt and pretty much wooed Egypt out of the U. S. ...\nI remember we talked about that a couple of weeks ago uh now what about the Saudi response to a very\nEmbassy being bug and they haven't released\nOf the tapes merely and I'm doing air quotes transcripts of the tapes\nYes well they haven't really said much uh right now the Turkish intelligence police and the shaking down the\nSaudi consulates a home in other places I don't think they have any real video all they have is a audio\nNow or ... just going to come out with the real truth there shortly question is what is that real truth I don't think he even those\nI think they had some recordings because I've had too many ... other story as time goes on who has this out there to do the Turks the Turks okay but ... was it'd be us involved I have to believe so um apparently Eighteen of a intelligence officials are now um rounded up\nBut the fact main ones now dead really kind of that's Saudi tradition to get rid of the the main link\n[noise] well I I mean do you think it was a botched play or do you think it was somebody who tried to take admission is uh not really thinking through if it's for the moment a fiance sitting on the steps of the embassy waiting for his exit\nBlah blah blah well apparently there were seven calls me by Saudi intelligence right before\nThat happened to NBS I Believe it was NBS insulted and wanted him gone\nInto it and do they\nCompletely unacceptable in this peace loving brotherly world that we live in France not okay what happens Russia they just [noise]\nUh our rights are we still have more ground to cover our guest

figure out how to go on TV are see nine\nFifty Houston sounds good everywhere Alexa placate PR see on ... radio here oh buddy outlawed days with the very learned bill\nThis is Derek and day Thursday host of fit I heart radio podcast the twenty three and listen in and I chat with rather daring and check Chris the band computer game and New York times best selling author AJ Jay got about how we are all family like it or not the way that\nI define family is you know we are surrounded by people in our lives that we consider cousins and close close loved ones that are closer to us and the\nPower of the segment is called in Tel over watch a bill I Know uh we we close that last hour\nTalking about a Saudi Arabia and turkey\nOh we didn't really get into what's going on in Syria a and in Israel\nAnd Lebanon on and so on and so forth\nSo let's pull that scab off and talk about it\nWell guys are still occurring uh this last week the Israelis moved a lot of armor up along the Gaza border uh\nThey they're the fire balloons the fire kites everything you know ... and ... are still happening daily uh and it's really under reported but uh Israel's pretty much you know end of the day is a at it but in in the day\nTo Iran is supporting a lot of this effort so that's going on in Gaza with Hamas Hamas is a Sunni organization but they have always been tied with Iran because of their hatred of Israel\nUm and a couple of\nWeeks ago we had one of the uh the ministers of Iran and calling for the destruction of Israel it hadn't been vocalizing awhile a also we're looking\nAt a of the Israelis had dated and shoot\nDown but because of their deceptive whatever it was the the radar practices they got the Syrians to shoot down by the Russian planes and there was a stern warning from Russia this won't be tolerated more\nHow is all that played out all the escalation a with not only Russia but also Iran well uh two\nDays ago the Russian and Syrian any aircraft a radar network I turned on but no attacks occurred but the S. three hundred\nSystems have been delivered to Syria now are armed and before Syria and Russia kept their systems\nSeparate and they didn't have a link now serious systems are integrated into the Russian systems and all the way up to Moscow and their nuclear deterrents network so the right now ... controlled airspace into part of Israel from\nA from the bases they have they have about three hundred missiles ah so usually takes one to three to bring down a a aircraft if it's not at thirty five or something like that so they have the capabilities\nYou know\nPossibly unlimited twenty five percent of Israeli air force\nReally yes now a\nWhere does Iran fit into this I Know that they were instrumental in a in a certain period of the repulsion of ISIS in Syria but at a certain point there was sort of this requests for them to to vacate the country where do we end up with that\nWell and this is interesting we have the issue in it lip going as a a safe zone as a ... a and what's happened is turkey and Russia had developed this plan to create a buffer some some of the jihad groups won't give up their weapons\nBut what was interesting Iran was originally got help Syria what does it live issue because ... they're going to go into it lip\nAh Iran decide to sit out but now we're back on tap in the effort the question is because their motives are in sync with Turkey's motives because turkey wants that area too\nWhich side is Iran really going to do with um\nIran has continued as weapons shipments in with the Boeing plans we sold them of but there has been since yesterday hundreds no significant an Israeli attack taken him out a\nThere's a build up going on in in a loving on right now and\nOther interesting thing is they're still pockets of ISIS all up along the ah Iraqi Syrian border but it's the SDF is taking them out\nSo one of the threats now is that turkey wants to use the Euphrates me a bitch and all that plans to out of terrorists which are
