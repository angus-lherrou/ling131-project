talking about China earlier in reference to the trade wars going on a you talked about that you own a their currency being weak although being propped up uh that you referred to them as a paper dragon\nWell they have a lot of debt underlined or expansion and the thing that's been propping up\nTheir economy and allowing them to expand like they have has been the fact that they've been able to block us imports into their country charging terrorists\nAnd then being able to sell products over here Tara free so um they have inflated their economy now that we're starting to see the ripple effects some of the cracks and their financial foundation are starting to show a little bit there's been like\nAnd I think last a few weeks there's been a drop in the ... stock market market a higher than the ... Brazil Russia together [noise]\nAh so\n... Z. is being put in a position that he had to make a deal because\nThey are prepared if the people were willing to sacrifice their alarm trade war to probably win however in the meantime the people have gotten used to this great wealth because I made this huge leap from a bicycle to Mercedes right into this gradual work your way up like we have in America\nAnd they're starting to be a little bit of ripple effect or ... dissension and some of the provinces [noise]\nNo that's a good thing as a good thing for us [noise] uh what else goes on with China these days well a mini\nThings as their leaps and a I uh the probably the biggest thing I think it's a telling is the fact that we had to us worships soul sale between the straight to Taiwan mainland China started hundreds of miles wide international waters\nExtremely upset ... busy and the military there there were shattered by the Chinese that's when that hasn't been done and like many years\nIt was kind of an insult to Z and his\nMindset that that is their area and people shouldn't be going there and then not to in like the freedom of navigation operation a couple of weeks ago when us destroyer was outside the twelve my limit of what used to be there at that island and was chased off\nSo is are are going through a a slap in the face in response to their challenging to the freedom of navigation\nYeah the ... they take it as a major political insult and that they have already on this area and we need to back off\nBut meanwhile they're also ah ... trying to exert themselves not necessarily on the waters but also in five gee\nUh networks that's the coming thing and cell phone already there they have Chinese companies around the globe joined a bed for certain countries five jeez network\nA one on things that was interesting when Germany is are willing to lead Germany inspectors their software to make sure there's nothing that can be used against the Germans were used for spying but of course software can always be upgraded a\nAbout five ... as part of their uh one belt one road initiative to be able to control the flow and information and so what this allows cone activity anywhere on the earth eventually it's super high speeds knowing\nThat they were guilty of that back door or that they put in whatever that the the ... on there so knowing that that is the case how could any a modern\nNation in good conscience do business with them as it pertains to any sort of a sell your data transfer or anything that could be infringed upon hacked or a manipulated how would anybody in good conscience do business with they\nCan't get conscience little surprises right and this is not just a recent event with the a chip that was put in there before oh come all a start up before the operating system would pick up so that way the operating system wouldn't take it up\nOr the done this with putting back doors one's a hard drives and other that's been going on for a good Eighteen years\nAnd every time we stop a one way case in point with the cell phones issue with the uh uh the or the cell phones US Army bases ... uh yeah there are there are\nThere ways find another way around it fool me once shame on you\nAnd and then again it's kind of like what you said a while back you know these five gee networks all be controlled that as notes by artificial intelligence that's why I always keep going back to artificial intelligence ... said whoever controls and and when and say I wore will control and ruled the world\nAnd where is Russia as it pertains to that not as far as China but they are trying to develop their own AI but it's not going to be necessarily on the five gee networks of where we\nWell we were going to a ... we have some degree we're not to the point where China's actually working on a high human hybrid soldiers are they actually apparently has some cyborg itch type a candidates are ready to earn the of\nDevelopment so by the you'll buy in the future they look to see bill will control the battlefield for all these enhanced ... soldiers were working on her own but we're not as far DARPA has and and not quite as far as the Chinese can we do still there's technology\nWell that's the problem is they had built in a it's harder to get stuff out of China than it is out of the u._s.\nHastened point is how the hip blocked American access to the markets while we've opened up are at a markets and the case a like a Chinese Chinese investment us company they want a position on the board\nThere aren't people in the employees in the management\nHas calculated it smart it's a it's a multi dimensional chess game but with the potential failing of\nThe trade war on their part uh the fact that there is there there is some unrest in their country have they miscalculated the timeline\nAnd he he was a stringer for the Washington Post yeah and basically wrote a lot of anti saw them on a perspective pieces\nYes and also basically uh you know he's he appeared\nTo try to take the peaceful ground but in the background it was basically\nHe was again he he was into the Muslim Brotherhood and ... which I think this one of the reasons this outrage 'cause I'm looking at some of the poll politicians and other people who supported the Arab Spring which which is nothing but a Muslim Brotherhood operating operation take our country's\nSo he had ties to Saudi until apparently him aside and CIA and why\nDid the Turks go out of their way to a reveal their hand that they've bug the Saudi embassy and B why are they going out of the way to embarrass the Saudis what is already gone to play here\nWell about five days after the disappearance and there's this great video of the show you do in the moon walk backwards out of the Saudi consulate the Saudis is released it and made\nIt that joke he was doing there were just [laughter] ... well\nYeah and they even tried to get a body double in there but that didn't work out to imagine it's funny the main intelligence had there was one that operation I kind of made a joke about it like you can be killed by a sword now he disappeared one got killed in a car wreck about three days later but five days later it came out or non said\nIn a Turkish newspaper that turkey should be leading Islamic world which has been his assertion\nRight and this is just a way to weasel in and reduce\nNBS is a ... a siege but\nHe has a ... he he's more he's more of a Sunni nation\nYes the ... they're all Sunni but they're just different factions of the Sunni cars were because the the ... or the keepers of mecca\nThat gives them priority above all other Muslims right well in Oregon would like to control mecca end that supplemental how how would he be able to do that well if a ... planted\nAnd uh the say the as the Saudi king yes yeah and the Saudi royalty imploded eh eh\nHe can make the move where they would have to have somebody who is powerful so like one of the things that's been going on too is Turkey's been trying to poach a lot of Saudi allies so recently they poach Kuwait out of the Saudi orbit\nNow that's been a longstanding issue ever since after World War one when the Saudis burned them and took a bunch of their land because of the relationship with the British right and also they believe the Kuwaitis are owed Eighteen billion dollars for the joint oil fields they share a Saudi Arabia so there's been issues\nSo but quite felt like I ...\nAnd when you bring that up it was it was Kuwait or in the disputed oil fields that was doing the horizontal drilling yes a underneath a border that prompted the invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf War in Nineteen Ninety One that\nWas the excuse right though there was a good reason [laughter]\nThey should they should know better rather than to liberate in the medical students away that was grown out of\nA so this is a bold move by already gone uh are the Saudis that vulnerable well ... recently the\nAnd right in a in the midst of this big financial conference and because of ... murder\nAnd the question is exactly how what did he finally died there were several variations now 'cause it's gone away from you got dissipated an asset to being chopped up to now they found some of the body parts\nA lot of the big financial people in the world is showed up one of the things that's been going on in the middle east and this is one of these things were Saudi Arabia is very vulnerable swing into the Russian word it\nBut the king speaker at this financial a conference because a lot of American groups like J. P. Morgan and others didn't show up was the Russian be TB bank\nAnd if the speaker So Russia\nHas been warming Saudi Arabia planning on trying to sell it some military equipment that's probably one of the reasons why Trump is so adamant about a hundred billion in us a weapon sales that are already on tap right that would be devastating to the U.S economy if that filters\nSo meanwhile ... a Saudi Arabia in Egypt recently had a joint military exercises and apparently there were some Russian observers they're Russia already has been getting very tight with Egypt and pretty much wooed Egypt out of the U. S. ...\nYeah I remember we talked about that a couple of weeks ago uh now what about the Saudi response to a very\nEmbassy being bug and they haven't released copies of the tapes merely and I'm doing air quotes transcripts of the tapes\nYes well they haven't really said much uh right now the Turkish intelligence police shaking down the\nSaudi consulates a home in other places I don't think they have any real video all they have is a audio\nNow or ... just going to come out with the real truth there shortly question is what is that real truth I don't think he even knows\nI think they had some recordings because I've had too many more things other story as time goes on who has is out there to do the Turks that search okay but it was NBS involved\nI have to believe so um apparently Eighteen of a intelligence officials are now um rounded up but the fact main ones now dead really kind of a Saudi tradition get rid of the the main link\nWell I I mean do you think it was a botched play or do you think it was somebody's trying to take a mission is uh not really thinking through if it's for the moment a fiance sitting on the steps of the embassy waiting for his exit\nBlah blah blah well apparently there were seven calls me by Saudi intelligence right before that happened to NBS I Believe it was NBS insulted and wanted him gone\nInto they've\nCompletely unacceptable in this peace
