T. cube movement has decided that only\nMembers of the L GB T. Q. community should be allowed to play L G Beatty cute characters\nWhich is a bit insane\n\nShe said it speaks to something that I'm quite passionate about storytelling general but in films specifically\nIs it a film it can be quite literal medium and I will fight to the death of the right to suspend disbelief and play roles beyond my experience I think reality television and all that entails is at an extraordinary impact a profound impact on the way we view the creation of a character\nI think it provides a lot of opportunity but the downside of is that we now particularly in America I think we expected only expect people to make a profound connection to a character when it's close to their experience\nThat's a fancy way of saying\n\nThat you want to be an actor because you like acting you know what a lot of people including women have played Peter Pan on Broadway\nNone of them are magical children from a different land acting\nIs about pretending to be someone else about and pretending to have experiences us so we got a point where only serial killers could play serial killers whoa whoa whoa if you haven't butchered someone\nCan't play but butcher\nNo it's

just trying to run the government doesn't need to be a little bedrooms I don't care how people live on who we want to sleep with\nBusiness as long as they're not victimizing someone I don't care what would be your own life living in poverty you want\nBut trying to bully Hollywood which is crazy because Hollywood loves you know into\nOnly hiring certain types of people for certain types of roles is absolutely disgusting\nAnd I just wanted to get that out there but I Do want to talk you know we we've heard all of this nonsense we've seen it\nI mean we've seen it a little bit on the right to receive some wrestle some Proud Boys is Kevin Kevin says Gruber Gavin I openly advocated for violence not in response to violence will just to\nBe violent but clearly this started with MTV from the left can we hear a clip of a member of a political consultant bill appraise worked for Hillary Clinton do we hear a clip of him saying oh it's okay and rationalizing normalizing of police Chris\nSitting there and he's thinking a couple of things first of all I have Capitol police that are ten feet away or to thinking I got my wife Elaine who is better than the capital place three thinking\nMerrick Garland you know verse my leftovers I mean he's getting away with murder and ... that I think is missing the working ... such a made up a problem ... again it is like ... it is the first amendment\nAnd there is a difference at and it goes to something ... said people are doing this because there is no other opportunity for no other opposite that over say\nThe Republican Congress has basically play field team to Donald Trump people are doing these things because it's all that's left and let's see what do they die they're denying Sarah Sanders for her ... her Cornish hen there

Party who is giving aid and comfort to the Proud Boys and two white national often they become the party of white nationalist and all of their hatred for bigger deal to me than someone not getting their suffer\nThat was Philip writes former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton as she while she served as the secretary of state\n\nQualifying he been he was talking I Hope you've got that he was talking about that Mitch McConnell restaurant incident were him and his wife was chow or Secretary Chao had their food throw\nWere accosted be normal laws now\nHe draws the line with people harassing Nancy blows it goes you know that's Nancy below zero and then you know that's them protecting and supported us the Republicans as supporting white nationalist wrapping their arms around\nThis is a lie fueled by the left and the mainstream media I think that I said seeing the you know this is actually that was a clip from MSNBC let's give credit where credit's due\n[noise]\nBut that's Philly Philip Phil\nRepeating it ...\nThe lie that justifies the violent frightening contact being director conduct being directed at public servants it's and so ... insane but not everyone shows you how short sighted the left is\nAs we've seen with the riot with the Proud Boys the mal resulting interests this can easily get to where it goes both ways\nAnd let me tell you if I had to pick a side that I Would want to attack me I Want the whiny hippies attacking me not the lunatics on the ... the far right fringe right\nRight I mean but not the ... the crazy fall right Second Amendment guys I'd be much more frightened of them now I don't want any crazy people attacking anyone that's why I came as though you don't get much of his rhetoric examples ... ridiculous is disgusting\nBut he was a senior advisor to the secretary of state he wasn't the secular state herself justifying saying there shouldn't be no peace until they when the Democrats need to recall the what you'll get control is
