sources as possible and make the decisions to be discerning consumers of information\nOn our own at intel over watch All right bill uh we ... where do we start tonight well you know periodically you asked about what's\nGoing on Libya and what are we will journal half target has weapons\nWhen he's been getting them now really from the Russians right or\nThe Russians are moving in heavy hardware that built two bases Libya went into Iraq\nWould have been God's he moved in essence three hundred systems are basically the same one seemed versions that Syria now right\nAnd so along with that so what the big riots and clashes have been having Tripoli and other cities there's been a call for the UN to move in to bring peace fell from a from the combatants in Libya the citizens that are trying to find a peaceful solution\nTo a ... find a functional version of Libya\nHey if the UN steps him a that's a ... ball that includes of France Germany\nRussia whoever brings troops and even all the weight and it can be some North Korean troops\nIs necessarily a good thing for Libya not to have the UN in there because un never ...\nElite elite solves anything they just uh\nAre there but that goes back to your uh\nFirst quote of the evening when you're talking about Albert Einstein if we don't change our way of thinking\nAh the thinking that got us into our problems as we look for solutions or we don't solve our problems\nExactly exactly and then it's going to be have to be a totally different kind of thinking but a ... hour after hour has been very a pivotal in eliminating a lot of the ISIS threat that but still isn't the dry and uh so now with this hardware those this allows Russia\nBecause this is one of the big developments to what their caliber missiles than our fully operational from small boats to their submarines and they have up to Fifteen hundred mile range Ghouta\n... Russia okay and so they're putting this on bases where they can cover huge areas out into the Mediterranean [noise] ah and also\nThe show this strategically a a a presence in Libya is very important for them\nRight and as Ridley talked a while back at that put connecting the dots and extend those dots out so he's got one die in Syria you can leap frog over Libya right now or Tunisia is starting to have\nThe rise of the jihad cells they're having their mass migration and there's already some feelers out there but some of the marks from Russia's Wagner Group\nOver there in Tunisia Tunisia uh does Russia have any other president in the Mediterranean\nI yes and uh in Egypt right now and they've been selling a lot of a high tech and the new version of fighters make thirty ones as she thirty five to Egypt or in Russia has done quite a bit of training with us sees these troops\nOr Egypt Egypt half or so in the game of risk or the Russians had been quietly doing very well very well and\nThat's the thing is and this is the argument I've had for the past Seventeen years of people ... is a different type of a Russian leader before a\nThe patients wasn't there with shootings or the exhibits patients in coolness when before let's say ... and drop off or whoever would have ... you know throwing down a too quickly I\nThink it's because of a ... background and the KGB understand the long game\nWell here's the thing is you know he ... he was such a nondescript\nKGB or agent man when\nHe was in Dresden and stuff like that the latter off for some reason found something that has been coaching him so he's had two meant mentors that have guided him to transcend just be in an average KGB agent uh\n... it is a big picture is a long game extremely and he's been very upfront what it's all about uh what else as we talk about Russia [noise] okay well uh\nNow for the fact of mental launched the missiles their calorie muscles other submarines and everything and one of the things I've been talking about for a while is the fact that NATO doesn't have that many ports for a let's say for us to come to the rescue but now Russia with their suburbs\nNow can shut down any port within range with their submarines they don't have to go out to Iceland they don't have any place they can go watch from a far distance now still fully\nThe geo gap there by Iceland is no longer a factor because they don't have to go out and ... they can stay clear on the east side of Iceland and watch\nBecause of the the expansion of their a rage to be able to hit targets\nIt accurately which is up to the ... and so they over the ocean they skim about sixty five feet overland about a hundred Ninety two about close to five hundred feet wasn't\nThere some conversation uh in the last couple of weeks about the U.S are creating a an extreme military operations an extreme show of force\nAh for the Chinese and I guess the Russians and the rest of the world\nYes and we uh we had the incident but we have yet to really put something together because basically per the conversation from uh the China's foreign minister to pump pay you\nGet back off back off where South China back off in the south China Sea is back off on your trade sanctions and back off in the south China Sea so about a week ago we had an incident where a a U.S destroyer was doing and freedom of navigation up\nBy one the ... and the destroyer if the ... would have collided Chinese ... with the U.S destroyer if it had not cat made so they got within a hundred and forty five feet the\nChinese did right it would it would there would have been a collection at the U.S destroyer hit ... oh so we we were they play chicken and we'd chicken right you know it's about time to bring out the grappling hooks or a pirate reference if you are a so\nIs there anti marriage or currency to be a curated\nFrom a massive military operation a to flex our muscles is\nThere is there a military hardware technology that we haven't revealed to the world at large that could\nSomehow a re establish dominance or not\n... ... a\nPretty much and here's one of the things dynamics that happened last three weeks is\nThe fact that now that China with we've been talking about their quantum satellite technology and everything and build a ... attack us submarines now they're incorporating laser with their satellites to build a spot subs down to extremely deep ... who is trying\nTo Chinese or creating the laser technology ah for submarine hunters\nRight so they're expanding it and that's the number one threat to China is our us a ... now what about the Russians up well there are upgrading\nTheirs and a two and but the thing is about the uh and\nRight now Russia has been focusing on there a barren see Baltic Fleet mhm uh upgrades that have just put another one out there so now that has six kilos classes that are coming out of ...\nWe've been trying to prevent a or slow down the the progressive Nordstrom too\nYes we have and that's one of the things with some of these sanctions on one on last time when a Trump was a poll and he was trying to do some deals for American Ellen gee being transported which would be more expensive uh by about three or more than double the cost you know for Europe\nIt's doable but the main thing here is you can see what's happening with the chess game or with Ukraine in Poland and with the winning a stone in um [noise]\nThat as they are going to be cut off they're going to be at the mercy more of Russia for their supplies in the\nWinter ... Russia a slowly a strengthening their grip on eastern and Western Europe or through their control of resources are and meanwhile a Western Europe is combating a an immigration problem in economic problem and cohesion of the European Union\nExactly and and then right now the European Union is turning out to be maybe hunting dumped the very same because the fractures are getting worse and worse and worse especially with Italy ah financially and also the revolt against the immigration quotas\nWell Italy is certainly suffered more than many of the European Union members with the responsibility and intake of refugees landed on their shores\nRight and also the great cultural change or after France or the number one country where a former cathedrals are being turned into moss yeah\nAnd and and let me just clarify when we say that it's not like the Muslims are coming in a concrete and taking over\nThese churches cathedrals a monasteries they are being sold\nTheir very and sold and it's filling a vacuum\nBasically yes they are being sold there's very low church a church attendance and so as Europe has lost some of its roots good or bad for whichever one viewpoint or looking at you're seeing this transition come in and uh art work that's been around for hundreds of years has gone\nWell I'm so and that's that's the crime a that these antiquities are being destroyed a and and certainly a\nEmotionally it tugs at one what is the overall condition and status of Europe right now I Know you like to refer to as years than\nWell it it's a if you look at seeing what's happening in Sweden and Netherlands uh with the moves there you can definitely see the change a turning away now some people are saying and maybe it's two generations away before it's totally changed uh\nEurope as a whole I probably agree with the parts will be the next Twenty years forever changed and so there's even talk and France about eventually being a civil war there's been talk of Italy being as or over the migrant issue\nBut the number one change in the armor right now is the financial condition of your and that's probably one of the reasons why Merkel was pushing this pipeline deal through willing to do sanctions will buy a bypass the sanctions with Iran and set up another financial vehicle\nYeah but this is this is the same as the leader of this advanced industrialized modern nation that has miscalculated on a number of occasions\nUm well intended to be it's allegedly a decision that she sought to remedy a current uh situations physically basically within her nation\nOf it have had a cultural impact and in the end of fiscal impact a first it was the inclusion of the the refugees to bolster their labor force an to put money in their coffers are for their aging population\nNow uh trying to get cheap energy at the cost of patronage of the former Soviet Union a beef seem to be credible missteps\nA misguided and miscalculated on her part without any checks and balances from her government or a populous\nOr she's a key GB sleeper agents for ... days [noise] yes I Know you like to advance that idea feathers great pitcher rented a there was a telling pitcher you know back in the fifties as a pitcher of may a Merkel and the current CIA director on the same couch\nSo some of the rhetoric of comes and I'm not you know a sign that left or right left a that comes out of Europe and from the global as and they say it is Europe's responsibility as humanitarians\nTo accept the refugees because the habits that has been wrecked on North Africa in the middle east is really\nA an outgrowth of the failed colonization of of that part of the world and therefore the strife or the carnage the death the destruction the lack of a stability\nIs in effect not only a they're human responsibility but also but logistically their responsibility what would you say to that\nThey don't know their history before the colonial colonial period because if you look at all these areas that have been big war zones for thousands of years case in point you know from Egypt to Syria ... over that area for four hundred years back and forth from turkey to Egypt back and forth and it's been going on I mean just century\nAfter century it's always different it's nothing that why why has this divisiveness\nA persisted why haven't the inhabitants intellectually evolved and civically a progressed to where we're not looking at you know multigenerational uh\nWell I don't think there's been long enough of current if ... if you look at Greece the huge explosion and extrapolate ... knowledge that occurred during a peaceful times but a lot of it got lost during the wars that started happening later periods in\nThese areas just never have had long enough period of peace except through an autocratic a spot who was to Iran uncles [noise]\nSo you know if you speak too much peace you know a or something contrary to what the ... for the uh ... says you know you don't have much of a voice for ... or\nSo it's the entrenched powers faults are not a popular is our guest is bill Powell was submitted until over watch we continue our circuit medication or the globe coming up next

China well\nWe can either start with the tech arena or in talk with the social unrest agenda oh let's start with social address well one of the problems we're having a giant ... and that is the fact a lot of that's been wanting to get their pensions and habit\nSo recently a group went to Beijing to protest and they came back to their home town and the police were there to beat them up\nThese are military veterans or military veterans went to Beijing to demand their pensions and upon returning home were beaten up by the uh ... haven't voice yes how does how does one rationalize I guess in that ... government this matter what you do\nWell because you know dissent is not acceptable regardless of the reason and we have to remember not that long ago well about eighty plus years ago with the America had its own situation like that\nWhere we beat up the military veterans swelled\nThe veterans back in Nineteen thirty two weren't getting their pension and they were camped outside of Washington DC McArthur in low calorie came in Iran I'm off\nReally oh so ah the the first person with a out and he said cast the first uh\nWell that's the whole thing we need to analyze history objectively not obviously Kate eliminate facts and look at it but we have gone through cycles and uh how and of course there were tight economic times but there were still away for the pensions to be paid to these fats because that was a promise of his maid and\nThe Chinese you're talking about uh I'm Talking about the U.S in whoever\nIt is an interesting how\nUh even though we do try to learn from our mistakes and grow morally and intellectually or any time that we object to someone else's immoral or a moral behavior they are quick to throw back in our face or something from our past kind of like an angry ...\nWife yeah something like that but here's the thing is when the you know us like that old phrase don't worry about this back in your brothers I worry about that being in your own eyes if and that's one of those things you got can't use the same thinking gash in the situation to get you out of it ah\nThe objectivity and admitting the past and making the future right is should be the game plan\nWhich logistically expedient isn't always morally desirable just ask Google and [noise]\nUh all writes ah ... let's talk about the ... situation in\nChina well of course you know a

out was a quickly a devoted or a given dishonorable discharge why do you think that is a because nobody wanted to point out the emperor has no clothes [noise]\nYeah but why does why does a maverick like Trump come in and point out something that's patently obvious uh and then he gets dismissed with an I roll more more nationalism more protectionism more irrational reaction to the balance of
