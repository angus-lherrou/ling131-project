I'm Sorry people should not sweat Mick was lying ... a Ford is having some sort of suppress memory nonsense her story is falling apart mirrors I think it's the most credible what there was a possibility that he got drunk whipped it out\nBut you know what we all did a bunch of ignorance stuff in college and I'm Sorry that that happened to her\nBut I don't think it should disqualify him thirty some years later after life in public service\nBut plus ... let's move on to nine eleven so what are your thoughts on nine eleven was ...\nWell you know we needed more we need more security we needed more intelligence gathering here and the state to prevent something like that from happening I mean it's my belief that our intelligence community already knew that something was cooking up over there and what was going to happen\nMaybe they didn't know but I Believe they did a you know I don't think especially I mean\nTwo planes into buildings you know how do you get into buildings setting in but I mean I think that that was the perfect catalyst for them to come in and start grabbing power with the with the Patriot act\nFor the government turned a blind eye to that tragedy or just a shoulder to it because it would be a mechanism for expansion of governmental power and authority\nOh yeah I really [noise] yeah you were like you think the world where the\nDeep state was aware and they let it happen because it was the vehicle by which they do have more more\nControl over the American population\nVery good at the deep state I mean the yeah I mean I I mean I kind of become come to believe that at the ... in the right I mean they're uh they're they're the same thing that same mechanism there and I you know I I put fascism communism as far as\nGoing to the right now you gradually getting less and less government you get a full on anarchy which I've come to become a proponent for the later years of my life\nBut as they enter you mean just anyone doing anything to anybody and there's no control I see just protect yourself with your own guns there is no police there is no fire there's no schools\nWhere you can get into an architect and our cynical but I mean at this point I don't get any man should be in control of anyone else I mean I think that record shows that it can be done with the abuse that you see you know going on in in historic regimes and even ... even today I was you know what's going on with\nWith what's going on with what going to cut you off her place\nI mean the nanny state you know I mean okay they want I mean look what's going on in the streets okay a military operation at the police force\nRight but you don't look so when you served did you serve in Iraq or Afghanistan or both\nOh I get all the time and that and say okay\nAnd did this just cynicism or is is that that is is\nDownstream as a reaction to your service or is this something you brought with you into the service or I Need to call cynicism or is this this this divergent viewpoints for mainstream America when did this when did you adopt this was before your service or after your service\nBeliefs going in\nBut I really kind of came to this day I Would not any conspiracy theories I Believe that nine eleven happened exactly the way to be a you know nine eleven condition landed on out right now you know I guess about the time is Sandy Hook and I believe I'm not saying I don't believe any ... in ... and I don't I I Believe that people\nNow yeah I Can't tolerate ... no families that lost their children\nThere I think I Know the crisis actor nonsense is just not what I'm Talking about that's ridiculous\nI Alex Jones or the ... will have been\nOr get a good word to you but you know we've got we've only got about two minutes for up to show 'em\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat led you to serve though I think that I mean I Know you're you're of all on your positions and you become more ... in your ... your your thought but what what was the ... the motivation the genesis or your decision to go sign up and serve your country\nWhen I heard that they sent you to Thailand\nWell that's about his article of ever\nHeard me I wanted to get into and I have a lot of respect for veterans you know the the ... you know there is probably a little external motivation after the state of Texas\nRight okay\nUm and we've got a chuckle Andrew referee apologist from laughing at the gas but we've got a good time talking of Bobby I Do think Kavanaugh\nWill get confirmed I Believe it will I Do think that that is a reporter you know the Democrats are moving the goalposts right now was you know now Booker says he doesn't care if he's guilty or innocent\nBlumenthal says the if if the FBI who they've been they've been be added to find the FBI from Russia but now they're criticizing the FBI and so that if the FBI doesn't differ to their selection of witnesses to be\nInterviewed it's not about investigation which I reached doing a\nScene at the end after\nEvery mass shooting they're like oh oh yeah we ... we were watching that guy we we we we have to tell us we heard about him that FBI\nWill be able to that is and I'm not surprised by your

that truly love appreciate\nUh and and cherish um live music and all of the danger that goes into playing live and I say danger not in the\nGetting your head cut off or your legs broken kind of danger but when you're performing live everything from equipment failure to your voice cracking to slipping on the floor you know it's dangerous to fly and that's what makes it fun and exciting it's it's a roller coaster ride\nOf emotion every night even when you've been doing it for a long time\nAnd there are people that are truly the friends of uh\nAnd I've been very fortunate in various incarnations

they love it and they need it\nAnd in Houston one of the um\nOne of the truest friends of music is a is a lady named Terri el Thompson\nWho not only as a a a singer songwriter and her own regards but who spends hours every single day on every single form you can think of promoting\nUm [noise] you know the other bands every jam in town every day of the week an open Mike live music gigs Venus people
