to tonight well you know\nPeriodically you ask about what's going on Libya and what are we will journal half target has weapons when he's been getting them now really for the Russians\nAre the Russians are moving in heavy hardware that built two bases Libya went into Iraq\nWould have been God's he moved in essence three hundred systems are basically the same one seemed versions that Syria now right\nAnd so along with that so with the big riots and clashes have been in Tripoli and other cities there's been a call for the UN to move in to bring peace fell from a from the combatants and Libya the citizens that are trying to find a peaceful solution\nTo a fight to find a functional version of Libya [noise]\nHey if the UN steps him a ... ball\nThat includes of France Germany Russia whoever brings troops and even all the weight and it can be some North Korean troops fizz is necessarily a good thing for Libya not to have the UN in there because un never really totally solves anything they just uh\nAre there but that goes back to your uh\nFirst quote of the evening when you're talking about Albert Einstein if we don't change our way of thinking ah the thinking that\nGot us into our problems as we look for solutions or we don't solve our problems\nExactly exactly and it's going to be have to be a totally different kind of thinking but ... withdrawal half hour after hour has been very a pivotal in eliminating a lot of the ISIS threat that but still is in the rye and uh so now with this hardware those this allows Russia\nBecause it was one of the big developments to what their caliber missiles than our fully operational from small boats to their submarines and they have up to Fifteen hundred mile range who does Russia okay and so they're putting this and bases worthy\nUncovers huge areas out into the Mediterranean [noise] ah and also\nThe show this strategically a a a presence in Libya is very important for them\nRight and as rigidly talked a while back at that put connecting those dots and extend those dots out so he's got one die in Syria you can leap frog over to Libya right now or Tunisia is starting to have\nThe rise of the jihad cells they're having their mass migration and there's already some feelers out there but some of the marks from Russia's Wagner Group over there\nIn Tunisia Tunisia uh does Russia have any other president in the Mediterranean\nI yes and uh in Egypt right now and have been selling a lot of a high tech than a new version of fighters make thirty once as she thirty five to Egypt or in Russia has done quite a bit of training with a sees these troops\nOr Egypt Egypt half or so in the game of risk or the Russians have been quietly doing very well very\nWell and that's the thing is and this is the argument I've had for the past Seventeen years of people\n... is a different type of a Russian leader before a the patients wasn't there\nWith shootings or the exhibits patients in coolness when before let's say ... and drop off or whoever would have been ... you know throwing down a too quickly\n... think it's because of a ... background and the KGB understand the long game well\nHere's the thing is you know he ... he was such a nondescript\nKGB or agent man when\nHe was in Dresden and stuff like that but ... for some reason found something and it's been coaching him so he's had two meant mentors than A Guided them to transcend just be in an average KGB agent\nUh ... it is a big picture is a long game extremely and he's been very upfront what it's all about uh what else as we talk about Russia [noise] okay well uh\nNow for the fact of mental launch the missiles their calorie missiles out of their submarines and everything and one of the things I've been talking about for a while is the fact that NATO doesn't have that many ports for a let's say for us to come to the rescue but now Russia with their suburbs\nNow ... are shut down any pork within range with their submarines they don't have to go out to Iceland they don't have to go to the place they can go watch from a far distance now still fully\nThe geo gap there by Iceland is no longer a factor because they don't have to go out and suddenly and if they can stay clear on the east side of Iceland and watch\nBecause of the the expansion of their a rage to be able to hit targets\nIt accurately which is up to the part of her ... and so they over the ocean they skim about sixty five feet overland about a hundred and Ninety two about close to five hundred feet\nWasn't there some conversation uh in the last couple of weeks about the U.S are creating a an extreme military operation of an extreme show of force\nUh for the Chinese and I guess the Russians and the rest of the world\nYes and we uh we had the incident what we have yet to really put something together because basically per the\nConversation from uh the China's foreign minister to pump pay you\nGet back off backup where South China back off in the south China Sea us back off on your trade sanctions and back off in the south China Sea so about a week ago we had an incident where a a U.S destroyer was doing it in freedom of navigation up\nBy one the ... and the destroyer if the ... would have collided Chinese ... collided with the U.S destroyer if it had not cat made so they got within a hundred and forty five feet the\nChinese did right it would it would there would have been a collection at the U.S destroyer hit enter oh so we we were they play chicken and we'd chicken right you know it's about time to bring out the rally ... a\nA pirate reference if you are a so is there any merit or currency to be a curated\nFrom a massive military operation a to flex our muscles\nIs there is there a military hardware technology that we haven't revealed to the world at large that could\nSomehow ah reestablish our dominance or not\n... ... a\nPretty much and here's one of the things dynamics that happened last three weeks is the fact that now that China with women talk about their quantum satellite technology and everything and build a ... attack us submarines now they're incorporating laser with their satellites to build a spot subs down to extremely deep debt to is China\nThe Chinese are creating the laser technology ah for submarine hunters\nRight so they're expanding the that's the number one threat to China is our us ... now what about the Russians up well there are upgrading theirs\nAnd a two and but the thing is about the uh and\nRight now Russia has been focusing on their parents see Baltic Fleet mhm uh upgrades that have just put another one out there so now that has six kilos classes that are coming out of ...\nAh so ah\nBut the big development was suffering technology is the fact the Chinese to develop a ceramic coating that is very hard to ... [noise]\nUh and if they're developing it can't we assume that other entities are developing it also\nWell yes we can but for ... their way ahead of us on it and uh I Know they still need a military technology with the Russians yes they are in a limited basis or full disclosure well they've gone to the point where before they had to depend on the Russians for building the that they would have the\nIs you can see what's happening with the chess game a whiff Ukraine in Poland and Lithuania Estonia I'm [noise] that as they are going to be cut off they're going to be at the mercy more of Russia for their supplies in the winter\nSo Russia a slowly a strengthening their grip on eastern and Western Europe through their control of resources are and meanwhile a Western Europe is combating a an immigration problem in economic problematic cohesion of the European Union\nExactly and and then right now the European Union is turning out to me maybe hunting dumped the very same because the fractures are getting worse and worse and worse especially with Italy ah financially and also the revolt against the immigration quotas\nWell Italy is certainly suffered more than many of the European Union members with the responsibility and intake of refugees landed on their shores\nRight and also the great cultural change or after France or the number one country we're a former cathedrals are being turned into moss yeah and\nAnd and let me just clarify when we say that it's not like the Muslims are coming in a concrete and taking over\nThese churches cathedrals a monasteries they are being sold\nThe very end sold it ends filling a vacuum\nBasically yes they're being told there's very low ... a church attendance and so as Europe has lost some of its roots good or bad for whichever with viewpoint or looking at you're seeing this transition come in and uh art work that's been around for hundreds of years has gone well\nAnd so and that's that's the crime\nA that these antiquities are being destroyed a and and certainly a\nEmotionally it tugs at one what is the overall condition and status of Europe right now I Know you like to refer to it if you're a stand\nWell it's a if you look at seeing what's happening in Sweden and Netherlands uh with the moves there you can definitely see the change a turning away\nNow some people are saying and maybe it's two generations away before it's totally changed uh Europe as a whole I probably agree with the parks will be the next Twenty years forever changed and so there is even talk and France about eventually being a civil war there's been talk of Italy being as or over the migrant issue\nBut the number one sheen can the armor right now is the financial condition of your and that's probably one of the reasons why Merkel was pushing this pipeline deal through willing to do sanction for ... a bypass the sanctions with Iran and set up another financial vehicle yeah but this is this is the same\nAs a leader of this advanced ... modern nation that has miscalculated on a number of occasions\nUm well intended obey it's allegedly a decision that she saw to remedy a current uh situations physically basically within her nation\nOf it have had a cultural impact and in the end of fiscal impact of first it was the inclusion of the the refugees to bolster their labor force an put money in their coffers are for their aging population\nNow uh trying to get the cheap energy at the cost of patronage of the former Soviet Union a beef seem to be credible missteps\nA misguided miscalculated on her part without any checks and balances from her government or a populous\nOr she's a KGB sleeper agents for ... days [noise] yes I Know you like to advance that idea that there's great pitcher of it or there was a telling pitcher you know back in the fifties as a pitcher of may ... and the current CIA director owns St couch\nSo some of the rhetoric a comes and I'm not you know a sign that left or right left a that comes out of Europe and from the global as they say it is Europe's responsibility as humanitarians\nTo accept the refugees because the habits that has been wrecked on North Africa in the middle east is really\nA an outgrowth of the failed colonization of of that part of the world and therefore the strife or the carnage the death the destruction the lack of stability\nIs in effect not only a they're human responsibility but also a logistically their responsibility ... what would you say to that uh they don't know their history\nBefore all the colonial colonial period because if you look at all these areas that have been big war zones for thousands of years case in point you know from Egypt to Syria ... solution spot over that area for four hundred years back and forth from turkey to Egypt back and forth\nAnd it's been going on I mean just century after century it's always a different\nIt's nothing they've why why has\nThis divisiveness a persisted or why haven't the inhabitants ah intellectually involved and civically\nA progressed to where we're not looking at you know multigenerational a\n... well I don't think there's been long enough of a period piece if you look at ... the huge explosion and extra Appalachian the knowledge that occurred during the peaceful times but a lot of it got lost during the wars that started happening later periods and\nThese areas just never have had long enough period of peace except through an autocratic death spot who was Tyrone Nichols [noise]\nSo you know if you speak too much peace you know uh\nWe're something contrary to what the
