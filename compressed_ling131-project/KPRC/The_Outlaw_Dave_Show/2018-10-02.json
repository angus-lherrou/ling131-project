suckers that believe that they could take some online class and have a great career from some nonsense online degree and the federal government should have never guaranteed student loans for those kind of every year for any for profit institution\nThat was at a vocational school or a trade school that would allow someone to actually have a job but then how do you differentiate that well maybe you just allow the market itself to define you know you need Pell Grants and solutions but that should all be merit based\nThe suggestion that people should just be able to get free free free\nMeans that people won't appreciate I Do think education is paramount it's allowed for all my financial success\nBut I had to work for it and we should all have to work for it in less just offering\nFree

black or you're white or your Spanish or your your family status all these things you can see curry course both federally at the federal and state level\nThere is civil consequences but if you're a homosexual in Texas they fire you for being gay they can I think we I think people on the right bean to evolve pass a show I think a great number of people in the right have a law passed that issue\nIt's just a litmus test for many people so it's not address the reality is it's my understanding that Ted Cruz's was hairdresser is gay um that he doesn't have any issue with homosexuality on a

but he was talking about the foster care system in gay couples of building there's no evidence suggests there's more pedophilia among so sexual says are heterosexuals\nI think if there are kids that
