families\nAnd you know you're probably going to go deeper you're probably going to pierce the coverage and they have to give some money beyond but you would think that you would figure out a way to compensate these people for this horrible tragedy\n\nTo realize until you've been wrong like in Texas [noise] everyone in two thousand I think five gone on this great train of hey let's put it in caps on non economic damage\nIt was for medical malpractice and basically this was a a constitutional amendment designed by the industry to protect mostly nursing homes and hospitals from litigation but his real results as do paradigm in Texas where\nIf you are horribly injured by a doctor or hospital but most especially in nursing home where your elderly and you don't have the economic damages\nYou can't get any justice lawyers can't afford to be involved and you think you have a fix it really fix nothing it wasn't tied to inflation\nThere was just this wrong visited the purchased by the industry and consumed by voters who did not educate themselves enough on the issue I'm I'm not saying I'm anti\nTort reform I think you bring a fraudulent suit or ... which a lot of lawyers are doing that you shift the shifting like we saw in stormy Daniels' work cost shift not just to the climate possibly the lawyer ride it floors involved and bring false suits all the time\nBut to put these castle I was just cribs situation where there's no justice and they never shocked by what lawyers will sing too but I was actually shocked about this filing and this is what I'm Talking about this month's later is just this week lawyers for the company\nFiled a motion seeking to dismiss the claims\nClaiming that their liability was zero based on Eighteen fifty one maritime law it's PTA hundred and fifty one\nThat says because the vessel was a total loss and has no current value that means you know it's a song it was destroyed in his valueless and no fry was Pentagon the vessel the owners of the vessel have zero liabilities the passengers\n[noise]\nSince ... tea is lawyer responded those cows calculated replaces legal claim that my husband and children are worthless to respond herself is incredibly hard for the insensitive anyone who cares about people has any human decency should boycott Ripley and their attractions\nSo that's like the ... when they are not on that said yes Ripley entertain the why isn't there some of that is well I only boycott Starbucks than a well\nBecause you know the new one manager in one place back to their appropriately with some people that want to

American guy get into his apartment\nThat's horrible right and she's a racist or she should be called up but there are a lot of people raped and attacked and murdered yesterday as well right and we're not talking about those people were only talking about stuff that on flame the national rhetoric\nSay every once in a racist and get clicks right um yeah the the evil woman that it made the little African American get crime New York because he said she said it touched your bus last week right how's everything right but do we know that was about race I mean could just be that she was crazy and she's a crazy woman he was in ... right\nRight it was just any kid but nonetheless disgusting but why is that line of anybody who's going to be mean to a kid well they're crying and like we live that kid was completely innocent\nBut why is that more news than murders I don't know why is that more news than this company\n\nTrying to instead of taking ownership of the liability their lawyers are trying\nTo force this case into a nuisance value settlement\nAnd it's absolutely disgusting\n[noise]\nThey're referring to the ship owners limitation of liability act which limits damages to salvage value of the sunken vessel but you've heard of big giant ship that doesn't matter 'cause salvage values huge right but this is a little bitty duck boat\nWell I remember when it happened they were saying there's something wrong with a ... percent\nRight the law was intended to bolster fledgling maritime shipping industry Congress was trying to encourage people to buy vessels improve the maritime system this was Eighteen fifty one there was no insurance for maritime vessels\nWere two centuries later almost it's disgusting it's pretty outfits it's awful and\nYou know that's the thing in America is nobody wants to know about it but a lot of people and a lot of companies\nHave no desire to take responsibility for their mouth is I think lawyers are to blame to ride like I think it cuts both ways and most lawyers won't admit it I think that there are lawyers out they're falling frivolous nonsense suits left and right\nSo it puts a lot of people would have a lot of companies in a position where they have to treat every lawsuit like Israel is like I Am telling people I tell them I've for every lawsuit that I file in my in my civil litigation practice\nI've probably told nine other people that I don't think they're sued is something that I Would pursue a or that it's worth pursuing\nRight I'm I'll tell him to go get a second opinion I concede that I'm wrong but it's just

unrest agenda\nOh let's start with social address well one of the problems we're having in China and that is the fact a lot of that's been wanting to get their pensions and have it so recently a group went to Beijing to protest and they came back to their home town and the police were there to\nBe about these are military veterans or military veterans went to Beijing to demand their pensions and\nUpon returning home were beaten up by the uh ... you have a voice yes how does how does one rationalize I guess in a hotel it's very government there's no matter what you do\nWell because you know dissent is not acceptable regardless of the reason and we have to remember not that long ago well about eighty plus years ago with the America had its own situation like that\nWhere we beat up the military veterans swelled\nThe veterans back in Nineteen thirty to work in the kitchen and they were camped outside of Washington DC and MacArthur in low calorie came in Iran I'm off\nReally oh so ah the the first person with a out and he said cast the first uh\nWell that's the whole thing we need to analyze history objectively not obviously Kate eliminate facts and look at it but we have gone through cycles and uh how and of course there were tight economic times but there were still a way for the pensions to be paid to these fats because that was a promise of his maid and\nThe Chinese you're talking about uh I'm Talking about the u._s. and whoever\nIs an interesting how\nUh even though we do try to learn from our mistakes and grow morally and intellectually or any time that we object to someone else's immoral or a moral behavior they're quick to throw back in our face or something from our past kind of like an angry ...\nWife yeah something like that but here's the thing is when the you know us like that all phrase don't worry about the spec and your brothers I worry about that being in your own eyes if and that's one of those things you got can't use the same thinking gash in the situation to get you out of it ah\nThe objectivity and admitting the past and making the future right\nIs should be the game plan what's the logistically expedient isn't always morally
