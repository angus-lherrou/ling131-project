learned a lot from him and I still do on his Twitter it's really funny\nHe had a bit once and he said that once you get elected president they sit you in a room and they go congratulations\n... has no was it bill Hicks had a thing where like you would advise ugly you walk he basically you walk in we can find it probably knows but for what is the deal Hicks or wasn't bill Hicks says the thing we basically\nAnd I have to use it act like I'm smoking a cigarette because that's how bill Hicks was ensure you walk in after your elected president and you have like all these crazy ideas and all these things are going to do\nAnd then you walk into a room and there's a guy shadowy guy in the corner any hand you a folder he goes okay you want to do what now and\nYou go oh man I'm going to do this

over the past like two hundred years in America in the background story and why this had happened and why we had to do this and then it goes All right so what now what you want to do\nThat it seems like it's the same joke it's now the exact joke yeah the thing I was thinking that was that you get in the oval office you sit down and they congratulate you they pass you on the head ... then they hand you a folder\nYeah when you open the folder it shows you exactly what state of a re [laughter] 'cause then at that point in time versus what you thought it was in yeah because you never know the worse yeah exactly it's always worse so right that they're a secret service member watchers your entire psyche\nIt just crumbled [laughter] gone\nIt's like it's like a route from The Simpsons when when he leaves it doesn't like it that way and he just said no air and then and then\nYou emerged from the White House yeah and you wave to the people knowing full well there you go back to golf that the only way I see I didn't have is Gulf\nBecause the ... [laughter] as soon as you go back into that house it is yeah may hamper sucks again exactly that's why presidents golf and leave all the time basically ...\nTo that job that you hate yeah you're like

like I'm Marty excited about the the insanity in the ... of the city at that point because you can have people who are going to be complaining about traffic well the cops will be stopped in the side of the free out\nYou know that you're going to have great because you don't know trucks coming in ten because half the people don't pay attention they're all going to stop here there's a copier

he has to go to energy arena after he had promised that he was going to get the biggest stadium in Texas for this thing Dallas steady of yeah\nOr do they said Kyle Kyle Field would have been bigger oh instead of ATT yeah Eighteen the not Dallas so and I think Eighteen he can is eight is eighty thousand but they can convert it to one hundred thousand like they did for the super bowl\nBecause you can get ... people on the field yeah or something they can they can convert something in the pile field is has a pretty big thing but\nWhat I tried to break it down to people that it's also\nSo yeah we can make fun of him because he said he he we he over shot as coverage right if he was never going to get something that big\nOr he could just now legally be looking at it from a from a standpoint versus a logistical standpoint of there's no way we could do this is the president United States\nYou can't have him in a big giant open air thing that we not it'd be a nightmare yeah especially for a stop that's going to take maybe an hour maybe he may be here for an hour\nOr so I mean there was like there's those kind of logistics also he said this in August which is like two men two months out

and if you haven't already you have to check out our radios newest podcast twenty ... this is the show where we sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us\nThis week we got real with Melissa Etheridge has we discuss what does it mean to be family family's family and you can make family family's law that the bond\nWe um [noise]\nDo you ever done one of those genetic tests [noise]\nLike a twenty three and media know there were all talking about other sleep with was with one no I don't I don't want to know where\nI came from is that might be bad no no that's going to be said about that that was going to ask about that this week because\nI think that we ascribe too much of that uh-huh tourists like oh of course I'm of course I'm then when he does raise an I'm an ...\nYeah this is why I like to drink it's because I'm part Irish or there's something to that effect right I think we ascribe too much to that I think that we of course I Love corn that show I Am one Seventy fifth hundreds\nIndian exact Native American sorrowful law yeah of course I Love corn on the cob\nThat's just I've noticed that that's we that's the problem with these genetic tests is that it's cool to be curious and be like oh I didn't know that we have that in our background that's one thing but when you're like no\nI Am the one that Ninety nine thousand Indians so sorry Native American that I grew up in the nineties in the eighties guys I don't I don't know you know we had Cleveland Indians in Washington Redskins\nSo that was before in thing this week that we learned about the re found out that she was you know whatever percentage way way way way way way down the line I think it's made of American but possibly South American indigenous people I think it goes back to his long yeah\nLike we could have done this years ago yeah and I just think it's funny that the system has been rigged to where people can game it\nBy using things like that in their background to get more things right that makes sense absolutely like I understand you know I think you're fixing to go to an affirmative action ranch [laughter]\nNo like I it seems to me like those kinds of things you can see on the face you understand maybe you don't condone completely but you understand like I understand you know that there's you know for you know black kids and for Hispanic kids and even you know some white kids there's special\nUm scholarships you know for certain backgrounds I understand that mhm but I don't understand when you say that you are one teeny tiny little bit possibly indigenous that that means you are culturally diverse\nMaybe it's because that makes sense to college is so high that you need every advantage you can get fat that's been that's goes back to the system being rigged against the poor so that's what we'd go back to I guess is it rigged against the our borders that it's the same price for the rich\nYeah but I mean I guess the rich and really I have burned the money go wherever you want I don't know\nThat's the thing about rich people as I don't think of it like if when this this this a big lottery jackpot yeah I think it'd be pretty frugal with my money yeah I'm already for growing up as it is like twenty dollars right and I'm like oh yeah I'm going to put the candy bar back\nThen like every year that I like I'll explain that to like my mom and she's like\nYou can afford a candy bar and I'm just home for one of the same way yeah so it was Ninety nine when nine hundred and Ninety nine million close to a billion\nDollars I don't know what I think I Would have a guy by stuff for me I I Would have um I like a personal something no I Would have my money manager or my accountant and I'd say\nDo I have enough money I Know I Do yeah but do I have enough money to buy that floor of that building across the street and he would say yes you do and I'd say well can you get it for me to or he would say why\nHe would probably want somebody who would say well why well if I had four houses already yes absolutely invite him coming from my apartment\nI Want him to say that uh would you like it tomorrow okay yes I Would okay I was going to\nBe like five or six hours is like you said right his job should be like is the failsafe to be like\nNo exactly know slabs out of hand and I think I Would have to hire a dietitian because I Would immediately want to go to every cool I I wouldn't I Would go opposite no like I say like\nBecause I think being excited about food is sort of like when you grow up like lower middle class like bats and excitement thing right and so I think for me I Would be I'd want to divert from that and go the opposite and be like nope I'm only going to eat\nThings that we're prepared for me at home and I will always ... like I wouldn't be like oh what a Bob McDonald so I could have a McDonalds or whatever\nBut that's what I'm saying I Would have to have to hire a dietitian right on your way yeah because I Would want to do that because\nThe industry that we're in the people that we do the things that we do we always get to go to these great restaurants and I would love to pay it forward again that's good yeah I mean they do that for Charles do it for ... ... what do you do it for dinner tonight I Want to go to Georgia Jay ... yes yes and not to to talk to me uh\nI Would it would be no question I Would ... eats at the dumbest restaurants you've ever seen I Would have ... but if you had your nine hundred and\nNinety nine ... ... you have a billion dollars right the window if you win the the the mega million thing and you get like you know the cash value like six hundred or something sure you have enough money to where you don't need to ... breeds either\nOh right I don't have to work you can call them but I Would love to work you can call them sure I'd lie really say I could buy the restaurant you not even that like you could just walk in yeah\nLike you wouldn't be able to you would be that connected where you could just walk in on the busiest night of the week and be like hey and they'd be like\nGet the hell out of here James Harden well the thing that I eat well the thing is that people like Charles can do that now and he doesn't have that much I agree but I I I think it's a personality thing and I don't want to change",
