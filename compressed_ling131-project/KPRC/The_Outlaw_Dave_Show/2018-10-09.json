ratings and you know I think we all agree that white people that are racist are disgusting\nAnd here's the problem and I know the critical race theory argument that only white people because they're in power can be racist we've been hearing about all day it's Columbus Day we've been hearing about colonized ... evil we all are but here's the thing anyone\nThat thanks an ugly thing about someone

in San Francisco\nSo it's okay to use pejorative language directed at homosexuals if those homosexuals happened to be conservative Twitter is okay with that Twitter is okay with that target of harassment\nI don't know it's pretty disgusting\nWe all saw the video last week on through the University of Texas campus in my hometown Austin, Texas\n\nWhere students organize to support judge Kavanaugh\nAnd the fact that he was innocent until proven guilty and then they were attacked on video by other students who didn't believe that they had the right to speak other students report their signs got so close to their face screeching and yelling that they had to back down and walk away\nThey had to force the sake of their personal and bottle the integrity and their property because of the pitchforks and torches mob of the left we all saw the video\n\nOf our Senator Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi in Philly on D.C shouted down we all heard the story right here in Houston, Texas or

and some guy from South Carolina all being I'm guessing South Carolina's still very segregated compared to be melting pot that it's used in\nBut they didn't realize that there are my friends and made the comment that I was speaking slowly as I tend to do here on the radio because I was trying to avoid saying the N word to be two strangers that we're sitting next to me of course responded those are two of my closest friends are French jumped in and he blocked me coward\nBut this assumption that we're not a melting pot that we're not a diversity of diverse voices is is is destroyed by anyone

music replay of last Saturday's show a special special show and\nTonight on the stage we've got Omar soccer who has become sort of a fixture in the the scene here uses is what is what I'm told Omar\nUh you're you're involved in various aspects of entertainment to the Houston area well a yes or I I play\nA lot of music around town a with a couple of different events and they organize music show ... different bars around\nMy maybe we can follow you around and see how it's done yeah some of the bands that you play in\nWell right now is mainly my project says just Omar poker and uh I play also and ah my friend's project which is just Bradley ...\nOh I I I Know Bradley basket yeah yeah I play with him all I think we had him on the show case last year oh probably yeah it could do a little bit about your background\nOr I'm originally from Mexico City and uh I play a lot of Spanish music and I've been doing it for Fifteen Years\nNow so Fifteen Years yeah so you're you're kind of a statesman then hear music thing or are you uh do you have a music on SoundCloud or CD Baby\nOr no right now to my new stuff is still working on it I still yeah she's going to partner\nNow have you been in the in the music business for for almost two decades now it's so easy as an artist I think now to be able to record songs\nBut because you you could do it with these you know with the software that's on you know it comes on the laptop their problem is\nIt also allows you to sit there and tinker with it and go back and fix it and smooth things out as opposed to just committing to to go into a studio like a sure hill or something and you're you've got three hours this is what we're gonna get dumb so do you find yourself in the whole axle rose Chinese Democracy thing going back in and re tweaking songs over and over again\nYeah absolutely I think I went through it wasn't like that but now you know I now I Try to do it live since I've been playing with uh my friend Bradley we've been doing everything life so uh for example with his band we've never had a rehearsal really see how we've done everything live with\nYou know from open ... showcases and just improvising\nBetter you are you recording some of these performances now\nUh with his band we have with my project we haven't yet but we were trying to do that [noise]\nYep that a lot of people go into the studio they create a sound and then they're never able to recapture that sounded a live performance yeah totally a a a ... as ... there's a million stories about that but but I mean obviously the goal is to be able to\nTo craft music that you can then perform in front of an audience and then there's people that are performed brilliantly in front of audiences but they release assigned like well that's ... ... where it's not the same where where's the salaries I think we interviewed Johnny ... who's been around\nFor a couple of decades and he said that he had so much criticism about his studio recording songs as opposed to his lab performance but he just started recording this live performances and he actually put out a couple of albums\nYou know that's actually exactly what I Want to do I I'm I'm not interested in doing ... when I went to record everything in life\nOr a million years ago when we started doing this show and it was it was obviously pre recorded a we would go back in a post production and we would spend hours yeah so I just read everything I ... you know what people people don't expect you to sound perfect exactly yeah they wanna they wanna they wanna feel you they want to see the emotion and so so good\nI feel like they want you to sound real more than ... perfect that's perfect ... uh so um\nWhat are your influences and obviously you're going to be doing some Spanish or yeah language music force denied but what are your are your books as\nWell then sell it plays a gold ... buffalo maker which is kind of like a a let's say Cuban music goes back to Spain and it's you know interpreted by like ... a\nMusician and is that very intense a guitar playing right\nA little bit yes mainly arithmetic like flamenco for a real flamingo is a little bit more intense in the play but whom by as many bred them\nGood All right uh\nSo when\nIn the future do you think that the ... project is going to put out a long awaited offer a\nI'm a you know I'm I'm thinking about it by the end of the year I'm going to have something where they at least like anybody with three for something\nGood to have goals but not too much pressure\nUh All right so I'm now a little background as some of the songs you to play like like like you said it is going to be in Spanish language so um\nDo you think of for the the non bilingual do you think that the emotions and the intent of the song will become obvious or do you need to give a little explanation before we get into it but now I think it's going to be really evidence and it speaks for itself\nYou know it's funny because we were talking about I guess ... billion um\nThe um the weight of is the social project and the gypsy kings were two of the acts that helped a kind of introduce the concept of Latin music to angle audiences without anyone ever understanding the lyrics because there was so much emotion devolved into ... obsessively\nActually one of the things that are going to plays one of the social clubs\nOut on that I discovered the gypsy kings in a war that out to the guy had among my third ...
