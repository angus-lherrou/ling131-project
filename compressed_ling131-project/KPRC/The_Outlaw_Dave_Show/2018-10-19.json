I mean not everyone everyone will have a health problem at some point in life because we're all gonna die right but I disagree with the notion that the government bureaucracy would provide better solution than the horror story that the health care situation in America\nIs today clearly we meet a ... a solution clearly we need we need more\nCompetition and less monopolies once you begin your care right where the doctor compels you to get the MRI or the hospital has complete control and could charge\nWhatever they want and this is the prices have just continue to skyrocket it's absurd it destroys even the health care costs can destroy middle class even upper middle class families healthcare is not available for many people that are low income but I still disagree that the government will probably by the best solution\nBut people would agree with me on that that live in Houston and didn't buy insurance\nI think that the government should pay for their house and I know I don't want to hear that still welfare it's just welfare for people that look like you and me and it's still wrong you can't have it both ways period\nIf you disagree with me I Love talking about someone three two one two five nine five zero but get bogged down I I was inspired by the story about the Cajun Navy helping out the children in South Carolina\nI wanted to bring them on I'm Glad they're on later on the show we're going to have Jeff deal the a GOP candidate for US Senate running against Elizabeth Warren ... Mandel Elizabeth Warren is making a joke out of ourself this week\nBut there was a story I Want to touch on could we get a little a little Snow White from your Chris\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWho's now at twenty three year old in medical school in California [noise]\nRecent graduate of Harvard University would only watch Snow White for about two years of her life it got to the point where my wife to recite every line of the movie word for word\nThere was an unusual line where she says ... said\nThat we've tried to interpret over and over again\nBut that's only because we as as as young young married couple could break down every aspect of that movie because we probably watch to ten thousand times\nWe had every VHS every movie she wanted to watch or you could possibly watch but that was all that little Matty Adams wanted to watch was Snow White actress Kristen Bell had a conversation with parents magazine this week about Snow White being problematic\nAnd I quote don't you think that it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission because you cannot kiss someone up there sleeping\nSo apparently prince charming rape Snow White when he saved her from the poison apparently that would prevent prince charming from beginning confirmed as the United States Supreme court justice apparently\nWe're all going crazy\nI I look at the headquarters some more I look at my girls and ask don't you think it's weird the Snow White didn't ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple\nOr she got the apple I say I would never take food from a stranger would you and my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right\n[noise]\nOh he pool and plot point can we stop pretending that there is something wrong with everything\nPrince charming is about as much of a rapist is Brett Kavanaugh by that I mean not at all\n\nI'm just tired right it just gets old right just at some point as Americans we have to stop we have to stop pretending that it's okay\nBut it's normal to tear down every single thing\n\nAnd you know when it's also not okay to do it's not okay to decry bigotry\nWhen you respond with bigotry I was looking at a book I like to read books that I disagree with\nJust like I like to be friends with people I don't have any a logical agreements with because I think diversity leaves the vibrancy\nBut\nI was looking at a book by Robin ... low entitled white fragility Chris are you fragile you seem kinda fragile your twenty to you like ... music we figure that out yesterday on the show um fragile\nUm yeah I could be wrong\nBut this isn't the fragile ... fragility when I'm not speaking the words right and that's the kind of my job right now\nI'm that the academic an educator robbing the Angelo who has taught diversity training and cultural competency workshops for major corporations all across America she wrote this book about how white people respond poorly\nTo cultural competency education I Would call it re education\nShe says there why people were insist they were taught to treat everyone the same that they are colorblind to they don't care if you're a pink purple poke about it they'll point to friends and family members of color a history of civil rights activism or more salient positions\nAnd she rejects all of this\nShe thinks that it makes them complicit in the white supremacy and the patriarchy\n\nShe argues that are largely segregated society has set up to inflate whites from racial discomfort so they don't and that's why they follow the pieces of the first application of stress she wrote this entire\nBook speaking holistically about white people an entire book insulting white people went our whole job is to explain why why people shouldn't insult other people\nI don't get this Charles

ride All right All right your buddy out well\nDave uh in the nine one one garage door service dot com studios it was earlier in the week before everything got crazy we had a chance to sit down with a congressional candidate Dan Crenshaw\nHe is a retired military veteran a decorated a member of the armed forces who has become a dark horse candidate best in the competition receiving the GOP nomination progress you know district to to replace Ted Poe\nA lot of people said that he wasn't going to even make it into a runoff he did and he won the runoff that being said\nYeah he does face in opponents but the interesting thing is that he is addressing the needs and concerns of congressional district too which is from the east side of town all the way to the west side of town in an odd that district drawn but interestingly enough\nA district that was heavily affected by Hurricane Harvey and we're talking about ways to address that\nIt's a little bit of ... matter of engineering how do we funded I liked the direction we're going right now it's always moving a little bit too slowly but I have a very detailed plan\nUm strategy that we put out and you know what the full knowledge that it's ever changing I talk a lot about this and what are you supposed to do from Congress\nSo I look at what legislation like you know water resource development act or can we are getting real nerdy here but this is exactly what you need to look at what committees I Would beyond actually I'm past that kind of legislation which authorize Army Corps of engineers projects\nThat that's really important to does your military background give you a little bit more of an asset or advantage there it it does so I mean because after I got hurt I had to kind of a different career okay and it was it was it was less\nLeading men in combat a lot more working across federal agencies putting in broader strategic plans I'm very used to working with with different federal agencies and we're used to working with the army\nWhether it's the Army Corps of engineers or regular army at St Louis I speak the language\nAnd I'm In what I Do understand is that lives in ... but obstacles in your way\nAnd then it's your job to say okay tell me the obstacles so that I can sell because I had the power to solve those obstacles for you while you're you know is it a bureaucrat generally says well I Can't do it so I Can't do it and here's why\nI say okay got it those are the reasons let's break down those reasons because I'm supposed to have the power to do that and let's get this done I mean and so that's that's how I look at it and it's working together it's cooperating with local um you know city county state federal let's get this done who's the senior member of the Texas\nDelegation of Republicans or governors [noise]\nI don't I Know it was so busy and so we gotta we gotta lotta corner and we're not a lot of the ... the senior right editors\nA ... so have you done to get assuming that we make it the ... have you done to kind of get the lay of the land and figure out what you're going to need to do and what your I mean it sounds like you're already working on a plan of action to serve your district\nYeah now I'm definitely in contact with house leadership um I I've committed trying to raise money for house leadership I'm not specifically for them but for members who are in trouble ... you know keep Texas read\nNation read that's that's that's that I'm working on Tuesday running our campaign or also are already\nAre trying to do more for the party [noise] um [noise] you know we we've got a lot of great leaders from the Texas delegation particular All right uh you know a chairman of multiple committee so Kevin Brady I'm max or marry a ... sessions all chairman a committee and I missing a couple actually but Texas is very strong when do we ... we\nWork with writer before he seems like a a ups in a guy ... seem very accessible [noise] um [noise]\nNot not asking you to speak to a the race for the ... the Texas senator race [noise]\nBut I wanted you to comment um [noise]\nI find it interesting that there's a lot of outside rallying\nFor this upstart democratic challenger\nHim making appearances on a like late night talk shows and is it that sort of an orthodox and what are the voters think about that or is that more of a a a long game um grooming but he's his handlers are affecting well I think what you're\nWhat you're observing is is is the shift at the Democratic party to liberal coastal elites and they went when I say that I Know it kinda just sounds like rhetoric\nBut it's it's fundamentally after a while it's fundamentally true so it's it's not surprising that a guy like him he's charismatic he seems like a fun guy [noise] um it's it's not surprising and he's very liberal so any ... you know to his credit he's very honest about how ... really is a Kevin\nThat [laughter] 'cause there's a lot there's not enough that all that there's a lot of\nCandidates running in Texas on the Democratic side who really mask how far left they are thrown in there that is they give the sort of um [noise] ... you know did they give\nThis meant but they're very middle of the road and well they are\nThey talking about you know common sense pragmatism whose common sense and pragmatic for him like you know in that and that's why it's important to take a stand on issues it really is an on your on your on your underlying principles and and the foundations that you approach governance\nRight I'll give it to bed or at least he does that All right but and and so it's it's very obvious to me why he might be popular with again you're liberal coastal elites that's what's that's what they want to see in Texas is a huge target and they can turn Texas they can turn everything\nBut I didn't go ahead Ken they I don't do well apathy in my legs but it is it like this is predominant\nOh let's turn this into this liberal state a bit by a empty the coffers and put everybody on the test that that isn't a pervasive sentiment of the country so the only thing that could see a tied to blue or to a purple would be apathy or laziness on the part of the the the conservative base\nYou're probably right and and I don't think it's working in Texas to be clear you know ... the last poll had to resign nine points so ... and it's not likely to change very much and I think most ... voters are decided at this point [noise] uh the Kavanaugh effect Israel and um and I and a lot a lot of voters were upset by how the Democrats approach that entire\nHearing and Jesus I mean we can go into that forever but that that that's really help it last and a cruise is the is the campaign Harding as he needs to get out there with the people are and that's what he's doing and we'll just we'll see more of that [noise]\nI was a chagrin to read this story about how he and his wife or a ... a while they were out trying to eat the the the video no I did terrible\nIf that it it's the new normal you know it if if if conservative act that way or the the swift reaction would be studying\nThat this is tolerated accepted and Maxine Waters says you need to go find these conservatives where they where they where they shop and and then tell them that is that to me is a lack of civil tea\nIs supposed to a simplified our our political dialogue I'm supposed to be civil about it was supposed to be a ladies and gentlemen were supposed to have this course and that's what this country was founded on now we've got shouting matches and and and the bullying and its imitation\nAnd and it's it's it's really frustrating to see 'em you know we we call them mobs and the the mainstream media well I mean I see it I mean I'm not you know I don't I don't I don't quote far less media right I only quote mainstream media\nIt be and you know and right you know and and and that's the ... the double standard is is is what's I think is frustrating to so many conservative of because we're told that well you're a mob to no no no I mean words matter okay definitions matter\nActions matter so let's let's have a real discussion about this a Trump rally they they call that a mob okay well the Trump rallies inside a building they're not attacking anybody All right yeah they sound very boisterous\nAgain here at the very first one to get that moon when the president said hey knock him out you know yeah don't say that\nThat's fine it's you know let's let's be honest like let's let's let's condemn that but now give it I was a couple of years ago and this is now the U.S condemn this also this is not okay\nEverybody everybody's defenses that someone else is doing something worse like that somehow makes the action okay and I guess that that's where the frustration comes and\nIt's like we need parents to come in and go okay wait he did at first it doesn't matter who go to your body and your room at the end of the day you're going to battle for the people in your district\nAnd trying to help them out [noise] and that's a good\nThing congressional district number two uh is it it's a strong red district\nI I I Would say so uh it's it's it's um assessed that are eleven so Ted Poe wanted was sixty percent of the vote last election and uh we're hoping to keep that are beat that so and they\nHave real uh issues and concerns or in the coming years as she talked about recovery still from from Hurricane Harvey er and to that and uh it's not just about the recovery it's about preventing a the impact mitigating the except for next time and I believe that your your district as on is it a couple of the some of the the eastern part of the city\nSo some of the run off that we saw from up north lake Houston\nYes like you and that was a district and that was what happened there [noise]\nYou know it was the same thing with addicts decisions had to be made but if it might district as addict and like Houston oh that that's what I say some of the hardest ...\nNovel up all of that that is absolutely a focal point I don't have a question\nFor you is there any other campaign stop say he'll be making sale [noise]\nBoy we're all over the place so we we try to spread it out between kind in the northwest northeast and inside the loop though I mean my district goes all the way down to Rice University it sneaks up to the heights in spring branch and addicts and spring and champions uh then it goes east a humble task casinos\nUsed and draw those aren't graph paper he\nHad everybody here at the table and we live all over the line I like\nTo streets outside of his well you could just go guess voted the other district\nIt would be wrong it was a felony balls and do not ever do that I hadn't I wake up and\nI Can't wake I've I only have one I\nJust delete it\nThey're going to look at I pat\nWhere's the beautiful his courage today uh\nShe she couldn't make it and she's actually at a wedding this weekend I couldn't I obviously could not go to the wedding I I'm ... ...\nSimply I Would I Would use that issues and he then he tells his wedding dog jobs huh honey I got it right now is ... ... ... he was yeah I\nWas a little apprehensive I think I think the word was used the optics the optics on this guy I mean yeah that word and he's like well I called berries but we will be a barrier has been a just such a a a a generous and and\nI did rock radio for twenty something years and they had a a ... it was gone and I said I don't know what to do an woman adjusted moved on to our station\nAnd I went to Michael barrier after some some good Joanna begging pleading he actually sat down for six months I if I told your story you sign up for six months every day and he would counsel may\nBe for my show and I did like a one hour show that I go to our show so he said that every day for six months before and after the show and he basically taught me how to do talk radio but not in his style in my style and he would be like this is how I got what they would do it\nAnd he said at the end of six months he goes bam boy\nI thought she was uttered [laughter]\nBut you are smart you take direction well if you're a humble and uh as soon as you finished leviathan I think will be up to speed\nRead Hobbs or via the coach at all the time and I'm like oh yeah yeah I went to North closet intellectual guy and he loves to give direction I always been shuttered but hey we can sign is a a an he is you know he has\nA ban in in politics and that is sort of a public service and hire a and it has certainly started this humidity well he has chosen to not pursue politics anymore I Hope that he did discourage you from doing so\nNow you know he he definitely told me he thought I was going to lose [laughter] wow yeah I like the boy but you know next time man that everybody told us that I mean it was like he got we really like you um you know in this doesn't work out you know well we hope we hope you keep trying\nDoes that make the victory little sweeter yeah yeah ... we just don't think that way right like I I was never an option we all do you\nEver ever ... yeah ... you know the way you get their buds seal training you don't give yourself an
