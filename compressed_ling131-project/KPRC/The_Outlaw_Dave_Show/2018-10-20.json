fell across [laughter]\nThat may my sandals very [laughter] very shy meat Chuck Taylor is there anything you want to see while you're here in Houston besides me\nA minute I recommend me to ride a horse in the barbecues and I wanted it to my I'm\nSorry [laughter]\nAh so you you've been in a Miami at least a decade but yeah if you think about where you grew up in Venezuela what was your childhood like\nSome people are very like they like to me that really does and we stay\nI don't think that was the case I think they just you know ... we have we just came out of the large downturn in the economy and I think a stewardship was one of the things that was last year to you need to be a good steward of your customer you need to look out for their money\nOr do a quality job at a competitive reasonable price and that's that's really where we wanted to be we wanted to come in and provide that are not just because of the customer and he'd just\nGo in and take advantage of that situation we wanted to do right and really grow a lasting relationship\nWell and so what industries are you serving right now because you got started doing a because oil fields in a downturn you started doing some power generation what all industries are you in a ... at this point\nAt this point actively a power generation and oil and gas\nThen what part of oil and gas what type of of equipment are you actually going in and working or\nAre we are just in terminals right now uh so there you have your small small frame ... pops a small auxiliary equipment things of that nature okay\nCompressors things like that you're you're you're the name of the the company's Texas compression but you actually a fairly small amount of your work is compression wrecked\nWe originally our goal was to go after midstream compression wants to market came back ah however we've been following the lead of our customers and adapting to their needs and that's why we've maintained a presence in power generation and uh now we're steadily moving into oil and\nGas now the skill set required to work on compressors is the same skills that required to work on a lot of the very end kinds of rotating quickly to correct\nIt is it is your ah most of your Recep compressors they don't really spend a\nSeventy ... about the only thing that spans or anything that spends a but you know it's a\nIt's just the disciplines are the same so\nInteresting now talking about the uh people side of it where you talked in the ... at the beginning of the of the segment where do you go about finding people with this very specific skill\nSet a well I myself I started in the field so we know just by nature we have a good network of mechanics that we've turned branches within the past churn through those individuals it's it's more of a network of finding people through people and then looking in identifying young talent\nSeeing who has the mental aptitude for it I mean when you think about a a a large room turban\nAnd like a couple of hundred times and to think that that piece of equipment is brought into within a couple of thousands tolerance sure there's there's some magic to that there's some skill at some crap that goes into that and the tension that detail\nWell you know we've talked throughout the trade show the labor shortages than a theme that came up\nTime and time again right and and I think there's an incredible opportunity out there for for young people that uh uh can pass a drug test and show up reasonably on time right yeah to to earn a very very nice living learning a skill\nA and I'll be willing to bet that most young people don't even know that this was a thing right\nNow you know it's uh it's amazing\nYou know what I I've done quite a bit of traveling and when you think about like some of the power plants that worked in in the northeast that were a hundred years old these are things that you know our grandfathers and their parents it's there's some there's some history there you're putting something on you're putting your hands on a piece of equipment that's\nOlder most things in Houston sure and so there's there's a little bit of a\nA romance associated with it I hate using that term but and this is a it's a craft or something to be proud of and there's a lot of opportunity for young individuals who don't feel that college is the right avenue for a\nWhile and it isn't the right avenue for everybody nor should be the right avenue for everybody quite\nA year after instead a there's a lot of work right now that a lot of work has been put off because of the downturn trained you go into that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Outlaw Dave Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
