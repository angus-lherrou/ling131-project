appreciate\nUh and and cherish um live music and all of the danger that goes into playing live and I say danger not in the\nGetting your head cut off or your legs broken kind of danger but when you're performing live everything from equipment failure to your voice cracking to slipping on the floor you know it's dangerous it's life and that's what makes it fun and exciting it's it's a roller coaster ride\nOf emotion every night even when you've been doing it for a long time\nAnd there are people that are truly the friends of uh\nAnd I've been very fortunate in various incarnations whether I was in the mid west or Texas or new Englander back in Texas or whatever to have met a and and gotten to know several people who truly will do anything to help uh keep the scene alive because they love it and they needed\nAnd in Houston one of the um one of the truest friends of music is a is a lady named Terri el Thompson\nWho not only is a A N on a singer songwriter and her own regards but who spends hours every single day on every single form you can think of promoting\nUm you know other bands every jam in town every day of the week an open Mike slide music gigs Venus people saying that they're looking for bands cetera and she truly is a friend of music and and whether you know it or not a lot of the band so that we have talked about on here\n[noise] uh all the way from ... in Seoul signed
