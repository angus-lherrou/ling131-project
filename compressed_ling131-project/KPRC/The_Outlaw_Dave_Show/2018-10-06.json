I'm Sorry people should not sweating neck was lying ... a Ford is having some sort of suppress memory nonsense her story is falling apart mirrors I think is the most credible what there was a possibility that we got drunk and wiped it out\nBut you know what we all did a bunch of ignorance stuff in college and I'm Sorry that that happened to her\nBut I don't think it should disqualify him thirty some years later after life in public service\nBut let's put it can ... let's move on to nine eleven so what are your thoughts on nine eleven Mr Brown\nWell you know we needed more and more security we needed more intelligence gathering here in the state to prevent something like that from happening I mean it's my belief that our intelligence community already knew that something was cooking up over there and what was going to happen\nMaybe they didn't know but I Believe they did a you know I don't think especially I mean\nTwo planes into buildings you know how do you get into buildings and and but I mean I think that that was the perfect catalyst for them to come in and start grabbing power with the with the Patriot act\nAnd I think the government turned a blind eye to that tragedy or just a shoulder to it because it would be a mechanism for expansion of governmental power and authority\nOh yeah I really [noise] yeah you were like you think the world where\nThe deep state was aware and they let it happen because it was the vehicle by which they can have more\nMore control over the American population\nVery good at the deep state I mean the yeah I mean I I mean I kind of become come to believe that at the left in the rye and I mean they're uh they're they're the same thing same ... in it and there and I I you know I I put fascism communist amongst ...\nGoing to the right now you gradually getting less and less government until you get a full on anarchy which I've come to become a proponent for in the later years of my life\nBut they enter you mean just anyone doing anything to anybody and there's no control you protect yourself with your own guns there is no police there is no fire there's no schools\nWhere you can get into in our kids and our cynical but I mean at this point I don't get any man should be in control of anyone else I mean I think that record shows that it can be done with the abuse that you see you know going on in in historic regimes and even ... even today you know what's going on with\nWith what's going on with what going to cut you off sir please\nI I mean the nanny state you know I mean okay they want I mean look what's going on in the streets\nOkay a\nMilitary nation at the police force\nRight but you don't know so when you served did you serve in Iraq or Afghanistan or both\nA time in Afghanistan\nOkay and do this this cynicism or is is that that is is\nDownstream as a reaction to your service or is this something you brought with you into the service or I Need to call cynicism or is this this this divergent viewpoints for mainstream America when did this when did you adopt this was before your service or after your service\nI Believe ... going in\nBut I really kind of came to this ... how I Am today I was not in a conspiracy theories I Believe that night we didn't have any way the way that the nine eleven condition laid it all out right now you know I guess about the time to Sandy Hook and I believe I'm not saying I don't believe any of it and I don't I I Believe that people\nDie I Can't tolerate 'cause I Know a no families that lost their children\nThere I think I Know the crisis actor nonsense is just not that that's not what I'm Talking about that's ridiculous\nI Alex Jones or the ...\nOr ... but you know we've got we've only got about two minutes before the show\nUm [noise] what led you\nTo serve though I think that I mean I Know you're you're of all on your positions and you've become more woke in your in your your thought but what what was the ... the motivation to genesis

but we've got a good time talking to a Bobby I Do think Kavanaugh will get confirmed\nI Believe it will I Do think that this FBI report it you know the Democrats are moving the goalposts right now was you know now Booker says he doesn't care if he's guilty or innocent\nBlumenthal says if if the FBI who they've been they've been be added to find the FBI for Russia but now they're criticizing the FBI and saying that if the FBI doesn't differ to their selection of witnesses to be\nInterviewed it's not about investigation was sunk I reached doing a very\nScenic after\nEvery mass shooting they're like oh oh yeah we were watching that guy we we we we have to tell us we heard about him that FBI\nWill be able to that is and I'm not surprised by your cynical view on the federal building because I
