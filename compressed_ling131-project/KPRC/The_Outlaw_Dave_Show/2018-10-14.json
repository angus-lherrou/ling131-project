Mart's that they serve the communities where the stores are located uh they make cash donations to charities in their region\nWhere the stores are located they monitor outreach programs and they

pick me up ... case remarkably similar to catch up on them tastes like taking high so that being said Fifteen\nYears ago Jim Pruitt lamented to me and another in the boat you know things are really struggling at the ranch it's it's you know people are donating like they used to or they weren't on the radio anymore so they didn't have that that unlimited bully pulpit\nAnd we said hey we've been

probably\nFifty of those being said instead of high rollers that were our roads are all over the years have seen a high watermark of over Seventeen hundred riders raising tens of thousands of dollars to a cannonball run\nI don't know what that means but I'm going to go first to the same individuals that I defer to Fifteen Years ago when we jumped right is that I knew in Iraq hey let's just say All

I don't know who to ...\nCalling up out of his nose diving quick I'm not any branch and I'm way more right now [laughter]\nThe Grinch I'll show you how many years active service or just over ten years and years and ah and you you you gave that up to pursue a serving the community\nHere in Texas you're running for congressional district number two two are replacing Ted Poe yes who in his is about a decade he's been a lot of good just over a decade uh decided to retire he's retiring and so uh the void had to be filled\nOr you stepped up or ... minutes and words you're a you're considered a dark horse candidate at ah we we we read what you were about a week we liked Joe from the beginning had you on the show months ago a as you said all I can hope for is a runoff\nWith Catherine wall mhm uh you got the run off your you beat her though in in the in the\nIn the primary rhyming by a hundred and fifty five votes so you know if you look at the viewer over to be on the bottom end of that right away what we were we were at the very bottom where is the bottom doubted you could get and\nStill make it um you know to put this into perspective so you know Texas is very early primaries yeah probably early in the country\nAnd the but the even earlier than that his ballot by mail right in the Republican primary you're getting a lot of senior citizens doing ballot by mail they're they're heavy primary voters so we lost all of them because they didn't know me right right I got started campaigning maybe and you know we decided to run in November\nNobody campaigns in December so you've got January and then and then early voting you know that\nShould have them invest in the rally [laughter] we can do this just four months yeah or less\nRight out really pulled all of that around on it as a short notice he's like a hired I or notice\nAbout a ... yeah ... it and I would actually compress that even more I Would say religious January address I'm a huge because ballot by mail starts you know first week of February or we lost all of those 'cause nobody knew me and then our momentum started to take off the second week of early voting in a late February\nYou got some good of bugs in the press not just local national what do you attribute that to\nOutlaw Dave [laughter] it'd be Michael barrier well they got everything at age ... [laughter]\nWell good luck buddy\nMichael buried to your point huge blessing and a we've become good friends and I'm absolutely made a Fox News good took us up a few times and it was just telling her story ran across the district about a hundred miles that helped a little bit about how we got some attention to that are raising money for Hurricane Harvey volunteers\nUm 'cause I mean people still rebuilding even months and months later oh well now are still go\nUm we got all that and you know so election day comes\nRight we knew we had all the momentum we knew we were going to win election day but we didn't know it was going to be enough so election day comes and goes right in the polls close to seven PM\nAnd here the numbers were looking at All right we're in third place a twenty percent Kathleen wall was in second place at twenty seven percent Kevin Roberts was in first place for thirty three percent that's a pretty huge margins guy so so now we just wait for the the boxes to come in from election day itself and they come in little by little\nAnd we see we see us climate see is catching up catching up catching up and it starts to taper off\nAnd so we're like man it's like two AM everybody goes to sleep well our supporters go to sleep for like\nI lost in the wake up the next morning we we we squeak by by a hundred and fifty five votes how\nDo you have like at one staffer who stayed up with you that you're just going to keep ... stayed up meals they didn't like that but one her yeah who was like I'm just going to do it any well the other\nParty stayed up I mean I mean our regular voters so many people told us the next day we all went to bed without your last you know are disappointed but then it woke up and go down a not so much right yeah yeah we're we're all about we know plan B man it was like like just go all in a\nShow did you feel that the runoff was contentious or ... or did you feel that you had already bested your opponent um as far as rhetoric went it felt\nA little contentious um 'cause there was about a million dollars spent just you know by attacking me\n[laughter] that was a fellow that fell contentious\nSaid that and do you I mean when you go into this you go into that expecting that right you go into that with what you think it's thick skin and it's where you were you a little surprised at how I wasn't\nThat surprising I think we news coming I think you know this is politics after all I'm I'm used to the combat um this is a different form of combat it's a little it's a little bit more does honest a wonderful thing about combat is\nReal combat is there is a true sense of honesty to it\nAnd this is not like that and and they never wellbeing and we got into it knowing that and that's fine um I Wish it wasn't that way but it is and and frankly voters voters responded\nVery strongly um voters do not like NATO negative campaigning voters are getting very sick of your typical political campaigning they always appreciate I answer questions very directly say exactly what I think I Would disagree with voters will not tell you what you want to hear\n'em and and and the people that are religious share a blade reject that\nAnd uh they they pretty sure that you don't just make a weird attacks on your opponent so ...\nWhat what what was the margin of victory or during the run of wasn't\nGreat it was only thirty percent\n[laughter] we we did I make\nSeventy percent of the vote we had sixty nine point nine percent of the ... we were yeah well that at a feel good because it was a good question and this is a lot of like the next one\n[laughter] or does the does\nDoes a hurricane like this coming through like we had last year and how much of that um do you take into consideration you know in terms of the biggest part is the biggest part of the flooding in Houston is\nWell especially the second district and the right district was I mean if you started to look at the map of the second district some of the hardest hit parts from from Harvey so it's number one mhm it's number one of the primary similar to the\nGeneral the wonderful thing about it as a bipartisan not a lot of arguing going on it's it's it's a little bit it's a matter of we all ... it's a little bit of ... matter of engineering how do we funded I like the direction we're going right now it's always moving a little bit too slowly but I have a very detailed plan\nUm strategy that we put out and you know with the full knowledge that it's ever changing\nI talk a lot about this and what are you supposed to do from Congress so I look at what legislation like you know water resource development act or can we are getting real nerdy here but this is exactly what you need to look at what committees I Would beyond actually I'm past that kind of legislation which authorize Army Corps of engineers projects\nThat that's really important to does your military\nBackground give you a little bit more of an asset or advantage there it it does so I mean because after I got hurt I had to kind of a different career\nOkay and it was it was it was less leading men in combat a lot more in a working across federal agencies putting in broader strategic plans I'm very used to working with with different federal agencies and we're used to working with the army whether it's the Army Corps of engineers or regular army Saint Louis I speak the language\nAnd I'm In what I Do understand is that lives in Iraq or ... but obstacles in your way\nAnd then it's your job to say okay tell me the obstacles so that I can stop because I had the power to solve those obstacles for you while you're you know is there a bureaucrat generally says well they can't do it I Can't do it and here's why\nThen draw those aren't graph paper [laughter] everybody here at the table and we live on the line I like\nTo streets outside of his well you could just go guess voted the other district [laughter]\nIt was wrong it would be a felony balls and do not ever do that I had a nice way now\nI Can't wake I only have one I I'm just lazy [laughter]\n\nAre you going to look wait I bet you know\nWhere's the beautiful as Crenshaw today uh\nShe she couldn't make it and she's actually at a wedding this weekend I couldn't I obviously could not go to the wedding I Am ... constantly\nI Would use that as I say I would use that excuse ... she tells me the\nWedding dog jobs huh honey hey I gotta go hang out with ... ...\nI remember him he was\n[laughter] I Know she was\nA little apprehensive I think it's I think the word was used the optics the optics on this guy I mean yeah that word and he's like well I called berries but will you will be a barrier has been a just such a a a a generous and and I did rock radio for twenty something years now and uh and then it was gone\nAnd I said I I don't know what to do and the woman adjusted moved on to our station and I went to Michael barrier after some some good Joanna begging pleading\nHe actually sat down for six months I if I told your story he signed up for six months every day and he would counsel may\nBe for my show and I did like a one hour show that I got to do our show so it said that every day for six months before and after the show and he basically taught me how to do talk radio but not in his style in my style he would be like this is how I got what they would do it\nAnd he said at the end of six months ago so damn boy I thought she was a herd [laughter]\nBut you are smart you take direction well and you're a humble and uh as soon as you've finished leviathan

attorney but hey we can assign is All right yeah uh and he is you know he has\nA ban in in politics and that is sort of a public office and hire a and uh it has certainly service humidity well he has chosen to not pursue politics anymore I Hope that he did discourage you from doing so\nNow you know he he definitely told me he thought I was going to lose [laughter] wow yeah I live in a bar but you know next time now not everybody told us that I mean it was like hey we really like you um you know in this doesn't work out you know well we hope we hope you keep trying does\nThat make the victory little sweeter yeah yeah in ... we just don't think that way right like I I was never an option\nWe all do you ever ever military's yeah ... you know the way you get through buds and seal training you don't give yourself an option you cannot quit if you think to yourself OK I'm going to try this try not to quit\nRight you will quit how long do you hold your breath and seal training\nTwenty minutes ... I Know it's like twenty five or thirty\nYou know [laughter]\nYeah they do now is that a little bit of that but a lot of people do pass out just from\nThe thing is if you visualize missing the wastebasket with your paper what\nYou will miss it yeah if you ... hitting it right when you're yeah you never visualize weddings we went into this with NO PLAN B because I have a plan B very um you know a hundred and ten percent committed that's what you do that's how you're going to graduate I says you know we're rooting for you thank you a Lexus coming up November\nThe six six November ... early voting early voting starts October twenty ...

could add a published author a member of the whiskey brothers are currently have a special\nRunning on Amazon Amazon Prime\nUh tours the world entertaining the troops were going to talk about that but more importantly a here in Houston you are a hero a almost a patriarch ... of the comedy scene and you will be represented in the next friday or is it warehouse live\nYeah man you know what a stage I have not been back we shut our special there are a few years back the one that's available right now of course on Amazon Amazon Prime you can watch the whiskey brothers yeah uh I'm going to be at a warehouse with Jim Norton who I have not worked with since the last stop\nReally back I mean the the legendary last stop so Jim ... coming through he's playing warehouse and uh\nI'm jumping in and then a trade touching who's also in the whiskey brothers with me is going to do a few minutes up front so\nIt's right great touching a joined the whiskey brothers in the past year yeah he's a rising star the Houston company saying\nIs spectacular and a ... you know I I submitted myself for the gig and they they picked me and they also asked who else was around in Houston I\nThrew some names Adam naturally I was happy when they came back with the guy that I had already vetted and agreed on a but more importantly men gym Norton is a beast\nOf a comic is certainly controversial he is certainly dirty you know one for tough crowd you know ... and Anthony but he's coming down and this is kind of a cool for me it's kind of cool because comedy is sort of moved out of the mainstream clubs a little bit for some of the bigger guys and but there are more of a\nTheater in rock club kind of thing and Doug Stanhope sort of champion that years ago and guys like Jim Norton is sort of realized that you can go in and you can\nWith your fan base sell out one big show in Iraq venue and its way better than playing six or seven shows over the course of five days right I'm amount of people are so he's coming through and he's got a lot of new material and uh I'm doing support on that so it means a half hour of a low Houston century I'm going to talk a lot of trash I got some stuff to get as much as\nYeah raised ... ... as I Know uh\nThat's actually one of my favorite things about coming to your show who wants to do with heckler it's my favorite it's my favorite my absolute Bailey handed member\nWe did the Clear Channel with the show when you're like what you're going to say they're doing it was above us I think and you're like uh-huh\nGo there and watches you know what do you call a vote might not get there and this guy was new was he was funny and he was killed it and then some dropped in and broken down and say that given that I came into my hearing\n[laughter] to grease the door on your way late [laughter]\nAll certainly getting killed I was going to a car to get a gun and we're all gonna die now they usually by the time they make it out of the car they realize they need to cry a little bit and then we got all the time of the world I mean I knew you before then but I was like\nA respect us carrier you've broken down so hard slate ... who's weren't even touching the ground that it was amazing it excites me man I and I don't get to play here like right off that an yeah well certainly town I mean it's not only behind shepherd that do but the point is\nNow I don't get to play here often also sentiment I mean Robin shows now\nIn some instances the only time are the only chance people get a chance to to see you are is either when you do one of your life podcast day because of the ... the the ... and your Christmas special\nThat's it uh which of course is happening this year with a second to miss me on friday or you can certainly come out December twenty second at the secret group\nAh we're doing it starts falling for that again are [laughter] it's all will will tell you the address you know it's one hundred\nOld yeah he's entertaining he's an old man but he's very old\nI Would think it would be hilarious if they ran by ... and then still talked about how old Trump was [laughter] if you're like trouble like Seventy five right like he's going to be old with all this goes down it's like this tit for tat never stops [laughter] 'cause it was a vestige earlier this week\nThey are like we don't want another wide old person up there in in a in the there's a lot of people that think that that Beto and I'm Ted Cruz or running for governor [noise] oh yeah like they don't understand the bills in it they don't understand\nWhat a senator does no um [noise] they think that they can actually be in charge of the state yes\nOh no yeah yeah they think that he's going to like oh like in a helicopter like ... ... you know that\nThat's not to call them that I like him I Know he would probably enjoy that I don't think he will you don't think so no\nI I I wouldn't call them ... it's it's it's a term of affection local journalist I didn't [laughter] it's a term of it's a term of endearment [laughter] I I I'm On the right side of things I don't need to like you know like everybody all anyway\nBut like governor Abbott\nYeah you know the one of the helicopters you know one when he shot caller yeah and that's not what a senator as you know so who are other people on the list a Bernie\nAgain another he'll be close to eighty years old I think right if he runs a year we can lead hum I don't know you John Delaney is\nA comedian is it now keep going robbed and winning a Christian Gillibrand either that was um ... are in a sari Eric Garcetti\nDog with them then just mayor yeah your handsome to Whitney yeah he's ... he's the son of the other guy said you know gill\nA former U.S attorney general Eric Holder\nOh boy he would be a horror ... they have so much crap on India\nAnd then ah Julian Castro from San Antonio that'd be cool to have another Texas guy in there\nI bet you they run you know I bet you they run on already Booker I'm Elizabeth Warren And Julian Castro I bet you does the top three when\nWe're all going to see another thing in here about 'em or possibly a file a ...\n... who are ...\nThey want him to run the job he's a lawyer for a porn star\nYeah\nWhat ... you know why as favorable how is that faces I don't know\nBecause I Know the name oh okay yeah I Know you either way I'm either way they're going to lose because [laughter] because you are they ah they haven't come up they didn't they haven't come up with anybody yet to to go up against Trump\nDid you see a a richer link letters add\nAn adult I heard about it I heard about it it uh but then didn't ooh so it was by a superPAC yeah paid for it and then Beto came out and said I don't like super facts yes [laughter]\nIt was such a good ad yeah his old man and a coffee shop saying that if Donald Trump would have said X Y and Z about me and my family and my wife I'd had given them I'd have been really tough like Texas and suck them in the mouth and taking them behind the woodshed and what does that uh-huh\nAnd that was the whole commercial and you're like that's a hard old man yeah and you're like alright that's something to think about because I think a lot of people had that on their mind they're like Ted you never said anything and then I've also heard the other side of the\nPicture of him on the phone well I've heard I've heard\nI've heard the other side of the argument saying Ted's being the bigger man and dropping grants yeah state of Texas and it's like okay I can kind of see that I guess mhm\nBut you know I kind of want to believe that if someone said that about me and embarrassed me and you know on national TV it made me stop running for president which the one thing I wanted to do my entire political career [laughter] I'd ... I'd have words but again secret services involved and weren't going to get near the\nGuy yadda yadda yadda but it would be nice if you could just address it anyways it's it was such a good ad and it was so simple and well done but then that came out and said that he doesn't like tax\n[laughter]\nIf there's a you know it was unfortunate to say that I Want to record said he's a nice guy\nWho better yeah I've never met him like he's cool like he's nice you know like he believes in what he's doing sure\nBut it's sort of one of those things where it's like so it was Ted Cruz though you've got to his fans are annoying his fans are really annoying but so are the hard like if you really like a band but then you're just like I don't want to go to the concert because they don't want to see the ... the but I Am\nI think it's that way everywhere mhm everybody's fans are annoying everyone's super fans are annoying yeah like George Springer super fans are unknown J J what super fans are annoying mhm I don't\nThey're annoying as they are around ... who you said that not in the local journalist apologizes for true to comment true on one show it's true\nOr or yeah or like because like I cannot go to bed or rallies like it's it's against my ...\nMy religion as a reporter sure like I'm not supposed to do that kind of ... I made retweet weird things you're supposed to go to the rally to cover that but I Can't go and be like well ... up on stage at school right I mean I Can't do that that guy from arcade fire or and so like I always kind of feel like\nI feel like people\nLike I haven't been invited to see those things that I Know that part of it is people are going well yeah Craig probably can't go because of blah blah blah\nAnd also I think people will go I'm not going to invite Craig but he 'cause he is not one of us I like the times I get like ... for not being a liberal that like I'm missing out on cool things like I missed it out on cool like you know\nMarches protests and stuff because I have other things to do and people like oh we're not going to ask you to go to the\nTo the to the desert protest because he's not going to want to go I kind of respect for him to talk like that are highly\nI respect Ted Cruz a little bit more because he doesn't want to have stupid contracts\nWith the yeah there are a but I mean if he had a stupid concert\nI don't think you wouldn't be very good but I don't think he would no I Would if you ran the idea buy me like I said look\nWe're from Texas who would you get yet we can get all these Texas read their music maybe people out and maybe you could you know do those guys wouldn't play that yes they would know they would not salute leave I you know absolutely they would I don't think any of those guys yes they ... play it\nYes they what he could bring in national country acts to play well national guys for sure well that's what I'm saying he could definitely do that but I don't think he would be able to bring anybody I don't think he would love all that just like I don't want to piss anybody off I don't think you would have a concert now it's true it's really tacky\nIt's entertaining so I Do because I think people are going to watch the concert and then he comes out there like he's like the the\nBut the second to last activists just like your sample or me and I'm going to be nice let's talk we're lazy yeah yeah well I've been out for far he's a nice guy or just to the fans are annoying mhm and I like how people were crying and screaming that they're getting their science taken away you know our neighborhoods\nTo close the show our friend Charles Adams said that his lovely wife Kathy made a great assumption or a great observation about ... though he has great ideas but he failed to produce reasons are are the ways he's going to achieve said ideas he's like the kid running for student council that promise macaroni\nAnd cheese everyday right and all the pizza toppings you could have NO PLAN who's going to pay for that I don't know exactly who knows\nThere's been a good show and it has like I'm awake
