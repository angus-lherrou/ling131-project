I think that McConnell\nHas enough arrows in his quiver 'em to compel flake and ... Collins and Murkowski to\nVote yes like I don't know if it's carrots or stick right now but I think you can get the whips them into it I think that the left has kinda pushed the Republicans are corner that they can't lose this level of face now I don't know the impact on the midterms\nRight and I think that's a key factor in his because if you look at it you know there's this big rush to push cabin or through the ...\nWe don't have to stall it till mid term saw ... other Democrat\nBut I mean there was no Adam and see for this when when um Merrick Garland yeah when he you know they kept deposition before a year but\nBut here's the thing so it's the president's right to nominate descendants fried chicken from and they use the McConnell used per se you know salad a procedural mechanisms\nTo edit from really the president's right because they didn't really led Obama have the right\nOne I'm saying you know well he did a point them but the Senate refused to confirm it right okay but I when people conflate marriage with Brett my problem is that he wasn't pilloried liked is they just procedurally and if the Democrats control the executive in the Senate\nShe would have gone right through and I think George Carlin would've been a good judge I think judge count as I think the buffalo to activists on either side of the spectrum break but I don't think either of them are horrible choice as\nWell as opposed to the Democrats need if they want to a point and\nConfirm they need to reconnect with their base in winning the Senate we\nNeed better candidates right from this party and I I Will go on the record by saying this is that we're very very concerned about everything\nExcept having a viable candidate to run against this president in two thousand and twenty that's

Syria or the greater picture of the middle east is the Iranians are the Israelis the Russians and then the western forces and are we even are we doing a coordinated for us right now with our European allies well\nAre some French forces in Syria and a few other group very small numbers but mainly we're pretty much on our own but in working\nIn conjunction not integrated and you know and um we still have the issue of on top that the Iranians Syrians are threatened to attack um what what is on top of all time is that based on the southern part of the Syrian border down by Iraq that has basically stopped using that area for a land bridge for Iran go into Lebanon\nAnd so it's very strategic but we have a lot of our power there how ... and other things uh it's amazing how much of the French have quite a bit of artillery in Syria now which is you know I'm a\nYou know proven it's worth you know within distance\nOr you're a are any European forces in Iraq right now no art we\nYes moderately moderately but see their the anti American sentiment is there and there has been some pull back\nA bull back on our part ripple back on their part are part because of the uh basically Iran is taking over that government the anti American sentiment started as soon as the majority of ISIS was posed out ... a push down in Iraq last year but\nI I thought that it becomes sort of an anti Iranian a sentiment within that country and I didn't realize you were still gaining political clout well\nIn the government is anti American because of Iranian influence but the due to Iranian Shia PM you hedge money uh an abused the people are rising up a lot of um Arabs now some of the Shias in fact we had a lot of protests still going on\nAnd just recently we had a human rights activists was shot at a rally that was probably by somebody from the ... which is the Iranian religious place\nA and so what is going on in Iran they've had some uh upheaval in economic distress within their own borders well one of the things that just came out a little while ago\nUm you know that they have the big ... un meeting in New York I'm a Khamenei doesn't want to talk to a Trump but apparently they came out and spoke and basically said we're going to support our efforts in Syria Lebanon and Yemen\nAnd what's ironic they always denied that had influence in Yemen becoming let that slip out oh really yeah and uh it looks like they're the currency is going to implode is right now we are as of today we have that will tanker drivers strike uh uh we\nHad the shooting last week at ... which was a military parade in four people supposedly tied to ISIS ISIS had pictures of them but\nIt they didn't claim to be part of ISIS went up and shot a parade and shot or killed twenty three people I ... so right now Iran is in the midst of this massive pick up picking up hundreds of people\nAre trying to track down all these cells that may be tied to ISIS ISIS has always said from day one they wanted to take down Iran and it had small elements there but because of the high unemployment around thirty nine percent taking a water resources from people they can't get electricity and everything and it you know\nAnd the cost of living he keeps skyrocketing ... that the the the ... of everyday Iranian or middle class on down is having a very hard life and tired of it because they see the upper ... or do you see the patches living good and buying all this stuff and they are censored dine\nOregon pickled sardines and very mackerel\nHuh All right so what about Yemen a Saudi Arabian conflict going on there with the healthy well it's still going on\nAnd it's amazing ah\nYou know uh as as much territory ... he's taken\nThe healthy stole straight back with ballistic missiles are in drones and stuff like that I'm really surprised the price of oil has not gone up due to some of the naval drones and uh that the healthy things have used against a Saudi oil tankers ...\nSo a ballistic missiles are still flying periodically\nIt's a war of attrition is probably one of the big us humanitarian disasters created by war that we've seen in ages because the Saudis last year's been taken all the infrastructure uh from hospitals to water treatment or\nTo uh taken over the ports because the fishing boats were bringing in weapons for years but\nUh so speaking of countries are fractured by a war and sat in civil unrest Libya\nAll we'll all we've got a big firefight going off and on and Tripoli today over a hundred or think dead so far in the last couple of days a call now is to bring in the un and the thing is what's going on here cannot be solved by the un\nIf it did if it was cable being solved with the UN UN would've been um let's say functional long time ago\nSo we do have a lot of different foreign elements Libya uh basically we have a struggle for control and half our has the upper hand but you still have elements ISIS al ...\nAnd then basically the traveling units that are are still trying to serve their control gets a piece of oil revenue pie now Libyan oil production is back up and Libya is seeking to get a lot of investment there but they still can't keep it staple enough uh\nOverall for all the oil production so we have a presence um the Italians and the French or an hour odds or control there so it's turned back into another almost colonial ask general ... was\nOf the three ... areas he was the heir apparent and he was getting weapons from\nRussia and I said did he ever get them he's got a little bit but not all he's been promised why\nThe Russians failed to a complete that and solidify power there is it in their insisted that it'd be unrest well\nAt the moment I kind of wondering because it looks like the Russians really stockpiling for their benefit\nAnd you know for years last couple of years I've been stockpiling Syria they have more than enough for Syria to help half tar and uh they spread around a little uh ... rubles would go a long way to get a lot more fighters\nHave to or has probably the best chance because um he has a strong leader however he uh doesn't necessarily have the support for all the factions and it would have to be a um\nA unifier to really bring peace and that's why some people looking for ... son has a unifier but half our will never accept it so until who won force comes in and implement a\nHeavy handed peace I don't see it happening for for years are going to have a couple of kids you can send down there yeah and actually turkey has a little bit of a in the game they're already alone with Egypt\nOr Libya is still the jumping off point for the majority of the immigrants are refugees that are landing on the Italian ...\nStarting to move over a little bit to the west easier now it's becoming the new prime jump off stop because everything else and what's interesting now is the amount of cells from Morocco to Algeria and Tunisia that\nWe're getting a found out a man you know because ISIS had the signs of Northern Africa being under their control a but ISIS is still there even though I'm right now they're strongest areas or Afghanistan in Yemen\nOkay a Saudi Arabia a under the uh the rise of sell them on ... uh the ... of the I guess and gender restrictions and\nUm so I was ... you know I thought that ... was ironic uh Egypt is it kind of a volatile economic situation but they also have a huge asset out in the Mediterranean they can develop for gas natural gas she's working with the talents and stuff like that\nA\nCc's trying to work with Saudi Arabia and cooperation and everything else but then of course you do have the\nUh ... revolution it's still there that would basically was part of the Muslim Brotherhood Arab Spring every spring was nothing but a Muslim Brotherhood ... operation to seize power for all these countries right and uh so\nEgypt now is more in the camp of Russia and they've been doing it lots of training exercises mine Russian gear and a jet so at the moment they're kinda they're willing to work with Israel but then also cc's having to work very fine line with what everything that he does\nA another more recent a voice of reason over there or was the the king of Jordan ... of Jordan\nYeah well he's been having the kingdom of Jordan to have lots of financial problems he's facing a insurrection internally and some from his own family and stuff but recently uh\nIMF gave him another loan things have kinda stabilized for that but in in the day ... is the protector of the Temple Mount for an and allowed the co of worship above his role in uh the Jews\nUh but he's under a lot of pressure to eliminate any Jewish influence on the Temple Mount from some of his supporters\nUh whether you can pitch lights and not that well yet to be same I feel like there was something left on that scab that is a president or to God and turkey is we moved on earlier was there something else there well yes I'm Glad you notice Dave\nUh Oregon is kind of guy right before you had a meaning he's gonna try to do something to get your attention so like last time that ... of Greece met before the NATO summit he kinda did\nAll military a maneuver that kind of ruffled feathers in\nGreece but this time he's gone ahead sees some islands out the GNC so up to twelve islands and um some airports that weren't taking any military traffic in the area now have about a hundred and fifty fighter stationed there\nSo he is airports right yeah so he basically one of the things is in play is this big gas field right off of Cyprus that I'm Cyprus would like to have Exxon or somebody develop but at the same time if he controls violence is going to throw a lot of access to anything going to Cyprus [noise]\nSo uh some similar to what the Chinese have done in the south China Sea are\nVying for operational ... control of an area right so these were uninhabited rocky islands that are now being a now have\n... on them so basically what you know and Everytime already gone does something like this he sets up listening post as Ford intelligence and things like that but you know this is a volatile relationship they've had ... back in the seventies they had the wolves\nA spat over Cyprus were part is now Turkish control part is separate control a\n... if it's already gone in Turkey itself a sit precarious really in their relationship to the ear you NATO\nAnd then of course the Arab world right in Russia now ... with the inclusion of Russia and they are a and cooperative terms with the Russians well\nThere's a big change happen this last week now Russian jets military jets flying directly over turkey before they would take the route through Iran and back to Iraq over now they're flying directly over turkey because of this high level of cooperation that really opened up after the invitation to Vostok\nA twenty Eighteen that just happened a couple of weeks ago so what is Vostok twenty your dad was the massive military operation from the words of Finland to all the way to China\nWith the Chinese and the Russians ... wasn't it wasn't a wasn't a turkey that refused to let our bombers fly over their airspace other way to Afghanistan post nine eleven yes we didn't forget\nYeah and uh and of course now they're still the threat of arresting military officers that the U.S there ... and um\nThe threat of a Russian military offers as a in that failed coup attempt no these\nAre the ones that were actually engaged in training the G hottest rebels against aside\nFrom a\n... a YDF for the YPG\nOr a well it was OK well one of the big problems we had we had the CIA fund a supporting one group the Pentagon was supporting another group and the ... to some of the SDF but some other stuff\nAnd we when we do stuff like that it's not that we're up to say we're aware right\nWell we're we're area somebody is yet there were some as where if not the CIA that maybe the George ... yeah well people are aware especially the trainers on the ground they have to deal with these guys and all this stuff can pretty much all they are but they're there to do a job not to make judgments about the endgame\nTurkey was making demands for ... travel for his as citizens throughout the European Union is not he would unleash Eighteen million refugees\nUprisings across Europe where do we end up in that covers say well at the moment\nUh Europe is trying to take a moderate approach that it's kind of up now on I'm On hold\nAnd that's one of the things is like a turkey has close to Seventeen million people in uh Europe that could respond so called already gone to

fifty eight twenty easier drummer nine one one garage door service dot com or gas bill Powell it is in Tel over watch we're stuck navigating the globe a and we were talking about the Russians are muscles are talking about the Chinese a\nBunch of fun stuff was Ian company as in comrades uh this last week the Des Moines register had an advertising supplement you know a China is buying a their soybeans from South America due to the trade war\nOr the comic con that makes a comment about his fund days in Iowa and a Beijing can send an example for this world\nAnd it was an ad in the Des Moines paper right it was kind of like a was a kind of pull ... out there create a little descent and so we do our usual divide and conquer mallet used to do something very similar when he started out you go into the villages get the women upset and take over the village [laughter]\nSo you're calling the the people in Des Moines a bunch of women know they have and then say they accepted the propaganda and that's what's interesting last week is that a U.S a made some of the Chinese news agencies or a or\nA sign up as being a foreign entities at to stop some of the propaganda\nSo basically said just being free serving news agencies they have to register as foreign agents well\nTo that end in Des Moines somebody had to accept payment for those uh\nWill print media is struggling right now will take any advertising money they can get\nIncluding advertising for a alternative news sources [laughter]\nThat's right well and that's the whole thing is really in ... but the big deal about this balance of power traits when the U.S and China isn't about the trade\nBasically you know while this trade wars going on in the military is Asian but at the same time\nI find interesting Z is being so aggressive against the various religious denominations in China China has never been for ... a religious denominations but however he's going after every body but basically ah we see the rise disease power\nI the control aspect you can't have competing philosophies and this new version of um\nA blend of communism fascism\n[laughter] which is what they want for us here in America right the third wave as well I think what they call it that way\nBy by uh so uh we were talking earlier about the fragility of certain nations um like the mother dollar but their currency ah and I know that in the past China has struggled to prop up the young\nUh what is the status of that currency right now in the global markets a you\nKnow it's interesting there's one rate for outside of China different rate inside but they're still having to prop it up and Z has promised he will keep it propped up at all costs and uh in a situation where they can do it for quite a long time\nBut that's the whole thing is this is the irony of that control aspect yes it makes things some some things more efficient yet the same time and actually creates more issues and what's interesting is the fact that Xi's father was the head of one of the regents that China they had a a kind of the size of Australia that really\nWas a dynamic leader these different regions of China acting independently actually created dynamic for growth in China that will now be stifled\nBut that's the whole thing about a man ... yes you can manage it to a point that reaches a point where they're supposed to manage becomes a manageable and so they have their issues with the stock market they had the issues with the bad debt but that is why are they will continue to maintain\nA efforts to buy oil from the cheapest source and uh also\nUh expand so but what's interesting is out in the Pacific and Indian Ocean with Maltese and say Shelley's they're starting to lose their political clout\nReally and the people are starting to see what's going on\nSo from the Silk Road initiative right well also basically because they come and build that get very ... and that's the lesson Paul that they have yet to learn is you move in and then you start taking over and then you start treating the locals free a threat to poorly\nYes a a a lesson that many cultures have learned a those conquerors a need to figure out how to\nSimulates the conquer ease\nYes be aware of easy term loans from a benevolent ah [laughter] what are the fluid flighty\nRate punch up built a so as we talk about the China we always have to talk about the thorn in all of our side and that's North Korea Oh yes\nWell you know the denuclearize Asian ever occur wallets of this recent meeting with moon and kill them\nAnd a leader of north and South Korea out of the leaders of north and South Korea it was interesting when they had this meeting and there was no South Korean flags and moon did not say anything about South Korea being a legitimate government\nOr the mindset has always been in South Korean education diploma and everything they are the legitimate government of North Korea but what's weird is now already in the educational system in South Korea they're taking away the phrase that South Korea is a legitimate government since the seventies\nI think it became about mid seventies the north Koreans were gauge in a\n... to get with the south Korean intelligence yeah if I buy unification\nOr even ... who did that stupid gang style dance yeah he was ... proponent of it ah for this unification at all costs but what is strange that South Korea is the economic power the one with the tax and everything else is willing to ... to him\nIt's like you just made yourself a lower than Kim who will be in control when you you know you will lose everything if you allow that to\n... talking about this before the benefits for the reunification of north and South Korea certainly don't put a lot of a pluses in the south Korean call\nNo they don't
