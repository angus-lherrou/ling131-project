competition receiving the GOP nomination for congressional district to to replace head pope\nA lot of people said that he wasn't going to even make it into a runoff he did and he won the runoff that being said\nYeah he does face in opponents but the interesting thing is that he is addressing the needs and concerns of congressional district too\nWhich is from the east side of town all the way to the west side of town in an odd district drawn but interestingly enough of a district that was heavily affected by Hurricane Harvey and we're talking about ways to address that\nIt's a little bit of ... matter of engineering how do we funded I liked the direction we're going right now it's always moving a little bit too slowly but I have a very detailed plan\nUm strategy that we put out and you know what the full knowledge that it's ever changing I talk a lot about this and what are you supposed to do from Congress\nSo I look at what legislation like you know water resource development actor and can we are getting real nerdy here but this is exactly what you need to look at what committees I Would beyond actually I'm past that kind of legislation which authorize Army Corps of engineers projects\nThat that's really important to does your military\nBackground give you a little bit more of an asset or advantage there it it does so I mean because after I got hurt I had a kind of a different career okay and it was it was it was less leading men in combat a lot more in a working across federal agencies putting in broader strategic plans I'm very used to working with with different federal agencies and we're used to working with the army\nWhether it's the Army Corps of engineers or regular army\nSaying I speak the language and I'm In what I Do understand is that listen bureaucracies but obstacles in your way and then it's your job to say okay tell me the obstacles so that I can sell because I have the power to solve those obstacles for you while you're you know is there a bureaucrat generally says well I Can't do it I Can't do it and here's why\nI say okay got it those are the reasons let's break down those reasons 'cause he's I'm supposed to have the power to do that and let's get this done I mean and so that's that's how I look at it and it's working together it's cooperating with local um you know city county state federal let's get this done who's the senior member of the\nTexas delegation of Republicans or governors [noise]\nI don't I Know of so as well so we gotta we gotta lotta corner and we got a lot of the ... the senior right editors\nA eyesight so have you begun to get assuming that we make it the ... have you got to kind of get the lay of the land and figure out what you're going to need to do what you're I mean it sounds like you're already working on a plan of action to serve your district\nYeah no I'm definitely in contact with house leadership um I I've committed trying to raise money for house leadership I'm not specifically for them but for members who are in trouble right so I had to you know keep Texas read nation read that's that's that's that I'm working on to run in our campaign or also are already\nAre trying to do more for the party [noise] um [noise] you know we we've got a lot of great leaders from the Texas delegation particular alright uh [noise] you know a chairman of multiple committee so [noise] you know Kevin Brady um Mac Thornberry or Pete Sessions all chairman committee\nAnd I and missing a couple actually but Texas is very strong and now we ... we work with\nWriter before he seems like a a ups in a guy ... seem very accessible um [noise]\nNot not asking you to speak to a the race for the book the Texas senator race [noise]\nBut I wanted you to comment um [noise]\nI find it interesting that there's a lot of outside rallying\nFor this upstart democratic challenger him making appearances on a like late night talk shows and is it that sort of an orthodox and what are the voters think about that or is that more of a a a long game I'm a grooming him but he's his handlers are\nAffecting well I think what you're\nWhat you're observing is is is this shift at the Democratic party the liberal coastal elites and they went when I say that I Know it kind of just sounds like rhetoric\nBut it's it's fundamental Nasr a\nIt's fundamentally true so it's it's not surprising that a guy like him\nHe's charismatic he seems like a fun guy [noise] um it's it's not surprising and he's very liberal so any ... you know to his credit he's very honest about how ... really is a Kevin that because there's a lot there's not enough that all that there's a lot of candidates running in Texas on the Democratic side who really mass how far left they are thrown in there that if they give the sort of um [noise]\n... you know did they give this meant but they're very middle of the road and well they are they talking about you know common sense pragmatism whose common sense and pragmatic for him like you know in that and that's why it's important to take a stand on issues it really is and I hear on your on your underlying principles\nAnd the foundations that you approach governance\nRight I'll give it to a beta or at least he does that\nAll right but and and so it's it's very obvious to me why he might be popular with again you're liberal coastal elites who says what they want to see in Texas is a huge target and they can turn Texas they can turn everything\nBut I had kept saying I ... through well apathy among lays but it is it like there's this predominant\nOh let's turn this into this liberal state a bit by a empty the coffers and put everybody on the test that that isn't a pervasive sentiment of the country so the only thing that could see a tied to blue or to a purple would be apathy or laziness on the part of the the the conservative base\nYou're probably right and and I don't think it's working in Texas to be clear you know ... the last poll had there is a nine point so ... and it's not likely to change very much and I think most ... voters are decided at this point [noise] uh the cabinet effect Israel and um and I and a lot a lot of voters were upset by how the Democrats approach that entire\nHearing and just as we go into that forever but that that that's really help it last and a Cruz's campaign Harding as he needs to get out there with the people are and that's what he's doing and we'll just we'll see more of that [noise]\nI was a chagrin to read the story about how he and his wife or a ... a while they were out trying to eat the the the video no I did terrible\nIs that it it's the new normal you know it\nIf if if conservative act that way or the the swift reaction would be studying the fact that this is tolerated accepted and Maxine Waters says you need to go find these conservatives where they where they where they shop in and tell them\nThat's that to me is a lack of civil tea is supposed to a simplified our our political dialogue I'm supposed to be civil about we're supposed to be a ladies and gentlemen were supposed to have this course and that's what this country was founded on now we've got shouting matches and and and the bullying and civilization\nAnd and it's it's it's really frustrating to see 'em you know we we call them mobs and then the mainstream media well I mean I see it I mean I'm not you know I don't I don't I don't quote far less media right I only quote mainstream media are they I don't think it's effective to to quote the other side's worst arguments okay\nBe and you know and right you know and and and that's the the double standard is is is what's I think is frustrating to so many conservative of because we're told that well you're a mob to no no no I mean words matter okay definitions matter\nActions matter so let's let's have a real discussion about this a Trump rally they call that a mob okay well the Trump rallies inside a building they're not attacking anybody All right yeah they sound very boisterous [laughter]\n... and various news you know I'm the first one to get that moon when the president said hey knock him out you know yeah don't say that\nThat's fine it's you know let's let's be honest like let's let's let's condemn that but now given that was a couple of years ago and this is now the U.S condemn this also this is not okay\nEverybody everybody's defenses that someone else is doing something worse like that somehow makes the action okay and I guess that that's where the frustration comes and\nIt's like we need parents to come in and go okay wait he did at first it doesn't matter who go to your body and your room at the end of the day you're going to battle for the people in your district\nAnd trying to help them out [noise] and that's a good\nThing congressional district number two uh is it it's a strong red district\nI I I Would say so uh it's it's it's um assessed that are eleven so Ted Poe wanted was sixty percent of the vote last election and uh we're hoping to keep that her beat that\nSo and they have\nReal uh issues and concerns in the coming years as she talked about recovery still from from Hurricane Harvey er and to that and uh it's not just about the recovery it's about preventing the impact mitigating the except for next time uh and I believe that your your district as on is it a couple of the some of the the eastern part of the city\nSo some of the run off that we saw from up north\nLake Houston yes like you and that was a district and that was what happened there\nYou know it was the same thing with addicts decisions had to be made but if it might district has addict and like Houston oh that that's what I say some of the hardest ...\nNovel up all that that is absolutely a focal\nPoint I don't have a question for you is there any other campaign stop so you'd be making sale [noise]\nBoy we're all over the place so we we try to spread it out between kind in the northwest northeast and inside the loop though I mean my district goes all the way down to Rice University it sneaks up to the heights in spring branch and addicts and spring and champions or then it goes east a humble task casinos\nUsed and draw those on graph paper\nEverybody here at the table and we live all over the\nLine I like to streets outside of his well you could just go guess voted the other district\nIt would draw it would be a felony balls and do not ever do that I had a nice week no\nI Can't wake I've I only have one I\nJust leave it\nThere are going to look at I bet you know\nWhere's the beautiful as Crenshaw today

months every day and he would counsel may\nBe for my show and I did like a one hour show that I got to do our show so he said that every day for six months before and after the show and he basically taught me how to do talk radio but not in his style in my style he would be like this is how I got what they would do it\nAnd he said at the end of six months he goes bam boy\nI thought she was a herd\nBut you are smart you'd take direction well and you're a humble and uh as soon as you've finished leviathan I think will be up to speed\nRead Hobbs or via the coach at all the time and I'm like

politics and that is sort of a public office and hire a and uh it has certainly served as community well he has chosen to not pursue politics anymore I Hope that he did discourage you from doing so\nNow you know he he definitely told me he thought I was going to lose [laughter] yeah I live in a bar but you know next time yeah not everybody told us that\nI mean it was like ... we really like you um you know in this doesn't work out you know well we hope we hope you keep trying does that make the victory little sweeter yeah yeah ... ... we just don't think that way right like I I was never

progress you know district to to replace Ted Poe\nA lot of people said that he wasn't going to even make it into a runoff he did and he won the runoff that being said\nYeah he does face in opponents but the interesting thing is that he is addressing the needs and concerns of congressional district too which is from the east side of town all the way to the west side of town in an odd district drawn\nBut interestingly enough a district that was heavily affected by Hurricane Harvey and we're talking about ways to address that\nIt's a little bit of ... matter of engineering how do we funded I liked the direction we're going right now it's always moving a little bit too slowly but I have a very detailed plan\nUm strategy that we put out and you know with the full knowledge that it's ever changing\nI talk a lot about this and what are you supposed to do from Congress so I look at what legislation like you know water resource development actor and we're getting real nerdy here but this is exactly what you need to look at what committees I Would beyond actually I'm past that kind of legislation which authorize Army Corps of engineers projects that that's really important to\nDoes your military background give you a little bit more of an asset or advantage there it it does so I mean because after I got hurt I had a kind of a different career okay and it was it was it was less\nLeading men in combat a lot more in a working across federal agencies putting in broader strategic plans I'm very used to working with with different federal agencies and we're used to working with the army whether it's the Army Corps of engineers or regular army saying I speak the language and I'm In what I Do understand is that listen bureaucracies but obstacles in your way\nAnd then it's your job to say okay tell me the obstacles so that I can sell because I had the power to solve those obstacles for you while you're you know is that if you're a bureaucrat generally says well I Can't do it so I Can't do it and here's why\nI say okay got it those are the reasons let's break down those reasons 'cause\nHe's I'm supposed to have the power to do that and let's get this done I mean and so that's that's how I look at it and it's working together it's cooperating with local um you know city county state federal let's get this done who's the senior member of the Texas delegation of Republican governors [noise]\nI don't I Know it was so as\nWell so we gotta we gotta lotta corner and we're not a lot of the ... the senior right editors a ... so have you done to get assuming that we make the ... have you begun to kind of get the lay of the land and figure out what you're going to need to do what you're I mean it sounds like you're already working on a plan of action to serve your district\nYeah now I'm definitely in contact with house leadership um I I've ...\nTo try and raise money for house leadership I'm not specifically for them but for members who are in trouble right so I took you know keep Texas read [noise]\nKeep the nation read that that that's that I'm working on to run in our campaign but we're also we're already\nAre trying to do more for the party [noise] um [noise] you know we we've got a lot of great leaders from the Texas delegation particular All right uh you know a chairman of multiple committee so Kevin Brady um Mac Thornberry a Pete Sessions alternative committed [noise] and I and missing a couple actually but Texas is very strong when do we ... we\nWork with ready before he seems like a a ups in a guy ... seem very accessible [noise] um [noise]\nNot not asking you to speak to a the race for the ... the Texas senator race [noise]\nBut I wanted you to comment um [noise]\nI find it interesting that there's a lot of outside rallying\nFor this upstart democratic challenger\nHim making appearances on a like late night talk shows and is it that sort of an orthodox and what are the voters think about that or is that more of a a a long game I'm a grooming but he's his handlers are affecting well I think what you're\nWhat you're observing is this is the shift at the Democratic party the liberal coastal elites and they went when I say that I Know it kinda just sounds like rhetoric\nBut it's it's fundamental Nasr a fundamentally true so it's it's not surprising that a guy like him he's charismatic he seems like a fun guy um it's it's not surprising and he's very liberal so and and you know to his credit he's very honest about how liberal is a Kevin that\nBecause there's a lot there's a lot of math that all that there's a lot of candidates running in Texas on the Democratic side who really mask how far left they are right and then they they give the sort of um [noise]\n... you know do they give this meant but the very middle of the road as well they are they talking about you know common sense pragmatism whose common sense in pragmatic for him like you know in that and that's why it's important to take a stand on issues it really is they can and I hear on your on your underlying principles and and the foundations that you approach governance\nRight I'll give it to bed or at least he does that All right but ... and so that it's very obvious to me why he might be popular with again you're liberal coastal elites that's what's that's what they want to see in Texas is a huge target and they can turn Texas they can turn everything\nBut I didn't go ahead Ken they don't do well apathy in my legs but it it it is it like this is predominant\nOh let's turn this into this liberal state a and and and write a empty the coffers and put everybody on the ... that that isn't a pervasive sentiment of the country so the only thing that could see a tide of blue or it's a purple would be apathy or laziness on the part
