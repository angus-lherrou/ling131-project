S. I Want to go into Europe I Want to go into China and then you can pay those costs later on 'cause that's expensive hurting it about a thousand dollars\nJust to entry fees per country\nSo if you're like I Want to get a pat and those three countries you know it might cost you a thousand person going to take a lot of race that kind of money but in the meantime you're selling for two and a half years you've been selling and if your thinking wow this is something that this is only like ... I cannot lose this this is my major product line sure this process is worth his weight in gold\nOkay but if you're if you're looking at this thinking well it's selling All right I don't know that I'd actually when it tried to sue somebody in China over it's just too expensive sure then don't bother\nSo let me ask a question that if I understood you ride if you have a product that you made and you're showing that maybe to a big farm in Texas which in all farm Halliburton or somebody like that and you've you've discovered that\nListening to them this is very unique nobody else on the market as that is to light you've already so too is that right\nYou have a one year grace period so if you start showing the Halliburton tomorrow you have up to one year to try to file for a patent apple ... application interesting stuff up you know where we're at a time though a child's law William child's\nPHD a chemistry attorney patent attorney child's patent law dot com is website thank you very much for joining us they very informative unfortunately that has all the time we have we are going to go get smart on something else brings a whole bunch more\nNext week in the meantime or go to Texas business radio dot com see the entire thing and beautiful ... video get your questions in a by phone by ... by Twitter we don't care how you get 'em and go ahead and get 'em in for next week we're going to get experts in here to get those questions answered\nA same time same place next week we'll see them\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThank you lose named today says this radio or you can see the entire show is beautiful age ... dot com and don't forget next week\nI hear media\nTechnical term your video production company pardon me if you are not going to happen when you're trying to be out your competitor and contact them now are aren't you a media that come and see how easy it is to get started aren't you a media dot com R.
