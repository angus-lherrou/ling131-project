big concert\nAnd why and when you talk about that they just don't give us bother it is limited because of the amount of space but you guys actually build that stage every or is that a state because what if you build that said every year\nAnd it's it's a it's a max it's already gotten into the restaurant and it's at max so that's why we went down there now make up the ante with the acts you know the broader acts are going to start coming in\nIn uh we're we've got some exciting stuff going on\nBut over the years this thing has more to include everything from a biker or build off which I think the one going online or they're just like right now\nThere is there's that and there's the emotion event where you got to ride your bike in it's got to be written in so have you with that is so in motion were given out ten thousand dollars this year to ah the builder with the with the best buy it's been written in and I think that there's not many I mean it's probably I don't know [noise]\nAre

about it there's a couple of other bill last in the car shows\nWith his car and truck shows 'cause I Know that the Chevy Truck dealer robot over the last year the year before that kind of am stuff

all around the world for this\nI'd sell the bill B. runs a organized ride especially a Thursday and friday for people that come out early looking for something to do\nRight that is something new we're doing the show really is a throwback to the motorcycle we're trying to focus on the motorcycle parts the motor some it's it's really it's really gone back to that\nYou got along star rally this was a

A. R. R. to or such right we had to leave home we have to add an hour because I'm not that good of a golfer\nUh LA twenty five dollars a portion of those tickets those sales go directly to the charity they'll summers association it's up in that kind of been on our mind uh over the past couple of years I Know that it has touched the lives of people around us serving up we've stepped up and done a myriad of events\nJust earlier this week we were talking about ah and I and I told him about part as we were talking about there's actually a dementia caregivers a seminar going on November the third ah it is something that affects more and more people\nAre I guess the problem is that we don't have the multigenerational well living situation you used to be your your your your mom for your grandmother but I ended up living with your show\nThe kids are great you all help out you know now that people are more independent and and unless the coldest together as somebody ages and they end up facing dementia and or Alzheimer's it changes the dynamic and it it increases\nUh the the the burden and I'd go to use that word but it is a burden because if it changes your lifestyle I should be a burden that you should welcome to the price but the reality is\nPeople are structured to deal with this so there is money needed not only to continue the research for all summer's failed but then a five but also to educate and offer support and assistance and resources for people that are they live with us prior to that is what we get through the through the through the also Evers association\nYeah and you're right it's touched everybody I think everybody that you talk to you would have some story about either a friend or a rowing right exact I've seen it personally my father in law uh and it it is it's devastating [noise] uh and and there are resources\nAvailable but you have this wonderful also Evers association which has become this touchstone are not only do they bombed the drug research and try to figure out how to combat or identify and and health of mitigated\nBut you also have the resources or you could get help through Social Security a there is hospice care a there's a lot involved then we also have associates kind of a catch all umbrella now I'm going to tell you [noise]\nWe get a charity ride for 'em and I wasn't in charge of it but they called it the ride to remember which I thought was\nThe most inappropriate name but the also is that they loved it because that you you have to have a sense of humor or when you're dealing with lies adversity ah and certainly a sense of humor is always native and that's why we have a comedian on the show [laughter] uh so uh Gary you started this a\nMore than half a decade ago er and you've had a different charities each year what was the original impetus to\n... ... you know we actually just started out with a jam session quite honestly you know it was just to get get together with some guys in place of music place in Rockies by some classic music [noise]\nAnd uh it just kind of morphed into just more than that my wife will tell you it morphed into a lot more than a half\nOr because of the scale of it and leave [laughter] that's right yeah she said you know the lighting and they're in a in the music and everything but you know we live music we were we find music back in high school and the and the band that I'm an ... year\nWhen we play it's a three of the original guys that were in the band and now and we just have such a good time it's camaraderie and go get there we get to have good good fun and and everybody that comes has a good time and and wants to come back and that's great because then that way\nThe more we can raise or\nWhatever charity where yeah looking for looking into for that particular year the more we can raise the more we can get\nAll these bands of fireworks are all it is it books or Texas where is it that actually held so\nIt's actually at the airport in rupture so it's an FM three sixty two\nIt's a forty four o seven sport flyers lane good are you gotta do is just go to our fest dot com or you can go to ... tickets dot com either one of those again as you said two hours in the park and uh and then the of good is not a scratch golfers that's right I'm not definitely okay\n... court is a staunch Republican they would never agree to anything of course everything would be a stalemate nothing will change forever yeah but\nThe other cool thing is that all the people that voted for Bayh though\nWould\nFigure out that he doesn't run the state\nYeah we're talking about this view weeks ago he is not the governor right and it's it's Abbott that does those things correct in his people correct so ...\nAs much as senator can do a lot sooner does a lot of things it's a it's a really you know it's an important job we need these yes but he's not going to be able to do things on a molecular level like they want right and when you tell people that\nThey yell at you and call you the devil and say where's your make America great again hat and why do you hate me ... doesn't want me to pay high college tuition\nBut who's going to pay for it who he can't he can't take that away\nThat it's not in charge of that no just like Obama was in charge of that no no it's a\nSomebody said this past week that it sort of like the class president like if somebody is running for class president and by God we're going to have pizza every Monday to friday not just for pizza friday but pizza Monday to because we know Monday the bed\nAnd we're not even have it any homework anymore because ... stupid\nRight that kind of thing right and they can never prove Dennis Miller once had a bit and the bit went like\nThis this Miller is very unsung was ahead of the title learned a lot from him and I still do on his Twitter it's really funny\nHe had a bit once and he said that once you get elected president they sit you in a room and they go congratulations\n... has no was it bill Hicks at a thing where like you would I tell you it's ugly you walk he basically you walk in we can find it probably knows with for Bill Hicks or wasn't ... say the thing we basically\nAnd I have to use act like I'm smoking a cigarette 'cause that's how bill Hicks was ensure you walk in after your elected president and you have like all these crazy ideas and all these things are going to do\nAnd then you walk into a room and there's a guy shadowy guy in the corner and they hand you a folder he goes okay you want to do what now\nAnd you go oh man I'm going to do this abolish this and we're going to legalize this and everything's going to happen\nThis way and it was alright roll tape\nThey didn't like hey roll tape of every like horrible thing that's happened over the past like two hundred years in America in the background story and why this had to happen and why we had to do this when he goes\nAll right so what now what you want to do\nIs like I tell you the same joke you know the exact joke that I was thinking was that you get in the oval office you sit down they congratulate you they pass you on the head and they hand you a folder\nDaily open the folder it shows you exactly what state of a re did at that point in time\nVersus what you thought it was in yeah because you'd never do the worse yeah exactly it's always worse so right that is there a secret service member watchers your entire psyche just crumble\n[laughter] gone it's like it's like a route\nFrom The Simpsons when when he leaves it doesn't like\nIt that way he just said no air and then and then you emerge from\nThe White House yeah and you waved to the people knowing full well there you go back to the Gulf that the only if they are they going to have is golf\nBecause as soon as you go back into that house it is yeah may hamper sucks again exactly that's why presidents golf and leave all the time basically ... to that job that you hate yeah\nYou're like oh God I got to go back to all got out of the time to ask the days be right\nBack so I always try to say that a lot of work it either\nUh yeah but I'm excited that Trump's going because I like Marty excited about the the insanity in the ... of the city at that point because you can have people who are going to complain about traffic well the cops will be stopped in the side of the free out\nYou're gonna have that you're going to have great because you don't know trucks coming in ten because half the people don't pay attention they're all gonna stop here there's a copier ... he's not tracking you\nYeah he's not he's not going to pull you over and so you're going to have like you know the supporters and you're going to have you know the people out there who are going to protest because\nThat's their right they can do that but it's kind of like well what's going to do exactly um but yeah for me him and I like how this week\nThey were people were making fun of him because he has to go to energy arena after he had promised that he was going to get the biggest stadium in Texas for this thing Dallas steady yeah or the other is Kyle Kyle Field would have been bigger oh instead of ATT yard yeah Eighteen the not Dallas so\nAnd I think Eighteen he can is eight is eighty thousand but they can convert it to one hundred thousand like they did for the super bowl because you can get fit people on the field yeah or something they can they can convert something and Kyle Field is has a pretty big thing but what I tried to break it down to people that it's also\nSo yeah we can make fun of him because he said he he we\nHe over shot his coverage right if he was ever going to get something that big for he\nCould just but now ... looking at it from a from a an ethical standpoint versus a logistical standpoint of there is no way we could do this is the president United States you can't have him in a big giant open air thing I'd like to not it'd be a nightmare yeah especially for a stop that's going to take\nMaybe an hour maybe he may be here for an hour\nOr so I mean there was like there's those kind of logistics also he said this in August which is like two men two months out of two months out\nYou can't always just like change with their\nMan can you wait Craig said slow again Jay Jay what was that the Trump rally and there's a picture of him\nThe whole city shaking would ... the whole shitty [laughter] he would have started shaking quake quake in exactly the yeah six ten would just fall apart we wouldn't these brand new beautiful buildings across from us they're not Jay Jay ... proof hurricane proof\nWe wouldn't need to uh we wouldn't need people wouldn't ... even a heat their houses though 'cause they they keeps in the hatred from all of the J J what jerseys being\nBeing burned my urban brand station would take off right which it would take\nJay go and he's got a lot of ideas you guys need to start listening to him more I mean you know he doesn't make a lot of sense of the time but who who among us who just makes sense all the time his teammates would leave him ...\nYeah oh wow that's horrible that is um it's true it's true Craig and you know it's true\nSpeaking of things ... years a jewel with the euro meant for me and that's a it's all for astronomers meant\nFor Jay Jay ... it's going to have a while it's great ... like a way\nIt's like he just ... you just like a describe like a doomsday prophecy like you'd have to like your eyes are on the back of your head like JJ's got to wear a hat\nWould\n\nHave a\nBig fan\nOf
