I don't take that likely I Do thank you for tuning in I think if we didn't do you think you've been watching I thank you for coming up and\nIf you had a woman and she was she was sincere and that there's there's people that you know have different opinions but she seems sincere that something happened to her maybe we aren't sure what happened but something happened and she sees this year about it just is the level of sincerity and that affidavit I and it's and they go into a lot to\nBe a pretty detailed I mean these are things that\nHave been sitting down and do what's come forward apparently oh Mr ... hears that actually made these complaints before but it fell on deaf ears and that's the problem I see what the city of Houston is it they pick and choose who they actually wants to move forward with these types of allegations and I think that's something to fall back into the city council and also the mayor\nBecause this has to ... we have to stop that culture of\nSiding with some whether it's political or not or just friendships\nIf these allegations are not there you got to act on those I mean if not you open yourself to our types of liability and the apartment filled right\nYeah you're right and this and didn't didn't if I remember right reading that affidavit didn't want it for like staffers going to walk in and go oh well I don't want to see this turnaround like yeah he lied right out and\nOpen the door unlocked in and said why oh maybe you trying to get back out of there I mean it's so there's been witnesses to these allegations are the these events\nAnd I'm just shocked and appalled before the Houston Chronicle to come out and say you know we're going to lead the movement and making sure that people have a voice some people who had these allegations they're going to be heard to come out with no hesitation and adores against Phil an on off in a congressional race in CD twenty nine or ... is a it's not ... hairs\nDown hard they could've just to know endorsement either going to just on that they could have said you know well look we're going to be the bigger person\nUh these allegations were Silvio ... they're pretty sincere\nYou know someone ... and it just so good listeners know this is you know the the former county commissioner former state senator Sylvia Garcia what she did is she took off for allegedly which is probably not very legit but anyway she took the ants said hey you know I got a rash to one of her clerks\nYou know ran around in panties one of her one for her another one of her Sampras kind of came in and kind of was freaked out and be lined out of there and just completely harassed this poor girl I mean if I did this type of stuff but at my business or even at the department of education there they'd be all over the news\nThey wouldn't be it would be lost his left them ride all of the news every single media publication in the city would be covering that and again I'm I'm just shocked at that and you don't hope that you know people put politics aside because again this has a lot more weight in this story with specific details and resolve the cabin on\nAnd I hope the Democrats actually hold Sylvia ... Garcia accountable\nAnd there may be some infighting the results from this early voters started on Monday I'm ... and so we'll just have to see on that but with infighting also comes another person when you talk about\nThe term I haven't stopped with our county judge hunker down hunker down and you know last week he came out and endorsed the Democrat\nCandidate for lieutenant governor and there was some\nMinor backlash from some of the candidates down ballot in Harris County the Republican candidates and there hasn't been any backtracked if anything it's been a double down on the statement of saying I said what I said and I met when I said I don't\nKnow how's it going to affect everybody how's it going to affect the courthouses because you know a two thousand eight we saw a huge wipe out two thousand twelve we saw it again and wipe out sixteen another once we sleep every four years younger\nAnd Emmett is just kind of direction it's really the the fault of the local party the\nComplete mismanagement by the local Harris County Republican Party and the arrogance of Ted Cruz\nI and you got to realize that Beto as a result of just under arrogance of Ted Cruz being just you know just elected runs for president\nJust ignores everybody I mean Beto is done a decent job he's not going to win I don't think he's going to win I think it'd be it'd be it'd be surprising if it'd be a shocker\nStranger things have happened but better wouldn't have nearly as much following if Ted Cruz would have done his job and I also been a nice guy and everyone tells me in the Republican Party that surround him and some people do like him and they jump up and down and say we like him but there was a surprising amount of people say he's a jerk I don't want to be around him\nThat if she's not connected to the people he was when he came paid first in two thousand twelve or he's kind of separate himself more of an elitist attitude is what I hear and then I also heard last night had there was a king with Tea Party gathering\nA candidate rally and apparently that was the buzz around the room is anybody going to hold him accountable for this statement and is that going to really hurt the Dow battle judges I think it will I think it will\nI think it'll hurt the judge is but you got to also remember that Lloyd offer heated something similar actually a step back a maybe four years ago whenever he ran for a DNA and the Democrats just kicked him off the ballot\nYou know and and there's been some uh some articles about that by Charles Lane of ... uh they they made some mentioned on this and they're asking people hey what's going to happen here\nOh nothing's going to happen because the image tied in with the local party that's incompetent\nYeah it is it isn't more to come on the air Dick show oh a short segment today we only have a half an hour we got to get some sports programming but I guess it right there will be right back\n... Fox shortly\nVillage builders patio homes from the to a Saturday and Sunday October twenty of money for details that king went online dot com smoking\nAli's affected my daily life because I was a closet smoker it really sort of controlled my entire day my boss is the one that recommended journal cell I decided to give it a try you don't get any of the owner of smoking there's now ask all over your car I Would say give it a try to\nGet the flavor and satisfaction of smoking without domestic cigarette\nAshes for years we recommend them because you need professional help with dealing with the IRS if the Irish says you oh ten thousand dollars or more if you were being honored\nHave years of an file tax returns or you're being issued a wage garnishment our bank Libby you'd need top tax offenders they have the knowledge and experience you need called top tax offenders today at seven won three forty nine seven seven ... seven to one three forty nine seven seven nine to or online top tax defenders dot com speaks\nHis mind you do for holy crap look bad heavy man we if you have a phone or talk to Laurie you better do it because we are going to go into some law and I don't I don't\nWant you guys crying to me because that gave you good advice and your head [laughter] so you better go talk to you know your lawyer before he listed anymore\nAnd I and if they're suffering from any type of home damage car damage a life insurance issues where the cancerous companies just not paying so they called back\nBetter get Dick Dick better get sick and so uh when we left off I mean again this is so much turmoil going on in this world but one thing I Do have to say is uh today's my daughter's fourteen birthday happy birthday Brooklyn\nMy mother and sister is probably a lot to say you have a family of ... to ... birthday and mark when there's birthday so October twenty Marcus down on your calendar is everybody that's a strong day for birthdays come out [noise] um but other than the birthdays we have some other exciting news going on in the country right\nOh we have a lot of exciting news but why don't we start off talking with Danny about us little all practice or doing immigration law and we can kinda tied into all the many things that are happening in this world\nSo today's guest we have attorney Danny when Danny welcome to the show Oh thank you for having us um this is David went by the way oh sorry David when it's not a pound [laughter] okay so I had to read the first time when I said David yes he said it earlier this morning so yeah it's just maybe it's too early for\n... I was thinking of of there's a there's a\nCity council member Missouri city that's\nRight and he went sorry David so you have a immigration practice um you've been practicing law about ten years right\nThat's right practicing ten years we have an office in South west Houston and one in northwest Houston swell\nExcellent and uh so there's been some changes lately and could you tell me about the changes in immigration law it's you know some listeners might want to know about\nAnd socialize changes across immigration across the board so whether it's legal immigration are illegal immigration is changes across the board um some of the major changes um instant denial starting last month September if you send in a petition or application and there's anything wrong with that\nUsed to immigration used to send your request for more evidence or they send you a notice have tend to deny and give you an opportunity to fix the problem\nAnd so now no more they can instantly deny your application and again this is not like a rejection this is a denial so looks really really bad if you're trying to re apply later on\nSo what you're telling me is uh if someone is you know wants to work on their status or um you know wants to bring someone over marries someone or what have you they probably should not do it by themselves they're probably ... to go actually get a lawyer to help them with their immigration status is that what you're telling me David\nExactly you used to I used to tell people you know if if you read the law very carefully you could probably do this by yourself but now so much things have changed like I'll just give you an example so the basic forms that you need to sponsor a spouse a used to be last year before Sept twenty Seventeen\nOr the island thirty form it used to be five pages now he's Eighteen pages and then there's another form that supplements that used to be four or five pages now as an additional Eighteen pages and those just two formed out of the many forms that you have to file in order to bring someone to the U.S\nNow and this is things that are probably an attorney as best it encrypted ... which is that for assessment\nKnow this song even I'm like man\nWas\n\nTo\nJail you know the white man I could but none of the risk to do is ... and learn and I don't know but ah it used to the fact that you can do that\nI Believe I could show a day to your thing or two oh I'm sure you could show him sitting there to show him cut all the wrinkles in the ...\nHow bad it with Elizabeth Warren went out and first of all it's not really a bit less the other side agrees on the bed and maybe offer something in return if they lose the ... by the way you\nKnow this was just more of a a you know a promise I guess she did not acknowledge here's what he said though he specifically said that if she won the Democratic nomination\nAnd they rented a debate but then he would generally toss the ancestry tests to her\nIt wouldn't just be one that she went out and had done on her own right he would throw out the DNA test in a box she knows that came back that she was Native American he would give a million dollars to her favorite charity\nShe knows that she just playing the fact that most people sort of clause I hear things and then he goes back she goes back and plays on that said he said he pay a million dollars here I Am a big oh Indian and where's my million dollars like your one thousand sixty fourth\nIn India that is even true at all and it's quite questionable but it's still funny to use the term but as Susan road and we did here they did not come here her DNA to actual Native American\nDNA because they didn't have any fear they use the DNA from a Peruvian and Honduran otherwise natives you wouldn't have been hard to get Cherokee DNA they didn't bother getting any it could have been real easy in other words they didn't get it 'cause I knew it wouldn't matter no reason they didn't\nGet it it's just a you know there is not a lie too big for a Democrat to just stop and does it no I Can't say that in public for example\nThis a fat guy that cut up in\nSaudi Arabia and everybody's all up in arms that could be one of the\nBiggest ... and actually can be one of the ... it could start a war it could be one of the biggest crisis in the world is going up the journalist coast as journalists to already he kinda got all the upside of the the prince he didn't like him already CNN MSNBC ABC all the powers that be and the fake news media\nHave all got Trump being the reason this guy was cut up now listen to some of the reasoning\nWe've got a president that has already named journalists as being the enemy of the people said don't be surprised some other countries take on a journalist murderer chopping made the pieces and dispose Donald Trump\nIt was always been critical of the Washington Post always been critical of his ownership did anybody in the administration in Jared Kushner didn't they have a sort of a nod in the wings you say it's okay for the\nPresident like I said I'm Sorry that Jamal to show a is a um is a reporter he's a columnist really are at a at a critical of uh the Saudi Government that stands in contrast with a message that the president has frequently sent to the American people and to his supporters that the media are the enemy of the people how do you square those two I Wonder\nIf you look at what's happened in the last hundred days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric not just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with them anything at all\nI Can't compare that to you say because this is the president's attacks on journalists because of an accurate and fake news report and that's kind of the same excuse the Iranians use the turkey the Turks use the Chinese used and the Saudi she's right there issue is that these people who we think of the journalists reporting inaccurate and fake news about the government so you can see the connection I make\nIt right or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because the United states has retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nI remember vividly at train trip up I mean I saw when I talked to a group for international and international group to protect our allies have told me it was with a lot of Tom ... office they thought well why threat journalist [noise]\nShowing up and the kind of ... ... what is happening now in terms of human right not only to try and several hot spots around the world\nAnd let's face it we have a presence there also the values like freedom of speech and the satin\nSuddenly are very endangered around the world\nYeah these are the people that don't allow any just set [laughter] well uh\nYou'd you'd be shocked at how little the people with those opinions you want to know what your opinion\nIs oh we found that out during the day or two a fresh and their opinion you do not get that same right now you know put their roasted\nPaying again and the luggage whole boy another roasted

I mean Mexican guitar to a guy had gone under\nThat somebody I don't know who does that gets a thrill out of starting these death hoaxes on the Internet I don't get if somebody does and then it spreads and they go oh I'm so proud of myself look how far the fake news spread\nOn this day in history two hundred and twenty five years ago today let me guess nothing of no happened queen Marie Antoinette was beheaded guilty you know the French Revolution guess I was wrong most famous for saying let me ... was a big day for her to\nWell in Florida\nWas all hurricanes\nThe whole section as they get a hurricane zone and man\nIs an acting up I'm mad as hell Reverend Al ... at all no wins in jail for the ranks and why was one of the euro the\nFunny oh boy\nYeah he's accused of battering his forty one year old mother after asking her to make him some food\nAbout eight pm Monday what kind of who he won't probably something nice ... nice whip up a little some maybe some soup that'd be good\nShe said yeah no problem but you got to have to give me a few minutes 'cause I'm real busy\nUnderstandable she's not there to just you know drop everything I Want a bowl of soup well golly off Gasper in ... by the way is unemployed became very angry he'd been asked to wait\nAccording to probable cause statement ... Gaspar instead I flew sausages that my mother\nOne sausage struck her in the rye or boy\nAlso repeatedly push Tara backwards and place just hand around her neck a figure not restructure breathing why but he had choking motion around the neck you did that a plant down\nJust saying what I could do mhm they're saying they also are their chests bumped tour around the kitchen while he was eating that's not funny she's a little old lady did defend it stated that he got so bad that he hurled sausages at me\n... Gaspar in with a name like that it might have been ... hurled I don't know a contended that he had done nothing wrong and it said he would not have tossed the sausages if his mother had just said I'm Sorry\nThat she didn't\nKill you off Gasper in was looked for domestic battery and looked into the county jail where he remains locked up to this moment well there's good and leave and they know sausages in there to throw at any one is anybody bringing him flu\nYou know you've got to go down and get a job ... somebody might make a little put in ... and later [laughter]\nOh he just been born in this day at least five hundred feet away from his mother at all time I'd like him to stay five hundred feet away from me to place and I don't think ah you he can throw a sausage that far awfully awfully she's going to be safer now\nAll right I'm all have to see your Florida Man and raise you a Florida Man while we're in Florida\nYou don't have to play the whole music and all that kind of you know they're all just as wacky as can\nOnly mop Florida Man is a woman named Rachel, Rachel is\nThirty eight and Rachel has been arrested for murder and taken to the jailhouse according to her statement\nShe stabbed her husband to death by accident\n'cause she slipped on some dog who while just randomly holding a kitchen knife\n... that's\nHow she says it happened ah the old ... slipped in dolls Lucy or a dog who while holding a knife standing by my husband who ended up getting stabbed in the chest until dead now how many times you slip on that food sadly\nShe gave multiple\nExplanations for how this happened a\nOne time she 'cause they've had or a question for a while she said she was doing the dishes and holding the dog\nAnd it happened to be ... you know picked up the knife when she slipped and then she uh you know stabbed him a kids dragging the dog into this situation yep I'm\nNow when emergency services arrived Rachel's house she was standing there naked with the knife and her feet now you know if she was doing the dishes naked I'm One of the explanations you gave 'em that she\nHad a force of ... ... sounds really bad for her doing the dishes holding the dog oh here's the other one she said she had been slicing pizza or when she went outside after hearing the dog whimpering she found the dog covered in feces a ... year at night and all over the floor\nAnd her husband walked over to help and that's when she slipped\nRight after cutting the pizza and she still had the knife in our hand and she stabbed him\nUm what does he say he's dead\nSo nothing no and he said a word ... can be well it's pretty much her word against nobody right\nGiven three or four different versions of the story but basically Rachel just said it was an accident and I didn't I don't want to go to jail\nSo once it or\nWas it last week we told you about the waffle house index\nWell there's the waffle house index and the Wal Mart in ... waffle house yet was last week\nFEMA uses a color coded indicator it keeps\nTrack of whether waffle houses are open closer operating with unlimited menu to inform you about how bad weather hazard has got\nA couple of days ago they use the Walmart index they said something about the size of the storm hurricane Michael had closer to forty Wal Mart\nThat's pretty scary\nBut an waffle house indicator is is we're already waffle houses wow USA Today reports twenty two waffle houses close to Florida\nEight waffle houses closed in Georgia\nAt least one of those was actually damage on a giant billboard fell because of the when a ... a lot of times they'll put a lawful house under giant billboards and I'm sure that makes them very nervous in the case of storms\nMostly that is you're taking shelter what's being called the third most powerful hurricane Bob ... hit the uh blah blah blah yeah yeah you know the rest of the story but the waffle house indicator a micro closed down thirty waffle houses and how many I was at forty Walmart Walmart that's that's a big storm [noise] huge\nNow you you'd probably be ... probably especially interested to know that not all of the money that the uh the city and the state gathers when they get hurricane relief yeah uh funds that come and go towards the relief that it wasn't tend to kind of like what the Clintons\nWe got a mayor and Houston name of a Turner I don't know if you've uh you'd be familiar with mayor\nTurn I Am he's the guy that won the world series I saw him on a ... way that it everybody like he won the world series\nYou would think mayor Turner and his city hall\nHas a dedicated about fifty percent of the Harvey flood control relief fund to mayor Turner's special projects that have nothing to do with blood relief flood control or anything else he is directing that money and those projects specifically to voting communities and segments of the city\nThat manage to push the mayor ... and the\nWinning the ... you know he did not win that election by much out and vote dissolved and he knows exactly what areas are tend to vote more for him than than somebody else that almost\nAnd so I may have never heard it about three hundred million dollars for his special projects from taxes to pay them bombs to all kinds of other little things that are maybe you did not intend for it to go\nTo I'm just kind of old school but I see that it's kind of like corruption\nI mean that's almost like a criminal kind of thing isn't it now he openly brags that he intends to keep the heat on heightened it intends to keep diverting fifty percent of Harvey relief funds do special projects and has no intention of spending\nThe money on flood control or anything at all to do with flood damage repaired or any of the stuff people gave it for eight\nVoting base pet projects so if you get a chance to vote come November no\nOn the rain tax it's being cold which allows the mayor to keep using the money on whatever\nHe thinks it should go to\nSome of the mayor I Am [laughter]\nWould you go to bed at yeah they should have voted for Bill gang he don't like it be the mayor of you\nKnow I may think about it\nIt's not the first time a radio personality became the mayor of a there's a lot of these things going on like that and if you'd like to know more you can just Google rebuild Houston and take a look at it in depth for yourself when I

growing call eight six\nSix three four six seven to three three\nWe have talked before about how the real risk of exposure to the markets is not disgusted in the media or by brokerage houses we use safe money programs based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to Thirteen percent\nWhile locking in your yearly gains and also know fees are loads taken from your deposit\nThis message is different from what you normally hear on financial planning shows largely because our concepts are different most brokers base their financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divides up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops one thing that is rarely talked about is that it also limits your again when the market goes up\nWe have a better idea what if you could participate in some of the market gains without participating in any market losses our emphasis is on preservation of your principal participation in some of the market gains and lifetime income that you cannot outlive\nWe help set you up in a retirement that you can be sure of\nMarkets always retests new lows but when the market's going to the next dive it won't matter to you once you've escape

lost value is just the first problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss but\nThe third problem is is it is almost impossible for you to regain your losses let me explain\nIf you have a market exposed account of one hundred thousand dollars in the markets dropped by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful right but that's just the beginning imagined the markets go back up the next year by the same thirty percent\nAre you back to your original hundred thousand dollars no you're not\nWhy is that after dropping thirty percent the account is that Seventy thousand so the next thirty percent gain is on Seventy thousand not a hundred thousand thirty percent of Seventy thousand is Twenty one thousand and Twenty one thousand edited the Seventy thousand is Ninety One thousand\nIt would take a forty three percent gain after the thirty percent loss just to get back to where you were starting\nWhich was a hundred thousand\nThat is why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my listeners is windows negative thirty plus forty three equals zero the answer is when you lose thirty percent of the market it takes forty three percent gain just to get back to zero\nHere's another question when does negative thirty equals zero the answer to that is when you were a client of mine in a safe money account\nThat's because my clients have no possibility of market losses ever so you never have to worry about trying to regain losses also upfront bonuses and a guaranteed lifetime income account that his contractually guaranteed to grow up to eight percent compounded per year for income purposes\nIf any of this is confusing I'll be happy to explain it to you when you call eight six
