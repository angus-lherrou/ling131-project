Supreme Court\nMillion with the am bitter question\nIs can we get some of these uh state for pets to donate to some of our jazz is just getting just donated enough [laughter] that\nThat make it okay so let's kinda plus break this down and all that 'cause it's go a lot of on a different way so you've got an insurance company the biggest the biggest one and the nation\nPeople wonder why jump up and down and say don't get said form it's the worst one all my newsletters number one say\nState Farm there vindictive they're going to find any way to take advantage of\nYou love their commercials though man some in only I've even in their commercials is good stuff\nIt is good stuff you clip a few uh you know put your heels together and then ... then they aren't there\nWere there when they need the money for whenever he found to pay the claim apparently they are they they say too bad so sad call your dad go sue us but if you get a good job it's not going to pay five million dollars to kick out that charge to get someone else\nSo seems like it looks like there was an original case that um I guess the plane is one about a billion dollars or so of the case was already one and it looks like the wind bet gap this judge on the bit\nAnd allow there's just so they go back and undo the case well of course that's what a judge to even for Chicago even for Illinois that was pretty dangerous stuff cheaper than paying ... billion is a little early what is\nWhat do you think about that Russia so what do you think about State Farm trying to fix the judge we see that going on in Harris County in the criminal court [laughter]\nWell ah I think people think that can happen but I don't actually see it happening but you know one of the questions I have about that is just stayed far as being called out on this one how many times as it happened in the past that's a great question that I Would have about this a problem that's presented in Chicago\nI see it every day folks I see it all the time every day for State Farm so I'm just going to just tell you about it um estate foreign does you're wrong you hire an attorney you sue I'm your ... your choices are taken to the box\nOr walk away and that's kind of they don't they don't they don't care they make you try cases they they'll spend the last\nOne I tried they spent maybe four or five hundred thousand dollars it was just over like a ten thousand dollar dispute folks it's not over much money as over ten thousand dollars they didn't pay\nThe guy to replaces Ruth after the storm damage that happened up in the Dallas area he was upset he's like I've been paying into safe for for all this time\nAnd you know a bigger the least they do you know I've been paying them you know three thousand four thousand five thousand dollars here at least they do is you don't pay to fix my ... but no no\nThey made them have taken to the box\nOr three years later we had a trial so you know\nIt happens all the time what what their strategy is to just blow you out of the water is built oppose every single person if you have an attorney or proving up attorney fees build oppose you interesting so you know you ought to a city you do family law right\nDoing family law I I just have ... you prove up attorney fees all the time I Know you either the husband will say you know you made me do this stuff is a portion of equities since we're married\nYou know pay for my attorney fees or the why for the there'll be a child support little fight and it's like you're making me have to do this pay up my attorney fees that is correct happens all the time every day\nEvery day somebody wants to find out and make sure that it's an equitable ... that are being paid on both sides and there are some situations where you're entitled to the attorney fees so if you foundation for enforcement and you're successful\nAnd when I ... that means let's say your baby mama to use the phrase to save him in not allowing you to be here can't according to an order will just don't like that especially here in Harris County we've got some really great family law attorney that judges on the bench right now\nAnd you're entitled to your attorney's fees if that judge bills that there was a violation of that order\nSo in those cases how how many of those cases have you seen have just a guess how many have you done in your life or those type of cases\nI I Can't even count like thousands tens of thousands I'm not that old [laughter] say hundreds like I Would say probably about a hundred at this point\nRight and then uh the each week you've seen it two three four times right\nYes at least each week to three just depending on our sketch of\nHow many times has opposing counsel thought it'd be a good idea to depose or someone over the attorney fees\nAbsolutely nine in fact we barely question each other miss the time if they're fairly reasonable under our lives at this point isn't it that's correct except they pack up on this point especially on those types of cases\nNow which shocks me get this every time every single time I take a State Farm tasted the box they spend three four and this is\nNice three for eight hours eight hours opposing me over attorney fees eight hours\nWe call that being a bully they're trying to intimidate and they're trying to make a point\nAnd they're using you as part of it obviously because if one attorney said it's not worth it then maybe the next person will take a State Farm case it's a deterrent on their part correct\nThey know that if they start doing it across the way because obviously you have friends that are playing U.S attorneys just like we have friends that are family law attorney in criminal law attorneys and so we talk\nAnd there are certain cases in certain court which I Will say that I may try a little bit more because I Know it may be a little more difficult to deal with and I'm sure you and your friends discuss State Farm and none of the\nGood news is just not many people that take a first party insurance claims especially with the current laws in place that are exceptionally favorable to insurance companies you had a five forty two way that happened\nUm you know over the last legislative session where you had Texans for Wall Street reform basically bribing people to push that law and place\nI'm just saying this is always there excuse or evil plaintiff lawyers greedy plaintiff lawyers that they just they're taking advantage of every\nBody and I just don't spare enough that's just their propaganda and usually when there's propaganda it's there's a reason for the propaganda and I'm going to kind of off or not just just a tangent but since we're going off in this tangent let's run with a little bit um another thing I Want to talk about what\nMakes me upset about this they flew in the case is my main millionaire did wasn't the attorney\n[laughter]\nHow how\nMuch um was um it was for any reason that most of them is in a restaurant we go to oh ... how many times we just went down to a ... view\nLifetime supply [laughter]\nHe could have gone in a\nTime [laughter]\nHe doesn't margaritas for everyone\nNo way we and we just we we we just get the ... we're going to be getting a little little meals\nWere ordering launched middle and an hour we aren't buying a restaurant [laughter]\nExcuse me [laughter]\nYou especially as the kids to renew with three kids so [laughter] yeah you can run of the girls only eat one of them [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay so we're going to take a quick break we're going to be back a rich talk about twenty yeah Texas when storm we're talking about the court house seat of affairs with a family and criminal court houses in of course we're talking about the debate last night with\nA Beto and Ted Cruz they stay with us next folks [laughter]\n[noise] oh\nAll right we're back\nI've got a bunch of great people here for a bill called Bryant here Russell and a Cynthia Newman yellow grade a family in criminal law here in Houston\nAnd uh let's talk about Texas when storm whether it's worth it whether we should get rid of it\nUm that's kind of go a little background\nA Texas when storm is insurance company of last resort along the coast um laws changed maybe in two thousand and let's say five\nMaking it pretty difficult to get a Texas when storm to actually pay Klein you have a lot of articles happening a lot of um people suing saying that um\nTexas when storm they sent out an initial just are saying that the damage was like eighty thousand then that was too much and they had to spin send out like a new adjuster to come out come back and just knock the number down to like ten Fifteen thousand my question is is\nShould we even half Texas when store while we pay the money on this and they're ripping people off why do we even have it why why why are we even deal\nWanted the issue or a last resort from what I was just whatever it\nWell I don't okay so I hear you saying that students are of last resort but you've got to keep in mind here's kind of the beauty of it uh there's also the lender place policy\nI just I just can't believe it was made a a let me have this show I think they're just gotten like they'd just gotten desperate in a cave and find some poor\nLawyer on the side of the street and then just give 'em a show as well as for food\n[laughter] yeah that's right and that's the sign I had\nA ... thanks guys I'm back Eric day were let's just kind of jump into it a better versus cruise what do you think a Russell what do you think of the debate that happened last night\nUm I think Beto\nReally has a good campaign on his hands I think there are many people\nThat are coming to my house big after day asked me to sign forum and there's more signs on every lawn I keep getting test message yeah Texas is to you know he's really trying and he has this grassroots campaign but I don't think he's going to be cruise I don't think he has\nWhat it takes I don't think he has I think he's likeable but I don't think he's the experience he doesn't have the experience he doesn't have\nThe the aura about him to be our next senator says when ... spears um become a requirement to win the\nLess I guess about a man in comparing\nThe two ... two of them when you're trying to determine which do you feel will win in the long run it just seems like really seems more together I mean I'm not saying we're we're supporting either we're not getting into that drama here\nAm I ... I was just talking about as far as the ability to get out the vote a mixture\nOf your voters make sure you're based shows up for the election then that's that's that's what determines I mean 'cause there's a lot of gray judicial candidates on the ballot a nominal Sherry dean yeah I'm John shooting the leash\nA little or New York yeah\nLard hum yea run\nIt's kind of catch ... on their right but is there a line [laughter] probably watch it I guess probably [laughter] Oh yes there are a lot but it's not based\nOn that it's based on who gets there who gets who just the people out to vote I mean right all those guys are in jeopardy of of losing their jobs um the leader of the Republican base that get out there in in king but all the Democrats or some way super motivated to come out the vote\nI see some of that the judges that are really trying they're going a little bit further than normal because I think they really do feel that they need to just advocate for themselves\nAnd I think the ride I my just me sitting on the sidelines here I see that ah I've never seen so many signs I'd never seen so much support\nFor a Democrat running for a U.S Senate I'm not saying he's gonna win 'cause he's not\nUm he doesn't have the uh the ability to get Republicans to support him and unfortunately a Texas is at least two thirds I ought to be generous and say sixty percent Republican and I'm not saying the Republicans like Ted Cruz 'cause a lot of 'em don't\nShockingly a very large amount of um you know I'm I'm Sorry folks they don't I have county commissioners in Harris County telling me what an SOB is and these are people in his\nHand names or I'm not going to now you're not from this show [laughter]\nI'm not going to name\nNames but if you know me can you can deduct it pretty quick [laughter]\nBut I have four of them I Know there's only four at but anyway my point is is is that um for better to wait and I think he had he had more of a shot prior to uh the debate but for him to when he has\nTo have crossover appeal when all he did is he showed he was a liberal Democrat\nCorrect moderates wanted to vote for him they still don't like Ted Cruz I don't know whether they're going to vote or not independence\nThey don't particularly like Ted Cruz but they're afraid of better because he's a socialist that maybe not per se a socialist but he's very very liberal and that can't be denied\nSo that's it I think the race truly is better ways to lose and he's losing it\nAnd you'd think if he was in the middle he'd have a greater shot at that point\nI absolutely think yeah I like when I when I I think if he just told Republicans hey guys look I'm Christian\nAnd I know I I don't like abortion\nI don't really support abortion but I think you should have you know something they should work there or at least say look I'm just a senator I'm not going to touch those rights when I'm versus a Texan I care about helping people\nI care about keeping us secure if he just he didn't have to say I support building a wall he just had to say I understand that something needs to be out there to secure our borders to take care of that\nAnd he was right about the about not having a wall you know a dividing your property that happens on the border you have the government actually build a wall and separate your property where it's just that kind of it is right on that\nHe is he shouldn't have government go in there during ... and just putting a big wall and the middle of your property correct or taking away you're listening to realize that you're probably pay your rent\n[laughter] I wouldn't mind wandering shipping chip and\nSo he's not he's not often that I actually I and I do support all being built I just don't think you should destroy people's property building the wall um well\nI thought you did a really good job of comparing him to Hillary he kept a lady why should it be a Ted Cruz he kept saying you and Hillary un Hillary which is a really good a strategy in my opinion\nAlso I'm sort of talking about him not being lockstep protests and that's not what to try to uh almost\nMaking the outsider which I thought he did a really good job but when I and also did a good job is acting like a jerk\nAnd that's what he's really good at it I don't mean to be anything but whenever you had better at the very end try to be nice and then had kind of being sarcastic it didn't help him\nThere was a reason why this race is as close as it is ... there has to be a reason why am I don't buy into a bunch of liberal liberals pouring money into it because if that's not that happens all the time the reason it's so close is because Ted Cruz is not likeable\nAnd the reason he's not likeable is how we treat people and this is what I tell all the all the politicians I mean all the great judges that we named before\nHow you treat people how you treat the people in your court how you treat people that you don't even expect that plays a giant role in politics and life\nIn life in a business and everything yeah it does resonate for almost four\nMillion people did vote for Hillary Clinton by the way it was what a forty three to fifty three percent a Hillary versus\nA a Trump or was it two years ago\nOh there's a lot of Democrats are in ... says\nUh who has the ability to vote for veto oh what was what was the what was the end in numbers with a Trump and Hillary I think a Trump got about fifty three percent a to Hillary's forty three percent well there you go so you have a point eight million to three pointed\nMarket but I'm going to get back into the benefit of the doubt and say he gets the forty eight percent\nAnd that's the thing that I think that the ants making is that even the he needs to do something to make himself more likeable ... some of the Republicans that are on the fence at the independent because even if he gets wet Hillary guy he's not\nGoing to but but you but that line was we used to talking about half of the state so in my opinion a large portion of a large portion of wars Hillary votes came from was the same area that cruises or well what\nI think Eric is saying is that Cruz is a phone although right now and better could do a better job of grabbing the people that are on the fence by being more moderate but he's not doing that he has a shot and he's not taking it that's right\nThat's exactly what I'm saying but I don't think I don't think a Beto is a I think he's a very he comes off as a nice guy as a passionate guy like I I disagree with him strongly on a number of issues but I think um I think personality only goes so far\nThough he has a good personality he'd have to at least not scare Republicans even just people at disliked Ted Cruz to think that even though we disliked it grew strongly you know worst we might dislike you more that's\n[laughter] that's that's that's it well you can't underestimate speeches and likeability a there was a young black for a couple years back who won the presidency a couple of times but he didn't win Texas town and I will not I'm not I'm not saying I don't want\nOne Harris County and this is what I what what kind of kind of maybe end on this is that we have some really really great people and the Republican side running for office and there's been what I've heard of sort of been internal polling with the Republican Party there's been I've even heard that a damn Patrick\nHas some serious apprehension that the Republicans lose Harris County right and if that happens it's going to be very sad because people like Sherry dean and I I've known her a long time she is a very very sweet\nWoman Roy Moore to almost forgot about Mel Gibson farm or catch bar is probably one of the most qualified family law\nJudges on the bench he's amazing and he\nDoor probably that one with that little circle where they were in Ghana plane was a ... coffee pot a junior fend off the people they are trying to fight that he began to pull the door or liver\nOr lever lover the lever lever\nGive me a lever a anyway he was trying to open the back door all set and you can't do that not in progress that has barely a it's it's pretty tough to do at a
