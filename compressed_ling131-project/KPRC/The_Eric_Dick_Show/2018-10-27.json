gee service but day in ... from the political aspect or Trump himself he he apparently laid out national five gee strategy and is non political as I get so but I Will tell you about from a from the federal standpoint\nAh he did sign a presidential memorandum and it described as the administration's push for national spectrum strategy\nAnd one that says you should help promote spectrum accessing efficiency\nAnd I was going to come into the memo which I fell asleep during uh but uh he did note that the ever growing importance of adequate wireless communication technology\nAs well as his desire for the use the U.S to be the leader in five ... to ... to ... and you know this is not a knock on anything is not just him but does anybody who was elected official really know much about five gee I mean I I Know somewhat some limited because I Do covered this stuff but [noise]\nUh there's a lot of lobbyists probably out there or Washington DC who are saying and this and by the way to go when you

wants to get up on the speed of this but I'm Eighteen the rise in the mobile they've announced they're five ... plans\nAnd he did the White House did say this quote we we will prior to prioritize efforts to accelerate the private sector's development of five jeez at the American people can read the words of this incredible technology to the way I'm reading is is the White House now going to take credit for five gee I I'm not sure if there's one person\nWho actually knows anything about cell phone use of it is our president\nThe dude has gotten from what I read I read I think it was at USA Today a few days ago he's got not one not two but three iPhones number one he needs to get on the Android platform sir but he's got in the interesting thing is these things aren't secure he's the president of our wonderful United States and these things are not secured\nI remember when uh when Obama was elected Obama was the first president who really used phone was a member hit a blackberry and they had to come up with is with a special super secret decoder nobody could break it and I don't think now at a minister ration is is that secure I don't need anybody hacking these towns\nWere

tree of life synagogue\nHussein is very bad inside throw a ... there are multiple fatalities there at least six centuries to include for police officers the police officers injuries but just harm or non life threatening the other individuals are critical and serious in nature\nSure so I'm just kind of a way of background you know I'm I'm not I'm not against a per se the idea of a drag queen our I think it's kind of funny um like my thought is I Am [noise]\nWhy are we doing it necessarily where we used a public money for this and they're saying no there's no real public money with it but the kind of is they're kind of had the libraries kind of advertising it they're kind of promoting it they're spending the resources pushing this\nAnd then it kinda gets interesting because you have a secular humanism versus non secular humanism and they sort of complicated mumbo jumbo words\nUm they sound like it they are um basically it's the idea that it's like Christian the viewpoints of um you know believing marriage is a man and woman\nThat been the idea of a liberal religion and the non Christian viewpoints and that's the point that um that you know you could have these non Christian viewpoints there\nI'm pushing this agenda at the library and not be able to have the counterpart there that's where it's not fair and that's where I kind of have a problem with it um I think that if if you know people could go there and say look marriages between a man and woman this is what we believe\nThen you know it's kind of it kind of even the playing field but there's another thing that that really kind of makes me cringe is I have two small kids does and I it's kind of that's not really something I Want to introduce them to if we're going to the library\nTo you know get books and stuff like that I mean we've kind of want to avoid it at that point I don't really want to start having to explain to my daughter is why this guy's dress up like a girl\nNow what do you say to the to the proponents of this hour they say you know you choose to go to the public library and you can always say you know for this hour I'm not going to go there should you have to rearrange your schedule to fit in for fit into the city of Houston's agenda as it relates to the drag queens three hour\nI just don't think it's I mean I don't think it's it's really fair and I don't think you should have to look at you know the schedule whenever you just want to go to a public place and uh you know learn teacher you know bring your kids to you know the library um I'm fine with it being in a private place in fact I'd probably go I think it's\nA minimum entertaining I think it's it really is entertaining and I think\nYou know that they're brings a I I can see the diversity argument you\nKnow the mayor has made a diversity arguments and we have a very diverse city uh this is just reflective of our culture does reflect diversity and he sees no problem with that thinks that that's a frivolous lawsuit is going to get thrown out\n... suit a lot of times for what they would consider frivolous stuff like the fertilized egg feeding the home that was all sorts of stuff but what do you think what do you think\nAbout the way you put it today Dick ... you're right I didn't think about my kids being there when I first heard of it I was like yes it's kind of humorous approach I don't really understand why there's also even started in my humble opinion as I understand that they weren't letting someone else go and that's what the arguments about or is it simply because of the fact that they have the ... was\nThe title use ... a secular humanism secular humanism like yeah yeah so apparently the the the impetus of this was that the same type of requests for traditional marriage couple to go in there and have a story time was denied when the drag queen our was actually given a clearance to go ahead and so\nAnd this is some really juicy so we're going to get brought back in it where there are some alternatives to a public library when talking about when we come back from Britain's well\nThanks folks [noise]\nAll real estate agent a mortgage broker [noise]\nCome listen to my show the

at the brewers games I like to watch her [noise] keep score\nOn fat on\nAlways on watching the Astros game see who was sitting right up there and him good seat behind home plate goal or not just the play offs but especially the playoffs you solve bag well and his wife oh\nYeah that was just he might just kick your ass he'd probably come up and give me a good ... I Believe they can handle yeah I've heard good just for looking at is a lady I Know is retired and everything but he still probably got enough to take you down back well Meteo and no one ...\n... the three that you'd spot there it every game during the play offs and uh I'll tell you that and George Bush I'm assuming Nolan is aware and some of them adult diapers\nHe never got a [noise] now how does\nThat mean games go three and a half hour and all around which just sit there with that same ... look on his face you know I feel there's a long walk to the bathroom there and he was a net\nIn the TV cameras that he probably didn't even think about being on him didn't care uh but yeah it got hurt to get up and down and walk them steps and go back there just to and you know an old man like gas to go ...\nGo out no one could have been in a suite with a private bathroom would have been ... a guy like no one wants to be buying that play where you can see the pitch you didn't nobody talked too much either he wants to see those pictures see women and young if he's got this stuff today\nAre thinking about disasters games reminds me of when Barbara Bush was alive and you'd see that big massive shining glowing gray hairs sitting back there like I Am the getting higher giant thing of cotton candy not miss mar\nWhen a when her and George would go to those games\nAnd that reminds me of a like you were talking about they're gone on to the reward old men\nAnd dads and my old man had season tickets the Astros for years decades and he never\nGot to see a World Series polio no even a World Series appearance but I think the percentage are of people that had season tickets versus the oh my gosh the the big win last year the first game I went to were dead in his season tickets now he was in the insurance game so a lot of time to other seat\nOr have to go I learned later\nProbably chose girlfriend in customer customer rage that I'm taking a much dimmer to the game legitimately clients didn't go to the game I think the girlfriend went to a few too but I never had to go sit on her lap or anything that would have been an\nUncle aunt Suzy [laughter] I did have\nThere was this one time I had to wait in the car where we had to swing by an Suzy ... not alone is you have to weigh one law guy but he didn't want to know it wasn't an abusive thing I can you went in there and had some fun or whatever he just forgot something there and they had to go pick it up and\nHe was out like in five minutes I forgot I left my job over there I'm going to go get it why would you leave something apartment complex there was this is all about [laughter] but anyway\nUm the very first game I saw was a a cult forty\nFives game season tickets even when they were the ... forty five just aren't enough\nAnd that became an astro thing and then later and asked her thing and they always had the good seats sort out behind home plate back there where you can see the pictures and the\nIdea of what you're safe back there I see those your very safe so so foul balls go rocketing right over the ... de dum de ... the high you'd never going to get a foul ball I Know you need to take your glove and this man up and say hit me with a book and pepper on it they're never\nGoing to score a ball because they've got that net up there on tap the only time I ever got a ball\nWas because when I work with eats where are you in the conference well when I was a dead ... they didn't have Crawford seat back in those days was we're talking Astrodome days at this point astronaut even pre Astrodome when they put up a temporary stadium out there on the planes are the Astrodome\nWhere the Astrodome was being built build it and they will come they put up a temporary little stadium was kind of rickety\nCycling this crowd was start stopping their feet oh God I Wish they stop your vote both everybody's still may still this is going to come down to stop this\nBut uh I Do catch a ball one time because I went with my little league team and we weren't behind the plate we're in the outfield that's where the kids are supposed to be and ... of playing the Chicago Cubs and Ernie Banks at a home run and I got the\nBall now you're not supposed to keep the other team ball when they hit a home run less famous\nWhich he was famous you know it's kind of thing so I went down and to the dugout and got the Ernie Banks to sign it and I don't know\nWhere the hell that ball is probably worth something I\nKnow back in the day I went down and got him so I think\nWe may end up playing pitch with it at some time it'll probably take it out in the yard are so stupid we do things like that it's like I had a football signed by Earl Campbell\nAfter an oil or game and we played football in the front yard with that thing it was so stupid to do is put that away somewhere got Earl Campbell signed it after a big game right there the front yard skin it up on the sidewalk and whatnot 'cause we're corn on the freeway mad or kids who didn't have a budget do to throw around\nI got me one em Oilers helmets that Earl Campbell autographed yeah no for many helmet none of us read like ads in a solid heavy helmet face masks yeah I Know for a fact\nThat are all never ward and again you just autographed it it was all the equipment ... I've tried to put my head and saying\nI'm going to put my head and there were Earl Campbell head was I couldn't get that thing to my ear is probably the reason he was able to get it for nothing it was like I didn't see anybody had it was the small nobody nobody wants to the small man the small beautiful anyway it's still there\nYou know that's our history has always felt bad 'cause you'll never saw
