I'm hoping I don't stroke out don't want to stroke out hope that I don't stroke and I pray for ... you know but if I Do\nI Hope the firefighters you know they aren't too busy working their spare jobs falling asleep for marketers spare jobs so they can actually you know I Want them to be able to be you know have make an honest living\nAnd being able to take care of people so whenever the stroke it out they could actually go help them I mean what is it an adult novel idea\nIt is I mean I think oh Houston hero should be adequately compensated oh Mr back what do you think\nWell unfortunately what I've seen and just going out and about campaigning is is this issue is pitted the police officers against the firefighters which is unfortunate because they both serve our public at large and uh we need both\nUm adequately equipped and are adequately compensated\nAnd so it's it's unfortunate that you've got this issue or and I and I've seen a statistics like you mentioned Chris where are our firefighters or don't compare well with other metropolitan areas and and I don't know what the answer is but it's unfortunate that it's turned out the way it is where\nThe two groups are at each other and are on an issue that you would think would be something everybody could come together on\nThey should whenever I ran for mayor in most you know what I took the playbook for ... back or you know public safety your infrastructure your basic city services UNICEF cities you pick a few things do a good job at it\nBut I don't see how we're doing a good job of public safety whenever our poor firefighters they're making twenty seven thousand dollars a year\nAnd we can all agree in this room I think that there's plenty of money in the budget being wasted in other areas of city government that aren't really necessary services that can be used for the firefighters stay\nFor what are you talking about all that great art and the bike trail so I think there are I I Love the Biafra have a great city I have to have a great city you know I Know but it might be on fire but it'll be a green city\nYeah that's a good point I mean I I've been interesting to see how this unfolds on on the ballot box November but something tells me that this fight won't be over in November that's got to be something that's going to be thrown to the courts kind of like a half before [noise] so\nThere's no telling what's gonna happen but when I when I Am happy about is it the firefighters are pushing for what they believe is right and I just don't think they've been they've gotten a fair Robin is I'm kind of some background on this\nAccount with the firefighters they had a kind of a better pension and in return they were paid less or what slide did is he went to the legislature cut their pension\nSo now they're paid less and have kind of lousy pension the police or the other hand they were paid in advance they have like a social pigeon so you know\nReally what's happening is the cities it's over spending and it's trying to basically steel firefighters money out of it and I'm just kind of trying to have their cake and eat it too and it's just it's it's morally wrong I don't see where it doesn't it doesn't it's not right\nSo it's our family firefighters out there anybody who sports as ... as it gets his property initiative I give us a call and say what you think someone three two one two five nine five zero\nUm but that's the only thing is going on at home right now we reached some bomb show just released the me too movement is back and apparently Sylvia Garcia may be involved with that when we'll talk about that more\nO s that's usually don't go anywhere you get to hear about touchy Sylvia soon [noise]\nWe'll be right back on the show [noise]\nSee [noise] you\nGuys should pull over did you talk to your lawyer can you can you tune in now is it OK you guys clear it because I'm telling you it's it's about to get it's about to get really really juicy\nIf he ever got legal counsel before now's the time and a man\nI said before we left off ... Garcia bank it's fire so apparently you know I was up in arms about these allegations some years ago when the Supreme Court nomination process when Sylvia Garcia had the same allegations from Twenty years ago with a female staffer\nAlternately rash Korea rants on dry idea what you're talking about about touchy Sylvia I made ... ... there's\nSome allegations about you know the other Garcia running in increasing to count on them grabbing Garcia\nNow it's like everybody's last night Garcia Ron ... seems to have this problem are legit problem I mean what's going on over there and what's going on but with the Democrats on on the east end of of Harris County\nSo what what what happened there wasn't it just some some female staffer and uh let's\nSylvie it's like well I got a rash you want to see this rash fame will vote for pants runs around her panties rubber on her\nYeah from what I read in this affidavit or the portion I got I mean it's pretty pretty gruesome are pretty detailed in terms of ah Sylvia what an herb leave clerk to examine her as if she was a doctor and matter of felt very uncomfortable\nMr Black in this age of meat so does that bode well for voter confidence in the Senate district twenty nine going forward in November\nI think I Would have wrestler district two nights are I Would think not I mean it with this Cavanaugh a stuff are in such a recent times\nAnd the new standards that's apparently out there with how we uh a deal with accusations I Can't imagine this being a good thing or for Sylvia Garcia or anybody else it's facing such a interesting allegations\nSurfaced ... does she need to step down or resigned because that was the Democrats' main thing against you know break out and I can be a a public official can be anything on the Supreme Court because he has the allegations so do we now hold that standard for Sylvia Garcia\nI Wish but you know it's probably just like what she looks accidently her constituents just don't care if she wants to go round touching superheroes well that's just touchy Sylvia that's what she does and that's unfortunately you have a another person you know I'm One of\nNot be exceptionally placed pull which of easy all all the department has to not do is take a bunch of money and get some gas you're set on fire ... as long as they don't do that were good\nBecause because of the department of education actually runs that as a surplus they they they're never over budget they actually\nAre probably the most efficient countywide government organization is that correct to say\nThat actually is it's true we're thirty million dollars in the black\nUsually these ah government agencies involving education or in the red but worth thirty million in the black a hundred million dollar budget here we do a decent job I'm not going to give it in a I'd give it like a B minus the plus it it could it has room for improvement\nBut when it's not doing is taking money it just throwing it away like H ISD\nYeah and that's and that's the problem with ... and just watching that this weekend and seeing how again that racial divide these students are going to be the ones affected you know they're going to start having attention I don't want to see a black versus panic rivalry started in the city of Houston I don't want that doing you know started in in\nAn age I see a in the schools are on the board\nAre but I'm sure it's going to you know we say political affiliation doesn't matter but I mean they're all Democrats and they're going to start turned on each other um there was going to be a lot of people start saying don't vote for Democrats won't do rope here do vote there and so they're going to be a lot of parties which in our party lines are being drawn\nAnd talking about some other star studded county officials who are also going to say jump over party lines\n[laughter] don't go anywhere Eric Dick show we're just warming up folks better talk with your lawyer [noise]\n\nMan Chris I got this really bad rationed my leg and I don't I don't know you wanna you wanna see it you know who doesn't need as the major league clerk had won [laughter]\nOkay guys were back oh\nBoy I'm so what happened this week was just giant with them at all to hunker down\nHe said that won't want he got he got a you know he got the chronicles\nThe door you got the chronicles indoors I was shocked and he was excited draw I Wish I'd who would've thought that that the chronicles including doors old hunker down [laughter] I don't need live over at the Astrodome isn't that where he lives now I\nThink he has a personal sweet being built underneath so when we have the next hurricane he can hunkered down in his personal private ...\nAnd he loves he loves the Astrodome so anyway who doesn't he loves ... he doesn't love lieutenant damn doesn't love Dan Patrick apparently\nMan in a in a bombshell announcement this week at him at the Harris County judge has publicly stated he didn't just say he was not going to vote for the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor he went out and make sure he stated I Am going to vote for the Democrat my colleague here\nThat's huge how does that affect Republicans' down ballot as someone who was on the ballot in November re Jay Black junior how does that affect you and the rest of your brother in running for judge this November that the county judge has come out and said break up the ticket and cross party lines well\nSince this is the last ah year we're going to have strict party voting here in Harris County um it's a it's a board I think at least for Republican judges that we get as many stray party voters as we can uh I Know the judge him it\nDoes great work for the county always has and it's very popular but he's also a not one to uh to shy away from supporting\nUm Democrats and Republicans both so I guess that remains to be seen or whether I'm those comments and the chronicles a endorsement are going to have any adverse effect on the Republicans but certainly hope it doesn't often\nDo you remember ... all over I Do remember low dollar remember what a lower offer said that I got him kicked off the ballot he was supporting the Republican nominee\nYeah he was so my question is you know a lawyer ... Democrats for DNA is said uh I think he said basically it was going to support us I don't even think he said he was he was going to vote for he just said he'd prefer like some type of Republican over Democrat\nAnd lo and behold the Democrats are so outraged by Lloyd all over\nThe was it the the Tea Party Democrat as he called himself there are so upset about that Tea Party Democrat they kicked him off the ballot will that happen here\nI think it's too late though 'cause I was in a primary situations I don't think they're going to kick them off the ballot but I\nI understand in in its position because he's a very strong candidate county wide and he doesn't\nReally necessarily need every single Democrat to win or every single Republican to win because he does have enough crossover appeal\nBut wasn't necessary in this instance to take that last jab because I'm not saying this is and it's less than you are less term once he wins wasn't necessary or was that just the ... punish shot to go as he leaves his last election\nSo if you're looking at a strategically it could be necessary because you have a we have like\nThis over tone of a bad two and a him pushing for Harris County\nAnd likely to win Harris County question should become how much does better when Harris County by does he want to buy ten Fifteen Percent like Hillary did uh two years ago or does he just barely when it or even hypothetically lose it\nLike with uh like Ted Cruz his election six years ago where Ted Cruz just squeaked Harris County\nHe did and and and that's the thing with the county so competitive I'm shocked I Am truly shocked that the Harris County Republican Party chairman would not have that discussion with Emmett proud of making such a bold statement but what I what I Am I shocked that he didn't know I'd probably lying if I say I'm shocked well that's\nKind of go to that just just a minute that this thing to Carla you're on TALK about that when\nYou're off just for a minute on this because you got the ... the financial chair of a of the Republican Party who also is very influential in a in an organization and that organization endorses Democrats\nSo I you have that kind of time on\nA date or a PC who endorsed Democrats or Republicans you know that do it did primarily doors Republicans it's a little legend Republican organization that does support Democrats to deny that is to be dishonest and you have someone with such\nClose alliance to the Republican Party\nI'm that kind of that brings me some pause it also brings me some pause at the consulting for the local Republican Party\nIs tied in with the Strauss and it it's just an excruciating moderate all this tied together with gas too was on the air saying vote for a ... you know Paul Simpson it was at him at\nNo so no I don't don't say anything so\n[laughter] so you you see all this stuff going on all this you know Lucy goosey Republican near a weekend you know playing foot Caesar Democrats you ... you know you wonder is this like inside job to sabotage in some certain races I don't know I Hope it's not going to be positive about it\nBut take gum you know I ... [laughter] there's a lot there\nAnd that's the thing they you know the party has given a full resources to estimate ... in the likes like Sarah Davis who's very competitive district herself\nUm and there's always that preach about big tent when we take a shot at a alter right conservative like damn Patrick is it has kind of Republican Party truly a big tent party now ours and just saying if you're not moderate yeah\nProbably don't have a spot here for you yeah well I I don't know I mean those are the questions are probably going to answer soon enough big\nTent when it's convenient for the party whenever you're paying to play it's big tent so let's kind of maybe turn the page\nWe have the election coming up that is true in you know today's special guest is\nThere's going to be county commissioner did offer secretaries visiting her lab is going to be a good time but\nYou know while she was too busy I guess doing what she was doing a you know\nFighting jak jak Mormon got in there and he won he won by doing just doing the basic bangs going door to door letting everybody know that it was time for a change she is going to do a good job and\nThe guy has it really has done a good job I don't see him losing a precinct too I just don't see it he is running such a tight campaign he's been everywhere if you're in if you're an precinct to you're going to walk around and you're just going to see 'em just just driving by that guy's everywhere in precinct to\nAny of that there's there's just like a a bike show you're going to see him\nThey everywhere and it's a question I mean Adrian\nYou know got got elected and I think it's two thousand eight I'm first a sheriff's Tommy Thompson times Thomas and you've got to keep in mind at that time there was some internal issues going on with the ... uh the Thomas campaign and the administration and so that's how I was able to do to get the confidence of the the kind of people but a recall buck um\nMove on to a gym you there Jim\nHey Jim ... Jim\nI don't know you there Jim I'm I'm I'm yeah I'm here a year me yeah so what's going down there next show\nHey Shannon Shannon just answered\nThe phone I Love you all that shit and I continuously support and I had a quick question in regard to a lot\nOver here a car loaded actually\nOf Facebook friend and I heard about it with his promotions on his Facebook Live right now\nBut what's the Kurds are they going around you and then I'm\nNot one L year at southern university Thurgood Marshall school of law and I just wanted that summit bite\nIn regards to pursuing my career as an attorney is there any advice that you might have before I finished it I graduate as far as positioning myself in a in a way where I can you know maximize my opportunities I um I definitely\nWant to make sure I deserve an absolutely network and wonder if\nYou want to build your network that's the best thing you do I know a lot of people are going to focus on getting good grades makes you at the top of your class and that that's important to make sure you pass but your network is going to be the thing to measure success all\nOr nothing politically involved because law in politics go hand in hand and one way or the other you're always going to be involved somehow and the more you know the more people you know what's going to enhance your network but it's also going to give you brighter minds to surround yourself with\nAnd is going to surround yourself with people actually make decisions once they get elected or on the bench you know you'll you'll have that opportunity to know their mindset because you you ... converse with them you hang around with them and you know work with them so nobody network okay\nI'll do it more than that work with judges and other politicians and other people outside of the industry or is it better to connect with attorneys or is it just like a an inconvenient weight was sort of get stuck in a circle\nI Would say both you wanna you wanna you wanna meet and talk with as many people as you can because the non attorneys wound up being your clients attorneys you'll end up dealing with there'll\nBe friends they'll mentor some anti ...\nI'm just people that you pick you pick each other's mind because\nA\nGold man don't forget your\nClassmates too because those are people that you're going to continue to network with the rest of your career and you don't know what they're going to do a ... as as they progress that there are legal career and you you're going to touch base with them ...\n... and you you know you talk about the network or one of my friends you know I'm involved in young Republicans across the country and you know what am I\nMy network that method gifts and just joined a I'm On my life in in you know I've got people in New Jersey California Omaha who referred so just make sure you are building network and don't just stay local national networks thank you Jim\nHey yeah pretty much like hey we have a um it is hey man what's going down ... I I\nYeah I actually got on my you know it's interesting and exciting when we talk about politics in America\nThat's why I'm personally I'm writing a book going ... I mean you're gonna be am I going to end for America and I'm like a machine and I I'm a county go get them but the strongest Republican Democrat\nAnd then things can finally here\nBut you know what I Love America you know a lot of election year sixteen I was ... or the Democratic nominee for ... ... okay Dr I have a lot of a doctorate degree I cannot get Glen on hunger in all three [noise]\nI'm highly it ran short because then I found out I can beat me in the primary but that and that that's why I keep running because\nThe people they need to change and they get they love you I Am a lawyer or a businessman doctor what they want to buy the when the ... election they wouldn't know ball foreign name what's your hair because we all immigrants but people don't know why is that\nIf you have that kind of me and I'm actually kind of getting my son addict or county commission on that list show but I came to his daughter was in my mind like am I on a car but not like it I liked your game I\nI don't want us to Armand Gulf War we have to make sure we just look past names and we appreciate the\nCall and we really do man in a that sometimes the thank you so much and we're sorry we're just we're running out of time I didn't mean to really cut you off but with names or you just gotta keep running when I I have an odd last name or some people consider it a lot of different they did a lot of different people have different opinions on it\nAnd so again one last question in terms of ah probate while we have you know\nRe black hair does immigration anyway ... play a role in the court session here's county there's always that\nUh the issue of immigration pops up all my other does that play a role in the probate courts and if people are parents from another country wants to send their kids to ... Harris County to live with a relative do they need to go to the probate process for that [noise]\nWell it depends if if the school district which are often times needs someone with some legal authority to speak or make decisions on behalf of of the child who may be here\nOr you may actually have them ask that a a guardian get appointed for the minor to have some legal authority to make decisions for them and if that's true uh then of course the probate courts or the or the place to go that's where we do guardian chips\nAnd uh we do them for everybody who uh is a sitting in the statute a as\nA as someone who is as they claim incapacitated but being a minor is as part of the definition of being incapacitated and so they fit um end of the system and uh as needed we take care of those miners it's not uncommon and it doesn't have to just be with the school district we\nSee that all the time when we talked earlier about personal injury cases per century cases affect everybody doesn't matter whether US citizen or not in your case may end up in probate courts so we cover all facets of that and\nAnd while we don't deal with immigration directly we certainly deal with people who have an issue [noise]\nThank you guys don't forget about elections coming soon thank you so much a rape black he's just he's a great guy he is a reason\nYou know ray is on again one of
