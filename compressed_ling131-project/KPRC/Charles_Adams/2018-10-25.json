correct answer relation yeah I didn't get it out than that\nI couldn't remember the player member the place specifically could remember the player fires Richard has a question from here inside of babies cafe Richard read this microphone if you will is that we can hear your question loud and clear what's your question for coach Applewhite\nColors first of all things that kids for another great Google in every state that absolutely a ... at the game I was watching Witherspoon warm up and on the open and he was missing them to the right\nSo how how ironic it first chance to kick it's in the clothes and I guess you over compensated thinking it might go ride again do these players come to you\nBefore the start of the game and let you know how are their coach you know how they're warming up so that you have some sense of you know what may happen there will always\nWith the ... you know right before we go back out you know for the\nLast time you go out and you go in and out of seven hundred times by the way it makes no sense at all but when you come up the last time with the flags and the band you're actually going to play the game\nWe we we get together have where it's got to have it whereas comfortable which hash if we have to you know so you go both ways all say All right towards our locker room where he comfortable towards our locker room gotta habits pay away from my walk her uncomfortable away from my locker room got to have it\nPrefer preferable ... away from our locker room so we know you know we're what we're working towards that way I can tell Kendall how you got to get this on the right ... and you got to get in size thirty five yard line for us to even have a shot\nAppreciate the question right there ... sir just had a conversation with a bar Morgan you have a lot of smart people around you I've\nNoticed yeah you you want to be the dumb guy in the room [laughter] I Know you want to be the dumb gathering I've done a pretty good job of doing that you don't have to search rate hearty now he's great\nEnergy energy you know kids it's so hard to get people's attention now know number one they're just they're they're everybody's basically that nobody can focus for longer than eight seconds on anything so you have to have people that are engaging yep and people that\nPeople want to be around and they want to spend their time with when they do have loose time they don't want to play Fortnite they'd rather go sit in his office for Fifteen twenty minutes and ask him about his wife or his daughter his experiences and that's what he is he's engaging or he's got great energy about him you have seen our guys improve\nI Know we're all her critics you know fans the fanatics right I mean just look the definition of we're all the way we're very critical I Am too\nBut I've watched our guys improve and they're going to get there I mean believe we're going to challenge Saturday I mean there's no doubt but that's great that's great challenge we'll see how much we've been ... and I'm very positive about our team we've got a damn good football team and we're gonna play really good football team Saturday but I'm proud of the way our guys are in prison\nAnd how much they are listening to coach Morgan how engaged they are with him and how regardless of having a newborn his father had his chest opened up last week had open heart surgery\nAnd he's getting ready for triple option and so his dedication to his players and the things that he's going through and how open he is an extra time he spends our players see that and there's a there's a deep level of respect and so those are the kind of people you want to bring an extra knows and arrows and all that that's great that's great but you got to bring in positive people to\nYeah they can tell he has the attention of everybody as soon as they start speaking to things that he mentioned that you know the family and very important for you other people's families are going off saying your family bringing the family up every now and then whenever it's allowed having that bond with all of the families within your coaching staff wise that so important for you and what do you do to to build that support\nIs important because I've been in this business long enough not long but I've been long enough to know that that's what's going to matter so hum when you're in you're around the hall of fame coach goes brown backgrounds going in the hall of fame this year\nAnd he he gave the University of Texas you know a phenomenal sixteen Fifteen Years and they got rid of them yeah and at the end of the day I Wonder how many of those people are sending letters and text messages and emails that all cheer for probably nobody\nSo it's probably him his wife and kids and they're they are what matter we get paid a lot of money more than we should\nAnd it's a great business to be in and it's awesome and it's fun and you get to be around kids but you you often spend a lot of your time around your fans around your alumni around your players instead of your own wife and kids and so when you do have those windows as a coach\nI don't want I don't want to look up not no lie low or Nash and I don't think my kids are any more important to somebody else's kids so I'm One of our coach is to have to be around their kids and I want them to be able to use their time with their families the way they want\nOne of the things that he mentioned that I heard a players say in a post game interview a few weeks ago talking about how hard this team practices and how much desire to have when they practice coach mentioned that that I think it was Roman brown had mentioned that after a game a little bit earlier this season what have you noticed about your players and then how hard they practice this year\nWell I think it's twofold it goes back and forth um we've we've got a great group of guys you know number one players but players you know that they have to be in the right environment and that right environment is set by guys like ... you know like when more\nUm you know like coach guiding light coach browse by coach pope that they have to set the mood in terms of making football fun\nAnd then whenever football's sun and it's not work\nYou know that's what we tell our guys were not working he wants to work looking back on the on the open that orange science to diplomats work what we're doing is playing were playing football so let's go have fun and the great environment is coaches and strength staff and trainers and managers and it's fun out there\nYou know we don't we don't work or go into Rico conduct businesses coaches we don't work there's a lot of people that work in this world we are not working they were having fun we're playing and conducting\nBusiness Josie as a microphone Josie started to keep you waiting thanking them go kids go ...\nAre real people have a question they asked uh uh Austin Robinson and a half his eligibility standards kind of been some controversy in all the you know his his uh\nHe he got his letter in in January from the inside of a way to get his his extra year and that was something we weren't sure he was going to get\n'em from his transfer from UTSA to Houston I'm so his helix by it he's done after this year so there's this when he got his last year he's playing his last year out\nUm and just a phenomenal I say kids because I'm old enough because these guys are kids but he's a young man and he is a\nWorked his tail often and has an engineering degree from the University of Houston uh parents are highly educated sisters educate a lives up there are tours of Maryland and she's in Virginia actually she was there at the game that chance to see her great family\nOnce a marine always a marine what if in American citizens are fed up with the republic bureaucracies do with these leaders the decision that we are the last defense against an invasion force an invasion force should echo from year to the border and to the heavens so there's that\nOr this brand rather should I go from here to the heavens cheers a mud Matthew\nI'm I ... well the the point is that the border patrol has and tell people not to come into the country illegally uh but what I Will tell you many others won't is that they're they're abusing the process\nRight now by ... they're not technically illegals and I we all need to understand this if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they claim that they are incredible fear of their lives uh there was you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using 'cause they've been told this is what they should say\nThey're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals when they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings\nOr or if they're at their hearings they are told that they must leave the country and they don't\nBut it's important to get all this right and they're not technically illegals\nIf they show up at a port of entry or even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very deep I shouldn't say laws asylum process is very favorable to anyone who shows up in the United states and and claims that they have an asylum case so we gotta gotta remember that uh she Jay right\nIt's a book about these bomb packages I Know it's too early to tell the monies that it was the Russians they know both sides blame each other and they're bored or thereby resulting in more political chaos similar to how Russia is paid for political ads on both sides on the twenty sixteen election and promote disdain\nTJ my friend I I Can't tell you if you're right or wrong on this one I all I can tell you is that um\nYou know we don't know if we really just have no idea um you know we don't we don't know who's behind this we know that it's a\nIt's a terrorist act and that's that's kind of were asked to leave it for now I I don't know the speculation at some point can lead you down a road of\nWell let's just say that it was it turns into more wild guess territory you're really not helping yourself or anybody else out so I'm trying to I'm trying to withhold my found this and how you guys know that ... ... when they're tough call then I feel strongly about them I'll make it right away\nAnd and I knew right away that it was the fix was in against Kavanaugh and that that was all hit that was a an ambush\nUm but you know that that\nThat this one I just can't tell you that I have enough of a enough of a sense of what's going on to to go to deep into it I'm gyms\nTelling the truth and gas is there a part of me that thinks that if you were trying to\nCreate a lot of sympathy for the Democrats are and for the last right before an election that this sure that everyone is thinking that in the back of their minds but that's not enough to say well that's what I really believe that's what the evidence leads me to believe is happening that's a different thing\nAries writes a brilliant analysis as it concerns the media's propaganda toward Trump\nThey'll sign a simultaneously say somebody a Trump is in students pocket while saying he will start a nuclear arms race with Russia\nMaybe they're flipping out over Trump's handling of the show the incident try to create a narrative that Trump is in a K essays pocket\nBecause the king of Saudi Arabia because the narrative him being Russia's pocket isn't working out so well funny how you call the situation with kids and turkey like a scene out of the Sopranos I thought the best way to handle it it was like a scene out Sopranos especially dealing with these characters\nMax Boot is a disgrace I have a few of his books I won't be buying any more\nBy the way speaking of jackass is did you see Don limit reading the ten commandments with Max Boot on air and how Trump is violated\nThem uh men\nThere you go aries things right and then I always know that\nWhen I when I get ... areas as part of that is part of that\nScene but crew when when they write in telling me I'm doing good on something I Know I'm really really do an excellent stuff you're doing really good work because if I'm if I'm mailing it in a little bit which I never do but if I'm just not\nYou know if I'm not a hit and triples and I'm just getting on first base with some part of the show I'll hear about it I'll hear about it uh so I appreciate that area's thank you for writing then I'm\nTired of the book I Can't believe you haven't mentioned the assassination of general ... an attempted assassination of General Mills in Afghanistan last week there are a lot of us veterans who depend on you to help the country remember that we're still fighting Afghanistan\nYou spent a lot of time talking about the show the but not on ... what's up with that I'm giving you a partial past because the midterms but I just uh but just you know I'm disappointed oh as as Tabitha Tabitha you're you're right you're right\nIt it it's not a wasn't a a conscious choice I just got caught up in the news cycle you know day to day out like everybody else that's that is trying to put together a Daily Show and a and I I uh I missed the\nI missed the boat on this one um yes there was an attempted assassination of a U.S brigadier general in Afghanistan insider threat Taliban infiltration this keeps happening and uh and and they got a general a rustic and Afghan general\nAnd you know now they're going after senior military a very very senior military officers and we can't protective or senior military officers the masters of that sends all the way down\nThe uh the chain of command is no one safe anywhere in Afghanistan now that that's the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not look we're not when the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either in Afghanistan we're losing our area of control is receding\nAnd we think that because we don't have that many of our soldiers doing frontline patrols everyday that they're not\nQuite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way that would be at other stages of this war but there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's going to be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women are going to be the ones that have to keep ... from falling\nSo a tablet thank you for
