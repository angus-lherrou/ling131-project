I like big cities I like things um where you have multiple things to do you know and um I got kids that are all active and stuff so it's always great to be in a big city and then you're in a warm weather climate you know so [noise] um [noise]\nA little different of champagne Illinois [laughter]\nAbsolutely so it's a it's a really good city so\nWhat are some of the core principles as soon as you get a quarterback whether it's a newcomer whether it's somebody you've had for a while what are the core principles that you have pillars of success that you have for your\nCorner I think though the number one thing you try to do you try to find out and it's always hard as how competitive they are yeah you know because that's one of those positions you're gonna win some are you going to lose some but if you got a kid that competitive and it's hungry you know and um once they get better it starts with that\nYou know and then um [noise] you got to have one or two things right you got it he he liked to have a big corner to ride but they don't necessarily have to be if the corner you could be five ten five eleven God is is a good athlete so the second criteria is you want to have an excellent athlete\nYou know so if you can get a competitive guy just accent an athlete\nUm [noise] then the other stuff you can kind of I was in town of train them you know you can kind of develop um you know some of them come come in in a great pack where most of them aren't great tablets you know so everybody talking about corners just plant I'm\nJust playing a ball and plan man coverage but it's it's more to it than that you know you try to develop all make 'em well rounded guy so\nWhat are the things you mentioned is that you you win some you lose some I feel like quarterback is one of the the most difficult positions to play in terms of the psychology of the game especially nowadays in college football where it's the norm to score thirty forty fifty points and how much do you do you work on the psychology of the game of hey you know the big play you gotta you gotta forget it you\nYou know but no not not a whole bunch Halloween why's now it's all about our kids you know go on

Nineteen yard to be here two hundred and sixty three yards on the ground we talked a really in great detail about the hurricane but just the overall performance of the office\nOn Saturday well all of them you know just continue to play at a high level that could have a lot of confidence you know and that's a you know something that's fun to watch you know you see guys with confidence go out there and expect to make plays they prepared that way all week\nUh stay aggressive on the office of man\nA coach browse done a great job with that our our guys feed off of that and and players do whether you're calling blitz is from a defense of perspective calling fakes from a special teams perspective or or throwing the ball deeper running trick place from an office perspective\nIt breeds confidence into your players and so I saw a guy I spoke with tremendous confidence and a no matter what the circumstances were there it got really tight\nI'm there to begin the third quarter but our guys just you know kept their head down kept folks and kept making plays and you know as we took the ball away defensively to swoop all the way\nI Want to ask you about a couple of those trick or treat plays a
