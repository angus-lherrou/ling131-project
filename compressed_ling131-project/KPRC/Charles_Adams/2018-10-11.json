Austin or was it was much more police and the way we Tom droplets has seemed to hit things close your line of scrimmage and ... and sometimes that can be hard and this\nYou know in these spread systems were just constantly looking back and forth back and forth it can be difficult to time some of those things up because the quarterbacks indicator changes quite a bit\nMuch you know it's it's anything in life I mean\nPressure pressure makes it harder and all of us you know and so that's that's that's the thought process with the quarterback you know when you're five feet away it's fairly easy to accomplish something to do one foot away it's held a lot harder\nYeah uh you mentioned whenever you know you're showing the blitz and you're trying to time it exactly right so you're you know whoever's blessing issue she shows ... sometimes the other team will pick up on that they'll see that the the guys but let's say no check out of whatever they're checking out of you know how often does the deep bench counter now that they kept their hand in what we sit there and we'd better check out of the\nYeah we've got we've got that part of our package too they check we check and you know and and again it's it's\nWithout getting into too many secrets a lot of it is how much time do you have the check what's the you know what kind of blitz do you have on maybe it's a list that you want to keep it is good for everything yeah and I were not checking out of this this is fine this is an an exotic bless this is something that we're OK with and it's got answers\nUm then there's times where you know\nOr have they got us All right we've got to get out of this okay let's get out of this one and then there's times where have you know they did this so late in the and the clock that ... we we just can't get into this call so we're gonna have to let it ride player rules\nAh but yeah I mean that you know obviously you want to hide everything to the last second you want to time every one of them not perfect but that's why you see one guy you know collapse when God does verbal one guy raises leg one guy drops his finger down there's a thousand different indicators quarterback ask for the football with\nAnd that change 'em up during games and sometimes they double cadence of doubling the gate and they can\nHappy to have you with us so as we've been doing on the last few weeks

American Conference week in review is we take a look at the American conference standings ensuring play this week\nThe east division has three to another team Cincinnati UCF in temple all its you know since he ran over twenty five UCF number ten in the country\nUs ... to ... to get home later this season right number twenty three in the country there want to know each Carolina oh until you got his own three meanwhile on the west Houston it want to do the only undefeated team in the western division SMU maybe two lane meant\nThose three teams are wanting one Memphis is wanting to\nAn Tulsa is it oh it too and he had a question for head coach major rap white and you're here inside of babies cafe there is a wireless microphone to my left just get the microphone get our attention and we'll get to your question for head coach major Applewhite again I don't know if we'd given away the trivia question but how many career one hundred yards rushing games this year a king now have\nThe rainy climates coach what does he meant to your program\nA lot of I mean I'm not trying to think about where to start off um [noise]\nYou know it's kind of when you asked me about Kendall the same things in terms of just confident number one a confident number to the right type of confidence uh [noise]\nYou know versatile from the standpoint of you know it's it's not a one size fits all the way he teaches um you know very confident I'm very confident in what he does a beacon\nCoach different types of body types different types of flexibility different types of puts the guise different ways [noise] it's not you know it is my way or the highway but it's not my technique was the only technique right what I'm trying to [noise] um [noise] you know probably more creative than the most lined coaches it up and around that kind of know what they know\nAnd uh they're not really willing to kind of get out on a limb and try different a technique or try different run scheme and\nUm but he also at the same time he has a firm belief and in his technique and and the way to run as often said one room and those those principles are are non negotiable in his mind and so\nThe you know he does come with some hard you know pillars of of line play\nOf innovative creative confident confidence uh all those great things you just in more than anything you're still dealing with kids people either you know the kids they're Eighteen to twenty two years old they're not like pro athletes are much more like high school athletes so confidence is a big issue\nAnd you have to kind of you know and probably the most insecure creatures on this planet or Eighteen to twenty two year old man yeah so you have to have somebody is very confident in themselves and somebody is very positive\nAnd he brings a level of positivity and toughness all the same time and\nUh it's a joy having him around a working with our law and his wife Holly is great um she's she's all about it you know spent ... for a long time and a lot of different places and she's a very appreciative I can just tell on game day she's all in it as well so it just is a blessing to have a great family\nUh as as part of you know you're you ate football family\nAnd good success so far number one of the nation and sex allowed only one of those you can tell he's not somebody that really appreciate he doesn't want the race he likes to look like the phrase which is something that you see for a lot of coaches but the ... lines so far only giving up one sack the rushing game has been very good what is your assessment of the office of line through five games\nOf everything that you just said I'm not to not to put it to several but just continue to build on that continue to grow and you know that's a that's a group that doesn't get a lot of highlights a you know it doesn't get a lot of credit obviously we all know that is sports fans\nUm you know so when they do get their first you know Twitter graphic of hey only want to say given up you're like come on guys like don't show them that they never get anything you know so\nUm but you know but there again that's that's all the experience you know all those great attributes are great about coach going as I just mentioned but that's what he's done that for a long time so he has great experience and so he knows how to head off some of those things keep guys hungry from week to week\nI wanted to go back to something you said about the versatility of coach and this is generally speaking not just about coach Clements but how important is it to have that versatility as a coach and not the whole you know round pegs square hole mindset\nUm it it is difficult you know and it's um it's it's interesting you know I'm kind of right in the middle\nIn terms of college age coaches you know you've got some guys are twenty five twenty six in the business of some guys are in early sixties and their business and just kind of right in the middle and you hear both sides of the you know ... you really do you hear ... kids ... doesn't know anything about recruiting haven't been through it and a half years and he had seen this the way I've seen it\nAnd then you're over on the other side and they're like well this is the way I've always done it and this is the ways this has stood the test of time and this is the way I'm going to do it and it's like well\nDamn both y'all are stubborn you know there's a lot to learn you know both ways and and I think it's a lot of ways I think is more impressive when you have someone\nWho's extremely experience so I don't like say the word old I don't think you can say that I think that's politically incorrect na da Vinci was talking about I was very experienced in the in the coaching profession has been around for a long time\nI think it's it's interesting when that person says now this is what I Believe this is what I've always done but I see the ... and this I'd like to experiment with this I'd like to try this you don't hear that from a lot of coaches who've been in the business for a long long time\nAnd most of them are very slow to change so uh I think that's a ... that can be a strength and as long as you have your like I said those pillars of what you believe in as a coach and and when something operates outside of that and then obviously you can't get on board with it but to to open yourself up to different ideas different ways of doing things I think just instrumental to continue to grow as a coach\nI wanted to ask you about the office of assessment we got into it a little bit are opening segment but the numbers three hundred and sixteen rushing yards a hundred and sixty by passing yards at times it was really good at times it was a little bit quiet overall what did you think of the off into performance\nWhen they're you know and and and honestly what I think overall I think any time that you could turn the ball over three times run for over three hundred yards you school forty one points and be pissed off I think he did a good job if that makes sense you know but that being said the wind is the ultimate goal but how do we go back and\nEliminate these three turnovers how do we go back and eliminate a seven yards third quarter where where are our issues yes I mean it's it believe me this isn't one of those deals where we all have five each other and throw down a Gatorade and lock room and say well God that one's over whether or not to worry about no you go back you examine and on Sunday\nYou make sure have ... where was our issues coming out the box you know where we are as you coming out in third quarter why do we start off this way\nUm you know we we didn't start off this way the week before against actually started we didn't start off this way you know in the first quarter against you know against a Texas Tech and we didn't start off the way the third quarter went down and scores of what what was the issue in this game\nYou know when there's always a pleasure of issues it's a well we didn't get this blocks will just put his behind on second down and then we have this ball there was a little bit out of this breach and there's always a thousand reasons but when those reasons start to line up with stuff that we're doing by the way we're coaching things and that's uh\nRecently where we pay close attention would change if\nYou brought up earlier how the hurricane has been showing your good signs of being a leader and I remember hearing stories back when he was a freshman that he was kind of the leader of that freshman class or something that he's been doing for a long time about how are you still seeing him grow in that leadership role for your team\nWell just the same way he's he's I guess he's always grown I mean I I see it on the sideline um confidence you know a little bit more\nOf our state will get more he's always have tremendous respect from the teammates that's not what I'm trying to save but just\nA he's just the his his voice has gotten bigger um he doesn't abuse it you know he's not one of these guys are like oh my God what he ever shut up but not like that at all I mean he's very poignant when he needs to say something he says it and he's clear and concise with it and then he moves on but\nThe scope of his leadership that's what I'm trying to say this go you know not just a quarterback room not just the quarterbacks and the White House and not just the off and so the old line but it's going across the ball and I see him go down there a couple of Haiti could stop where to go see the ball and you start to see at work as well you know way across the football so\nIt's working more with the team and he's earned it you know and that's it's hard to get that kind of leadership\nA role unless you really weren't your tail up and you've earned it\nWe're going to take a quick break away come back we'll get to some of the Twitter questions that are coming in at UH cougar F.

friend of mine is one who said it to me once but it's it's an important point who told you come into the world to be happy the answer is nobody really we are led to believe that by the society around us especially by the more\nCommercial and a self indulgent aspects of the society around this now because we live lives of\nWhat would have been inconceivable comfort if even a hundred years ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole\nAnd happiness is not just about pleasure that's really

regional after so furious and unhinged and so rabbit in their ... stations is because deep down they know they don't have logical on their side\nEvery one of their ideas when enacted results and failure they simply don't have a good historic track record so with logic and facts out the window they react emotionally I think Shakespeare put it best they'd dust protest too much\nShield childcare on the first of all props for getting the Shakespeare quoted the roll call always appreciate that\nAnd on July the left gets so upset yes I I think that the the weakness of their arguments is one of the reasons for their outrage right the the weakness of the arguments is one of the reasons that they are so\nUnreasonable when presented with the opposing point of view where people tell me I'm really wrong on something that I Know I'm right\nI don't get angry I tend to be pretty calm and serene and self assured\nIf somebody tells me that I'm wrong on something and my first instinct is oh gosh maybe I'm wrong I I can get a little defensive and I have to be aware of that because my initial impulse is to try and cover up for the fact that maybe I was wrong on something I think most people are a lot of people at least have that as a as a response\nBill of rights Tom Nichols announced his departure from the GOP in the Atlantic on MORNING Joe usually Morning Joe or rejoice at this

think at the end of the day he is a very well intentioned individual when it comes to this country and I I just I think he's so wrong on all this I really do and I don't engage with him any more publicly because\nI I don't think that he's fair minded about what he said recently on Twitter so I'm not betraying any confidence here but he said\nThat what the Democrats did the Kavanaugh was bad
