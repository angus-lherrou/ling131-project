I mean it's all it means in his high school yearbook and the idiocy of the Senate Democrats interrogating him about what Abou freezes if it's something nefarious it's just a far right\nSo this sounds so the back of my shirt said tell the truth about booth\nAnd not only that this is maybe the best part of this whole thing\nI Need the shirt made that needed it made fast so my wife my wife tells me there's this lady one of her friends one of her girlfriends in the neighborhood make sure she has to make T shirts at home and uh so I tell her kids she made one for me and my wife checks the girl says yes somebody wife asked what I Want on it\nAnd I have to tell her what she has to tell her girlfriend to print the shirt and\nAre there were questions asked you know and there were questions asked but either way so I decided I'm going to go undercover ... grab a microphone which is not hooked up to anything I get a couple of my buddies\nTo meet me back there in DC fly back and we decided to go undercover on the protest and hear all play you a\nClip or two of it you're going to want to get online and watch the video because the video honestly it could not have worked out any better I

have the one of the lady the young ladies surrounding me and yelling at me Chris hold on don't play that one yet so [laughter] I'm as you can see I'm interviewing these people and\nWell I'll get to their basic psychology and admitted at some point in time though I Do have a pretty large online following\nI have like Seventy four thousand Twitter followers not to brag like five thousand followers on Facebook it's it's that's significant so people recognize me when I go out places cause I stick out like a sore thumb so at some point in\nTime I was discovered a behind enemy lines [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] that\nLovely young lady was yelling at me or right at the base of the steps of the United States Supreme court so when they finally put me in the ground one day don't tell me I have an accomplished anything 'cause I got chewed out by a feminist on the Supreme Court the best part\nYou know what you have to go watch the video or the crowd is not necessarily agree with her that I'm the anti Christ\nAnd shanta storming off because everyone comes up they just wanted to shake their hands and take pictures with me and meet me the videos good\nGo see the video it's right there on KNPR see just click on my name or if you can't find it there you go to I Am Jesse duck cry of Jesse Kelly dot com but go to Kay PR see it's up there you will enjoy it\nI may or may not have run into Elizabeth Warren and you're going to want to see that exchange so All right back to the task at hand here I'm getting I'm way off track I had all

desk drawer somewhere that's a huge\nProblem fix it All right I get distracted anyway so I hear a lot of talk about how this Kavanaugh hearing\nWas ugly for the country because it made the courts look partisan see this all over the place I see from people in the right people on the left the courts are part of the now the court shouldn't be partisan the the court should be down the line\nOkay people it's grown up time of course the courts or partisan they are now they have always been there is no\nEnd because we love our country and it's a good thing we do this but there is no golden age thing in American politics or politics anywhere else were these fights didn't exist\n\nYou know why we have so many of these social programs that we were never supposed to have things like Social Security\nThings that are blatantly against what was in the constitution the things that are actually dollars and cents wise bankrupting the country do you know why we have them\n'cause they packed the courts\nBecause FDR packed accords there's bipartisan court there's no non partisan court there was a victory and there is losing and that's just the way it is the Supreme Court is not a non partisan\nSix months ago I mean I had no idea that we would be in the midst of and and I had hundreds and hundreds of people that have come live I I couldn't you can never back out of something like that\nBut that all said I Would next time around because I'm sure I'll be at the Vegas conferences same one next year or next time around I Will make sure that I'm On air every day 'cause I missed it I mean the friday I Would give myself because I Need a travel day\nBut I was itching to get on radio on Thursday man I really was so I I I think you you you make a fair point and I'm not going to be

I've I've got to do a lot of free TV I I've got a lot of hustling a lot a meeting with people greasing palms schmoozing and all this stuff with the executives and you know that's not what I like to do\nUm I have never in all my time now gosh six six years I think I don't know some of the original team buck there was no better than I Do what the what the start date was that the Saturday show but it was now going on six years ago I think it was six years\nIn July I've never not been happy to do my radio show not even one day not when I've had a migraine not one I've had food poisoning not it doesn't matter everyday I like doing the show\nMaybe that makes it a little crazy but and I hope it comes across in the product that I put out 'cause this this is my this is my jam\nOr Brennan writes

that I I don't personally look some of you choose not to curse it all your life and I think that's very admirable I just don't have that degree of\nOf restraints uh in my day to day discourse but I appreciate that you know there are people who write me really I'm really kind letters of support for it I Do and you know they'll tell me that the twelve year old was the show\nSo and I always keep that in mind you know and my parents listen to the show all the time too so\nYou know ... there's no there's no way I'm ever going to disappoint a ... the only the only missed the section that I Know

years ago and they your cars they were on satellite radio they just let it rep and I was\nLike okay I Am yes I suppose that's\n...
