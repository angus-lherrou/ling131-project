that you emphasize this week knowing that you're going to go from sixteen Seventeen possessions to maybe eleven twelve playing maybe we don't we don't we don't have many opportunities will have free

with those players but you got to make sure you group teach it's one thing to tell bow Alexander and keep score but hey we one of us has got to be off the ball here\nBut there's Courtney lark every

with that individual make sure the whole group understands\nI hesitate asking this question but you know you always want to have games where you have zero penalties but it is sometimes good to have those ... moments in a game especially a game that you control\n[noise] no I mean I don't I'm going to be perfectly honest I mean I have a perfect setting I don't ever want penalties yeah I'm I'm I'm Glad to get those penalties going in and and coach off of them with a twenty two point when but you know the the fact that they happen\nMakes you a little uneasy from the standpoint of what happens

assessment against east Carolina how would you grade out the offensive against the pirates\nNo explosive or I suppose to play you know we we we we didn't execute the way we always wanted to [noise]\nAh because we you know we kept getting our own waste I mean whether it was usually before to snap where there was a couple of false starts lining up um you know there were some things that we just gotten gotten her own way and create a down in business situations that are typical I don't care who you are now\nYou know second Twenty one first twenty those are difficult situations to get out of Bob but when we had opportunities to make some explosive plays for the most part we made them\nUm this is one of those games that was when you talked about penalties earlier\nThis is a good game to be able to going into the navy game to stay listening you know when you play against the microbes are sixty three times and you're going to get multiple possessions is not going to show up with this game that will this game that absolutely well you're going to get sick less possessions this game's going to end an hour earlier than normal games it's going to be a totally different feel so we've got to stay out of our way\nOffensive we put a you know please anytime you walk with a thirty five points on the road but but we could have played better and we know that we're we're going back to work to\nGet us all brought up the other named Patrick car we talked about the running backs Patrick car legit rushing you have to have a yard Thirteen carries what does he meant to your office and also what is what have you seen from Patrick car the first time you're laid eyes on I'm wearing the scarlet whites where he is now\nBook a coach posed aren't great job with all those guys and he's been around 'em you know for a long time seen a lot of different ... and you know I'm just got tremendous experience with working with bags and I've seen all of our backs up success underneath them\nPatrick's deal was ... you know the first thing you see is just the physical side of them you know he's a thick legs running trunk you know from\nA you know is just as waste his core I mean he's a tough guy to bring down great balance great speed loves the game goes hard same thing with ... um both of those guys I mean when you look at 'em you're like OK who's got a ride back [laughter] I Know so they both have those features but\nUm you know Patrick has just been consistent he's been you know he's getting better weekend the week out working on being more vertical runner and he's he's doing that and uh and he loves his team I mean that's the ones that you you can just tell he loves his team and he loves to work hard for me\nI'd be remiss if I didn't bring up can assault the gentleman we just talk to your running backs coach you as you can tell as a a a vast are\nA lot of experience in his days you write off some of the names here ... Thomas at all of those guys what does he bring to the coaching room\nFor the experience on the field you know having worked with a number of different types of players from different generations um experience as a as a man you know experience as a as a as a longtime assistant coach somebody that\nUh you know that I value when you're you're sitting there at the head of the table I mean you can act like you know at all or you can ask people questions and when you have somebody who's coasted along with the hasn't dealt with different generations of kids different types of parents in different situations [noise]\nUh is is opinions valuable and and on game day you know he's he's one of those guys but it's been around so long that you know his mindset is you know don't make a difficult now may have been around this a long time sometimes the answer is just keep running the counter [laughter]\nYou know we don't need to run a double reverse fascinating so he's there is a just a lot of common sense an experience that is tremendous bar program got great personality the kids love 'em I'm you know our our our guys are talking to coach ... you know you see it on Friday nights we have our family friday\nAnd this is you know this is an awesome part of what we do in terms of the night before the game will have our typical meetings you know a lot of our chapel we'll have our team meal on friday night\nThen we'll have often said to me for about twenty minutes and then we have about an hour and a half two hours where we left the guys because they've been working hard in the classroom working hard on the field pull out the cards the dominoes jak for will throw up the friday night football game and his chance for everybody kind of relax a little bit enjoy the family aspect of it\nAh and I always enjoyed watching coach pope because he gets those bones in just goes to work I mean he just absolutely teaches lessons dome over there on the dominant you know he's a he's a master a over there so I Love watching him and he's just got a great personality the kids want to be around him and\nHear those stories butter Dickerson and very standards and all the guys and he's been around um this is what family supposed to be about\nIt I I laugh a little bit whenever you said that sometimes the best idea to run a counter and how to reverse passed but you did that again these Carolina you had to give it certainly has been through a bar to the end zone for the score a what you see that you don't do that play and just what you said on bill that you thought in my work\nWhat we we talked about during the week we actually I'm a member of the conversation we just talking with Kendall it was brought up in there in the room do we want to hand it to Bryson or do we want him to go beyond the quarterback and throw it to him\nAnd you know I remember making eye contact kennel we want to throw it to them you know even though it's difficult to catch the ball show at talking to bring it back into passengers wants price and catches a flare up there is a little bit of a a finality of the play like All right that's ... that's the cat yeah let's come up and go try to tackle number one\nAnd I'm so we decided to go with little swing pass and we threw out there to Bryce and I mean it looked like Kendall says it looked like pre practiced like you're just out there goofing around with a ball and\nHe caught it in three steps later I mean through a strike to keep corporate I mean put it in his face mask it wasn't just a close bond and it was as close as you put it in his nostrils I mean it was a perfect for you know and uh you know and he just made it look like\nYou know oh home you know and\nYou know you're sitting out there watching some of those classes both teams didn't even catch the other night we had one more question catch they had to he caught it took two steps that there were a corner out on top of his so he's an exceptional athletes were fortunate blessed to have\nAnd I were keep finding ways to get the ball and gray explosives like that\nOne of the things you always hear people say whenever you how to play like that is why did they show that against this specific opponent but some of that stuff is what you see on film to that effect right [noise]\nYeah I I Would say this about coach browsing and in our office in general the way we're we're not holding anything back if we practice that we're going to call it\nAnd the way we look at it as score now when now you know all the best laid plans of mice and men all that stuff down the line kitt [laughter] forget that nice for you but you know let's just let's just Gore score and put it on tape and then that's just one more thing that they've got to worry about\nWhat are some of the things that are going on in the headsets on game day oh there's no telling [laughter] from eight to ... you know that\nOn south is you know in the grass [laughter] you know it's it's it's a lot of communicating the biggest thing to to for us is just how do we the communication flow you know our eyes or you know you're not not being negative but you're not a fan watching exactly what you're supposed to watch I don't have the information broken down into the simplest form I don't\nNeed you know how to build a watch and you know what time it is and we all need to know it quickly and the Kendal says what's the ...\nBridget not well it might be ... its quarters or its cover to say it in and shut up because you've got to think same thing defensively so you don't want a lot of ways to talk you don't want the dirt or for al Michaels up they're calling the game by any almost broke attack like Josh yeah you know let these guys think they're calling the game [noise]\nUm so it's it's a lot about you know there's a lot of talking after a series is over off as just like the differences bulletins or coverage is what they're doing on this down this guys having problems with this block we might need to do this they're starting to do this now I'm\nStarting show this look from last game that we saw on tape you know this is where they're headed this is what our answers need to be that's an officer deal defensively you know and it's it's this guy went out this corner got injured we saw walk off the field with the taxes new corner next to a thousand things but that's where the majority of the talking is\nDuring the series there's very little uh you know there's a different channel for an office declined coaching his da to kind of go over to channel be\nAnd talk about more of the run game in the front and then staying away stays open a for coach browse myself and other assistance from the skill side of it and you know goes browse myself but what you thought very quiet so we can concentrate on what he needs and then\nYou know you may have a wide receiver coach step in and say mark was turned his ankle he's out just to give the guy indicator I may jump in and say hey Kendall just as for down territory now you know just a week instead of secrets to play up so we can go for a fork down but very little talking if possible\nYeah that's good stuff they're going to take a quick break away come back we can open it up to anybody in diabetes cafe a question for coach apple I we have a microphone to my left and you want to tweet it and you can't at our Bud Light inbox at UH cougar ask me all of that and more coming up next the major Applewhite Joe [noise]\nThe wings stop a radio about that can't be stopped there is no way you could look away but this is radio don't

well John I Would say that it's not an admission of guilt but yes it's been a mission that it was Obama administration policy to ignore\nSo the law that Obama did not like I'm so yes that that is a thing that the Obama administration would do and it leads to lawlessness unless it is for a very specific reason and it's a it's John Ford true\nA resource and prosecutorial discretion justifications

great show Katie thank you for your great message now I Need some advice to help resolve a political dispute\nMy dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi we're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who is skewing the truth to the point of lies and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes\nThe other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either\nBut for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty Kennedy that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust devote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion Katie Katie a very very a thoughtful question from you thank you so much for writing it\nUm [noise] well you know since I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised this is just a question\nOf establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations is is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want or act the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want in a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue of it I think that\nUh principles are most important for you and your day to day life but principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and to have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless so I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle of image look what happened with justice Cavanaugh\nI I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now that varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's\nPeople who are who are\nGrotesque and and deeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take\nA trustworthy on policy but shady personally conservative or Republican or Tea Party or whatever over a\nUpstanding but legislatively on palatable Democrat I suspect\nRobin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive snowflakes\nAre they are completely ignorant of Langston which they distort truth to make their agenda seem plausible there are so ignorant they can't see their own delusions and so delusional they can't see their own ignorance it's psychosis which requires a diagnosis hey look it rhymes\nI didn't Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there\nIs no area in which they can see truth\nHuh Interesting\nThank you so much writing and yeah I Do think that there is a a mass hysteria and really a mass psychosis that has overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks it's short shouting regarding Elizabeth Warren here are some fun nicknames a liar walk the fraud resume a\nFake a jewelry or I guess instead of ... we're out of course Pocahontas and Pocahontas Michael well Michael you are certainly a creative fellow appreciate you writing and sat\nNext step here he says I have no idea why no one has said the possible murder and Turkey's Islamic problem with my three combat tours in the middle east as an infantryman I never saw stories of babies rounded ovens dead families to include journalists make them short of please\nA wise on so that ... is turkey is as long as problems ... um yeah you know ... you're not hearing any criticism of Islam you're only hearing criticism of Saudi Arabia in this whole uh this whole murder and\nThat's not by accident the left is very quick to criticize religion that has not Islam\nBut it's very fond of\nDefending Islam at every turn even even radical and and more extreme interpretations of Islam\nWhich is really where the problem was so there you go I'm Jen writes the way you hear the news talk about the reporter at first I thought it was one of ours this is not our issue not our citizens not our our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue with Trump hadn't just succeeded in getting our pastor back\nHalf of draw attention away from that to something we have no control over I

I don't know what you're going to call it ... music do get your do you do get a map to him in crime in the afternoon or you know put on some Chinese I don't know [noise] speaking of putting all pain is wearing you'll during the second about doing update you with this week we talked about the ... the two thousand fourteen lawsuits filed by students\nFor fair admissions against Harvard University\n[noise] those students Asian American students sued for discrimination we I I didn't realize when I first talked about it's not a jury trial to travel to a judge in Boston which seems tactically a bad idea\nThat you're trying to get a ruling the Harvard University very powerful in Massachusetts I'm discriminated against Asian students I don't I I Would speak directly to a jury myself but that's what's going on um they had the uh one\nOf the longtime dean they call them the gatekeeper of Harvard testified today he testified that they would send out recruitment letters\nTo students\nBased on SAT scores the SAT is now back to sixteen hundred you it was originally a sixteen hundred score went up to twenty four want to know removed tobacco sixteen hundred [noise] um they send out the recruitment letters at eleven hundred which is a decent score but it's a mediocre score\nFor the it it's it's not an acceptable score for Ivy League schools but they would send those letters out to African American Native American and Hispanic American high schoolers\nSo if you fit this profile you got eleven hundred Chris how how do you think you'd have to score as an Asian student to get a recruitment butter\n[noise] Thirteen eighty four men Thirteen fifty for women [noise] which is\nAn amazingly high school a top one percent score a huge difference and then they ... but his position was that it wasn't that all\nDiscriminatory he testified Harvard never considers of applicants race to be a negative\nWell when you're admission\nOr you're attracted to this is defined by your race it supersedes your academic performance\nI think your alarm [noise]\nUm the explanation was that the school\nWas not being discriminatory instead it was trying to break the cycle and try to convince students to apply to Harvard you normally wouldn't consider the school is not whether they would normally considered school it's whether or not the school would consider\nThem and I mean I grew greed there's a historical mark problem during if you look at the performance on standardized testing ended break it down by racial demographics rehab issues that we need to attack and America right\nBut the reality is everyone is just as smart as everyone else in many Asian students are for our our first generation or second generation immigrants\nAnd they faced many of the same problems\nSo why are we discriminating against them we shouldn't be discriminated against anyone instead what we should be doing instead of lying to federal court about whether or not it's discriminatory when an obviously is\nWe should look it's it's the foundation ... look at the ferment dig it up figure out what's going wrong both in the homes of the schools are people that allow this marked under performance\nBecause there's no difference in the science of you and your racist can argue there was no intellectual difference defined by skin color\nPeriod it's not that Asian kids are better at math right it's a lot of them are on family structure where they're required to do their homework and that she'd been as prioritized over fun unhappy\nA lot of the way I raised my children was defined by how I knew Asian American parents to raise their children\nAnd guess what my kids went through a league schools and scored markedly higher than the Thirteen a B that they wouldn't if I had to [noise] um 'cause my kids are geniuses um you know my wife told me recently that apparently eighty percent of the intellect comes from the mother\nSo my genius must have been really really do to say and we all have to charge to outweigh the negatives that food from getting I'll have to apologize that she won't listen so it doesn't matter [noise] um we also [noise]\nSpeaking of discrimination how much time we got left in this segment Chris oh let's let's hear this segment let's talk about some more of a different type of discrimination\nGo ahead the segment you are slipping
