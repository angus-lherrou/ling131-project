Catholic mom is very Italian mom lived in Italy mom spoke Italian moms speaks Italian she doesn't you know and then stop or anything I grew up in a household with a very Anglo ... father Ken Webster I'm Ken Webster junior it's not a coincidence but\nMy dad has the same name as me what might be weird if it was of course not and I mean that would be stupid but now and my mother a Donna and got a very Italian spend a lot of time in Italy grew up in Italy my grandpa got my mom\nTo marry my dad my dad was a substitute teacher at a school where my my grandpa was a principal mom my dad was going to business school and my ... my grandpa convinced my mother and not to marry this guy in Italy but\nInstead to marry my father it didn't happen overnight though she fought\nKicking and screaming on that one but it did eventually happened eventually my mother fell in love with my dad ah the good old days arranged marriages on anyway so so today is an important day for Catholics today's Columbus Day technically Columbus stays on the twelfth but today's the day that we honor it so now my Catholic American homes out they're\nHappier Columbus Day and happy Columbus Day to the rest of you as well despite everything the leftist told you Christopher Columbus really truly is a notable folk hero for minorities in America no it's true he is a hero to minorities in America all explain why in fact he was one of America's first ethnic folk heroes\nHe was used as a symbol for patriotism and pride\nBack with Catholics were fighting against the Ku Klux Klan at the turn of the twentieth century\nBut American Democrats don't seem\nTo remember or care let's talk about that for just a minute shall we\nUnlike Halloween and made a an International Women's day\nUm and and ride on the streets day Columbus Day is a rather unpopular holiday in twenty eight teams the Democrats don't want it\nThe way they love May Day and International Women's day who doesn't want him tampon appreciation day I mean who doesn't love that you know how the left is like if this is like act ethically unpopular though this is a holiday they really hate Columbus Day in twenty Eighteen\nIs about as unpopular as barbecue sauce on textbooks Texas brisket those of you and I bought the joke but it shows you that live outside of Texas if you don't get that joke\nUm maybe you are listening on line in Chicago right now it's as unpopular as catch up on a Chicago hotdog you don't do it it's what you just don't do it\nUnless you probably know the story of Earth Day Earth Day was created by who I rhino horn why is the famous murdered his lottery shoved or in a a\nHe shoved her in a a a a box and kept her there for weeks Earth Day was created by the unicorn killer I discussed in person a leftist activist who made a name for himself on a national level and then shoved his girlfriend's decomposing corps and the Trump\nSo that's all right\nWell now the politically incorrect social justice warriors of America wanted will limited Columbus Day and replace it with something called indigenous people day it's worth pointing out that one of the founders of this movement was just as morally reprehensible as I rhino horn the first major political leader in America\nTo sign legislation transforming Columbus Day into indigenous people day\nWas former Seattle mayor ed Murray now who remembers why he's famous\nIt was one year ago it was a relatively short time ago folks it happened at twenty fourteen um other mayors of smaller cities have passed similar laws in previous years Berkeley Santa Cruz in the nineties Minneapolis a couple of weeks after Seattle but no city as well populated\nAs the home of the Space Needle or politician as influential as ed Murray had got on board at the time with the indigenous people's day movement alright\nToday while most Americans honor Christopher Columbus Seattle residents will follow in the footsteps of their former political leader by honoring indigenous persons and spitting on the grave of Columbus ironically Columbus was an indigenous person for mentally but for some reason left is just repaired or indigenous people as\nPeople with dark skin I guess if you have lightly pigment its skin and can't be indigenous but it's a bunch of malarkey of course you can be of ... and of course they are they absolutely are anyway\nSo ed Murray very likely won't be celebrating with his fellow Seattle residents he's still dealing with the aftermath of his twenty Seventeen political scandal in which it was revealed that he may or may not have raped as many as five underage boys\nDied yeah yeah we all forgot about that yeah one of the guys who helped launch indigenous people day is actually a guy who\nMay or may not have been a child molester he's currently involved in some lawsuits regarding that\nAh but on the subject to the indigenous people day well what the heck is it what is why do we call it that\nAre just so we're clear technically everyone is an indigenous person from somewhere\nThe definition of indigenous means originating or occurring naturally in a particular place\nBeing a native ... that definition of that word is just make enough but it basically applies to everyone on earth everyone's in a digital person from somewhere so why would you celebrate it did you just people day that's silly well because the leftist silly\nThe left wants to stay Christopher Columbus\nTheir opinions have him ... unfortunately for them or about his distorted as a as the lessons that we once learned in the twentieth century public schools it is true that some of the things that we learned about Christopher Columbus has kids weren't exactly accurate but the thing is that they're telling us today aren't exactly accurate either\nToday liberals will tell you Colombo which is his real name Columbus his real name was Colombo that he killed and raped American Indians but that statement is not entirely accurate\nThe truth is he originally trying to convince the queen of England to make peace with the people in the new world\nHe wanted to form a colony for Spain to trade with the people of India whose which is so we thought was here he thought he was in India we all know that part of the story and simple math facts matter it's relevant to point out that the indigenous people he was trying to trade with weren't even technically Native Americans\nIsn't that interesting they they were actually living in the Dominican Republic or Haiti or the Bahamas\nThe very fact that we don't exactly know where he landed says a lot about how much we really know about the alleged crimes that he was later accused\nOf committing Columbus actually made for unique trips to the region each trip was totally different from the previous one his first trip was very peaceful\nThen when he returned for the second trip he discovered that the many left behind had been murdered\nAt the time his order to defend the colony and seek revenge for king Ferdinand and queen Isabella was something that that must must not be objected to\nHe didn't have much of a choice on this one Spain was funding his trip and the natives had killed his men and his men were the queen's men Greenspan\nHe made a third trip which included his brothers as passengers All right let's talk about that this is kind of where it gets controversial Christopher his brothers weren't as interested in diplomacy in ... navigational technology is he was they were fighters not explores violence erupted\nAccusations were made about Columbus and he was ...\nUsually says that museums exist so that people can say that went to museums\nI Know I get yelled at for this but many museums are only slightly more it's just to me than for aids I Know I mean even I mean he even throw things at me I get it um so and put that aside from germs around\nIts would all be a same kind of suggestions I'd give you my favorite Mexican indeed a Mexican restaurant\nIs a ...\nA ... area because
