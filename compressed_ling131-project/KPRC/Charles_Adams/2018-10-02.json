Republicans like him desirous civility is a fine thing but it cannot replace ones desire for liberty America is only America because America is about freedom freedom from government interference in our lives\nThe entire purpose of the modern Democratic Party used to destroy that freedom and expand government they must\nBe defeated\nThere is no reasoning with people whose only goal was your complete submission\nA decade ago I was running for Congress in Arizona's ... district I was young hot headed and completely unknown I had never run for office or been politically involved before but I saw what Brock Obama was doing to this country and wanted to do something to stop it\n\nSo I threw myself into it every free moment I had was since crisscrossing my district giving speeches shaking hands and kissing babies but running for office is nearly impossible if you don't have any campaign money and it's difficult to talk people into giving you campaign money when you're completely unknown and have no legitimacy\nBut one of my best ways to get the legitimacy is endorsements\nOne of the best way to get it as me and the grand scheme of things they don't really mean that much but for a young unknown candidate there everything so I began asking every Republican committee men state senator or congressman and US Senator that I could get a meeting with\nMy campaign manager and I flew to Washington DC and started asking everyone we could further endorsement\nMost of them flatly said no and we didn't blame him for it there's absolutely no advantage for congressmen do indoors and unknown candidate\nWe did get a few of 'em and say yes though one of them was ripped representative Trent Franks Trenton helped me get meetings with others in the Arizona delegation including flake\nWe walked into flakes office that meeting time an exchange of few pleasant trees and then I asked for his endorsement\nHe didn't say yes he didn't say no he didn't ask my ... positions on taxes abortion immigration or anything else they didn't ask you about my religious beliefs are my family life\nHe didn't laugh in my face and tell me to get out of his office all those things would have been perfectly acceptable and understandable instead however he said something I'll never forget and to this day makes my stomach turn he looked me right in the eye and said\nWhat did John McCain say\nThat is who Jeff Flake is\nThat's who he was and it too will always be he is wholly rely on on stronger man to make his decisions for him McCain was once that man for him it didn't even occur to him to say yes or no one asked for an endorsement\nNow he's turned to the Democrats you know they can use flight to further their goal of stopping Kavanaugh the same way they use them to try and pass the gang of eight amnesty bill\nFlake is a Fifteen year old boy who shoplift first street gang because they were nice to win\n\nTrue peace can only be found on the other side of war\nFlake simply lacks the necessary equipment to fight the political battles we need the modern left is weaponized they're not interested in your piece gestures the left is only interested in dominating ... men lifelike had their place but that place no longer exists in modern America\nSo he has made for a world of bubble gum and you'd accords and campfire giggling with Democrats that world is gone and his efforts to live on the finished\n... capping conservative causes and judges\nThis X. two weeks later gave the Democrats will be used a rip apart Kavanaugh his wife and his daughters whether he

all that but you know who that lady is the lady who swayed Jeff lakes opinion and gave the Democrats another week to pound Kavanaugh that lady's name is Anna Maria or she ...\nShe's a member of the working families party and the executive director of the New York based and George Soros funded Center for popular democracy\nStuffed some\nInnocent little snowflakes that stumbled into Jeff Flake in
