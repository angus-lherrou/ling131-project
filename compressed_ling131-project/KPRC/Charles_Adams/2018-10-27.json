if God Forbid\nRemember this coming to us from official team bucket Gmail dot com or what if God Forbid there was another attack like nine eleven would we do the whole Iraq invasion thing again to another country trying to hunt the perpetrators in their home country or not walk but basically what would be our response in this day and age I'm curious because the whole side of situation\nSo let me know um if there was another nine eleven\nWould we hunt them in their home country uh yes and the answer is yes Kyle\nIn fact I think if there was another nine eleven we would probably take a more World War two version of what our response would be which is a mass destruction of any area that we think plays a was giving safe haven to them\nUm I think the American people's rafts if there were another day when we lost three thousand people in one terrorist attack\nWould be a fearsome and biblical thing\nThat's my that's my sense of it but you know it would depend on a lot of factors Andrew
