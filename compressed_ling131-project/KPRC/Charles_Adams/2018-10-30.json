times\nImmediately after a massacre that has nothing to do with them yeah Chris said politicizing before the bodies were even cold and that is true\nIn fact I saw somebody or one of the Democratic consultant was doing it while the shooting was happening as soon as the reports of shot fired shots fired and this is what we get now from our media this is a direct quote was sort of this you can draw a direct\nLine from all the vitriol when Kate rhetoric about the Caribbean that some two thousand miles away from our border and the gunman in Pittsburgh who referenced at in somehow turned it into an attack on the Jews that was from CNN anchor Allison camera Rhoda\nJust said that Monday twenty four hours afterwards all of a sudden it's Trump's fault they all would that by the way that's

who mode a woman down in Charlottesville were never even looking for Trump's explicit blessing because they knew the president had allowed big it's like them to go about\nTheir business she added his role is just to set the tool set the tone their role is to do the best\nIt gets worse\nMSNBC analyst Joe Scarborough criticized Trump or holding a campaign rally in Illinois on Saturday the same\nDay that the shooting took place and said that showed quote Trump doesn't care about the shooting as much as he claims that was done intentionally to send a message to white nationalist that this doesn't bother me that much\n\nIn Lenox Adam Serwer insisted the appearance spark for the shooting was the caravan story inflamed by us presidents seeking to help his party when a mid term a lecture election no political gesture no public statement than do alteration in rhetoric or behavior\nWill change this fact that I could go on the New York times of course had something horrific to say\n\nThey they basically said there's no way to separate Trump from this and on and on and on we go in dishes are permanent future now\nYeah I hate it and it sucks it does it sucks it's terrible I hate that but that is are a lot in life now we are kind of constantly have to hear that\nAnd it's brought to Obama's fault that it's sterile but it is yeah it's my uh that's my story we're about to play a little comedy

really enjoyed it\nOf people thought it was kind of intense and violent at the time if you go back in and check it out you'll you'll see what I mean but it was a good movie I really enjoyed it and it's a really creative concept who would think that turtles in a nuclear\nWaste named after renaissance painters who have ninja skills would\nBe a hate well it was there you have it Gary\nHey book greetings from team buck Hungary I took her advice and started watching the first season of picky blinders\n'em and last night it was awesome I'm hook thanks for the recommendation I'm all for the next week and that is what I'd be doing in the evenings ... brother keep it up shields Hi Gary Gary she'll Patty I'm so glad you liked the blinders on I really I really do enjoy it I I think it's a very entertaining very well done very entertaining show a little bleak\nFor sure but it's ah it's well executed\nThe writing is good and and there's some very interesting twists and turns in it\nI I started watching the third season of daredevil all over the weekend which I Would have to say you know the thing about daredevil is that it it's also a little bit dark a little bleak I think it's well executed for what it is I just can't understand\nHow they made daredevil such a compelling show at Netflix\nAnd they made iron fist which was just on washable garbage man iron fish was crash it's also a superhero story also set in New York same you know platform with Netflix you'd think they'd have some idea how to do it the iron fist got cancelled and thank heavens 'cause it was such\nA piece of of waste\nAnd ah anyway but yeah I have to say I think that daredevil three so far as the little slow and getting going but so far it's ... it's pretty well done I find the acting all very good I I enjoy the performances even if you're not in that industry brio stuff\nI think you might like daredevil I I think you might find daredevil to be a pretty good show a\nCarla\n... wash U and ... the other day with a B loved her comment about someone writing his comments about the bomber on teleprompter like no one ever did that before love the show so all the pick of you and your parents in D.C looks like your dad has the same swoop Carla thank you for that kind of comments about my\nParents I'm Bret Baer I I think that I was able to say exactly what I really wanted to you on the circumstances which is always which I think is a very important for whenever you get one of those performances whenever you're doing that I also went on ... show on friday as you guys know\nSo that was another chance for me to say what was really on my mind uh and uh after my dad yeah my dad has great hair it's true great hair he's got he's got a silver swoop now in fact I could probably be his call signs silver ...\nBut it was so good to see my parents um I've got the best parents in the world so that's\nA big advantage that I've had in life you know I Know you've probably got great parents

you but I you know I think you engage where you can and that's it you know you you do where do you think it's a bad idea\nIt's not worth it sometimes Jennifer right table yesterday I attended a lecture presentation by Arthur Sulzberger\nGerman up in New York Times called the impact of media and truth on democracy I went with an open mind is I always try to approach things in life this way

how we live in dangerous times journalist or unsafe et cetera et cetera I lost track of how many times to use the words danger or dangerous\nHowever you definitely capitalist he bragged about New York times successfully mounted monetize their online media\nAnd when asked a question from the audience about how the New York times could be more accessible middle class Sulzberger said\nThe cost of ...
