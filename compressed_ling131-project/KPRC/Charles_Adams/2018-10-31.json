at work today Chris\nWe need to talk to management get you some time off nobody can be that slow so isn't that creepy\nBut of course that's not the kind of thing that ... would look to listen to he'd rather learn to did you know and he actually tells me this as if I'm interested so many people were named William there's so many people were named John that it actually got confusing when it came to bank records so that's why they had to create certain names because they'd already loan to William\n[noise] or Marty Marty ... it's brutal brutal\nAnyway onto the next bit of sunny news Whitey Bolger it's dead\nWhat do you why you were going to be like that for do you know who Whitey Bolger is Chris what's wrong with you what ... what what do they teach in school today\nAre ... let me go through the timeline of his life for the other one person in the audience like Chris who does not know who Whitey Bolger was they made a movie about um I think it was called Black Friday or black Sunday he yeah he was a gangster from\nBoston\nHis brother was like state senator and that that made the ... a timeline high points here born in Nineteen twenty nine Irish immigrant lives in Boston I'm sure you had a horrible accent like everyone else that lives in Boston Boston\nAnd fifty six goes to prison for bank robbery like most prisons that's where he says he learned how to really become a criminal\nI've seen a million documentaries and things like that on Whitey Bolger like that's where he learned his craft was in prison\nGets released from prison in ah sixty five by this time he's younger brother William I believe his name was was elected to the state house of representatives\nSo follows me on this young Whitey was obviously not his real name is your name was James\nGangster criminal the brother\nStayed house of representatives in Boston states like that like the state house state Senate it's not all like it is in Texas are state legislatures important here they do a good job but in some states those guys are like God's I mean those guys rule the world\nTo be a state representative in Massachusetts is a big deal you're swinging a big hammer became\n\nSixty five released from prison Nineteen Seventy is brother moves from the state house to the state Senate Nineteen Seventy five by this\nPoint in time Bolger is heavily involved in organized crime and you have to understand how it worked in Boston back in the day that the Italian Mafia rules all in America\nTo this day they rule all as far as the underworld goes goes as far as organized crime goes a million other upstarts of come and gone there's a Russian Mob presence there is an Irish Mob presents there's this there's that but nobody uses in trenches Ian Talley in mafia\nIn Boston there was no different at this time and they're all fighting over control\nWell so happens Bolger\nDecides that his John friend his his his childhood friends name was John Connelly\nWorks for the FBI he's an FBI agent\nBolger who is currently with an Irish Mob group he's trying to run the Italian mob group out of Boston these trying for more control decides he's going to start forming on the Italian mob to John Connelly with the FBI are hot\nSo this is quite a scam bull just got going keeping my now his one of his brothers is a state senator\nA childhood friend of his Connelly it's an FBI agent\nThose are some nice hook ups to have if you're a up and coming crook and you're trying to run your competition out of town\nIn fact at some point in time I Believe it's a hang on let me look Seventy eight yeah Seventy eight is rather became president of the state Senate so now you have the president of the state Senate and an FBI agent in your back pocket guy swings a big stick\nWell Bolger does what gangsters to Bolger\nStarts killing people killing\nHis competition killing people he quote unquote finds out are informing on him you can use your imagination as to how he may have found out people were informing on him and eventually he gets caught\nConnelly gets caught I Believe if memory serves me Connelly went to prison I'm doing a lot of this off memory Connelly went to prison the FBI agent as he should\nThe seven eleven making nachos thirty seconds later you know it didn't change his face\nBolger goes on the run and I think we have to check your I think Bolger was on the run for sixteen years if memory memory serves me yup Bolger was on the FBI's most wanted list for sixteen years until these two thousand eleven over arrest\nSo this guy bales and ... for ...\nI Believe again I'm going off of member here but I'm almost positive one of his neighbors in an apartment complex and California finally recognized him from all the FBI's most wanted posters\nAnd they're like hey this is the famous gangster and a lot of you who've seen the movie departed with Jack Nicholson jak ... Chris please tell me you've seen the departed with Jack Nicholson oh you frustrate me shuttle launch I don't understand\nArt everybody that Cruz is seen the movie departed was ... Jack Nicholson Jack Nicholson's character was based on Whitey Bolger Johnny\nFor a refugee camps in that way although these days people are coming up with all kinds of creative creative possible solution to the situation at the southern border uh I think that one would probably go too far even for Trump though that's my sense\nA thank you so much reading in my front made dean rides I but I Know I Know he was kidding I Know he was kidding I just I didn't want to step on them and thought process seas so I moved\nTo the next roll call Maria\nRight does it make you wonder where all the anti gun folks are after the synagogue shooting they usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative woman Maria they are already out\nSpinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have whereas a in full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough to know that right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where gun rights are very much a supported by folks who vote\nAnd so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think your honestly not seeing more shrill uh anti gun commentary in the media and while you're not seeing more people running around protesting\nAnd all that kinda stuff ... right I'm a proud member of team buck Israel thanks for unwavering support for Jewish people everywhere filling the low ...\nSo I'm Glad you're feeling it thank you very much for writing in from teen book Israel and please spread the word to your Israeli brothers and sisters that we would love to have more and more of them listening on the podcast\nJoining in on the freedom which ah aries my buddy ... bought this weekend the leftist media including fake tapper\nHave proven their either agenda driven subversive spend on tearing the country apart for her own purposes or completely stupid and insane\nThere's no simple misunderstanding or a difference of opinion on this point\nBy calling Trump's nationalistic rhetoric anti Semitic they're literally feeding into and agreeing with the talking points of anti Semitic groups like the Nazis the nation of Islam and ... who say Jews cannot be loyal to their country et cetera et cetera uh yeah the media has been a horrific all in this area\nAnd a tap or has\nEmbarrassed himself insofar as he spent so much time reading this oh I'm such a serious newsman brand I have no bias or a legion he's a nasty snide little fellow\nAnd does a lot of stuff in public that is meant for public consumption but I can tell you that a behind the scenes not a nice guy not a good guy and that's all you really need to know\nUh and it's made a joke of his whole show I mean he had somebody on saying that ISIS has not radicalize as many people as Trump and let it go didn't immediately say well well you can't say that on here so that's all you really need to know about some of these folks John\n... book I've been following all be quote justified violence from the left\nI Know how to beat it ah the\nAnti ... and be alum folks are just paid thugs they don't really want to fight they just won't Republicans to fight back to defend themselves so the left can point the finger at the right and say see they're they're violent fascist they're willing to be bloody didn't beaten up for it\nThe real way to beat this has to follow the money why can't people with the right skills that infiltrate these groups at a high level and expose the leaders and expose the money uh John falling the money is very important that's why we had our friend\nRocky cut some on yesterday to talk about\nWho is trying to fund these are the\nFun the caravan organized the caravan there are definitely people work and I think they are definitely people that are putting money into this just a question of finding out who they are so I got to find the money and we're certainly looking into it willy\nRight seems like everybody forgot how the media were searching for a Tea Party member called James Holmes after the Colorado shooting yes really I remember that there have been efforts to try and tie the Tea Party to violence and they were unsuccessful because the Tea Party was a remarkably\nNot just non violent but peaceful and entirely law abiding movement and I think that that doesn't get talked about enough for obvious reasons media doesn't want to discuss\nHow well behaved and how civic or how much did it responsibility there was in the Tea Party movement I'm Suzanne right you're so right on the DSD I've got the real thing and I'll trade might be GST in for election laws trauma any day\nBecause it is not really a but not really because we did use your mind protecting yourself as a coping skills Susan\nI'm yes Jews and the fact that liberals are running around saying they think they have the DSD because Trump won the election tells you a lot about the fact that they do need a safe spaces\nInvolved in these rights ... vote ... as\nA part of a ...\nUh I Do not speak Espanol bubble needs to do so I have no idea I assume it means something to converse\nVote Jay ... is this where he we converse I guess the answer's yes but I Do not speak Espanol so pleased right back uh and on and go in English or racing glass on it I mean I say that uh let's see\nJoanne rights would you address the issue of unvaccinated individuals' come to the U. S. entering school systems all over the country\nWell Joanne this is a concern a real one but people get very tense about it because whenever you talk about migrants and disease they say that that's inherently racist you're saying migrants are dirty and unclean and all this that's not what anyone should say or or is saying who's reasonable on this issue\nBut there are concerns about vaccination a lack of vaccination of some of these Margaret populations\nAnd there have been diseases that have been propping up popping up across the country that were thought to have been eradicated not\nIn large numbers but it is something to think about and they don't want to have this discussion and the people that want to get the CDC more involved want the facts out there and there are a lot of immigration activists on the left who don't care\nAnd think that this is either a lie which it is not there are people who are going to be having different levels of vaccination that that come into the country as part of these caravans\nOf and also just want to shut the whole thing down even if it is in July because I think it's more important to we're clauses open borders Archie\nAnd that's the show today please please spread the word tell somebody listen to the ... show\nYou can always listen on the on apple broadcast on the ... heart podcasting platform and\nThe more that subscribe to better please also writes them reviews for the show just give me the the star rating if you can on apple pie cash and say something about the show that you\nThink makes it a special place see tomorrow shields I [noise]\nGot to keep your online activity you're browsing and all of that stuff [noise] pride you don't want to getting out there for marketers for scammers for fraudsters and if you're engaging with your tablet iPhones are computer guess what your information can be tracked and can be used if you want to avoid all that\nYou want to take back your privacy use express\nVps [noise] I Know what it's like I Am from CIA and the NYPD and telling division and we have all kinds of security training\nYou want somebody to make sure that your information is protection expressed VPN has asked that wants to see in the background and make sure that your information does not get used and abused take back your privacy folks protect your online activity and find out how you can get\nThree months free with express VPN dot com slash bar that express VPN dot com slash book for three months free with a one year package express VPN dot com slash bar [noise]\n\n\nHey it's Matt Thomas for top tax defenders these are the local guys that have been helping our listeners what their Irish Troubles for years we recommend them because you'd need professional help with the\nTargeting birthright citizenship uncommon Robert Fox news a fire storms brewing over whether the president can do away with birthright citizenship\nYou are a hundred percent director using false a I'm a principles here uh and and false a story decisis to pretend like they did rule on this but they in fact in America sheriff dot com America shark dot com share of got about a minute left me a prediction about next Tuesday what's gonna happen is there is still on of energy and still enough\nYou know women vinegar on our side to pull this through\nYeah ... not too long ago I think the X factor in next Tuesday's going to be the blue collar male\nIs the one that's not captured by any old suburban women they're going to be out there on ... involved and all that sort of thing if there is a huge blue collar mail turn out that's what happened in ... old didn't capture right I think we'll be okay but it's all about turnout\n... and ... to me the Kavanaugh effect still exists although not as ... as it was about a month ago I think that's still going to get people to the polls because they saw truly be unmasked Democrat Party didn't but\nWell there's one demographic that was watching a both and I think more than any other and said blue collar mail as solve that uh marrying are over ...
