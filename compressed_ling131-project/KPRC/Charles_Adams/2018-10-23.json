take that on board as something that might sway me to one side of the argument the other I can just tell you a jot I've never come across that and I've asked a lot of people about this at all I get or people to get mad at me and then they send me a link to a blog\nThat has nothing other than just somebody posting other blog link articles and that's it so I I asked him when it when I talk about the
