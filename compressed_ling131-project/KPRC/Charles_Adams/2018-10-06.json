location that coach was just directing traffic here in the ... we were on a holiday that we're just we're we're on right now [laughter] and and this is a that this is Texas do you wait\nSo it's a special week but it is it that I've heard coaches say this coach brown an art site as well that\nThis game is made more special\nIf you're going into it on a roll and your team is going into this on a roll\nYeah and and you know we feel good about the way that we played the last few weeks um you know obviously coming out of Manhattan, Kansas with a win for the first time in sixteen years uh against um\nArguably the most respected coach in college football uh you know our guys have a lot of confidence that the one thing that also\nHelps is you know we're we're battle tested you know we we played these first you know after the Tulsa game\nThose three games against us see TCU and then on the road at Kansas State um those were those were not easy ... nor were they going to be but our guys found ways to with them and um yeah it is nice to go into the game with a little bit of confidence\nThat Oscar jobs just said something in in in what you just said a jog my memory of thinking about this because a lot of the national conversation as this week is that that has been going on this week is\nHow to Texas get here after the Maryland game and there's so much fixation and what happened\nIn that season opener in and you even said it a week ago you know what happened against TCU what happened to get us see even what happened against Maryland has no bearing on what's going to happen with Kansas State and I guess you would say what happened to get Kansas State doesn't have bearing on going into this match with Oklahoma\nBut also it after practice she has yesterday and this was referring to ask her just said you talked about getting just doing things a little bit better a little bit harder every not radical change just just getting a little bit better\nYeah I I think well to the the first part you know you you you learn you develop over the course of the season and um you know we we didn't play our best\nAgainst Maryland and but you know there there was a sense that that the the the right attitude was there the right mindset again we have a dog that nausea Mm about you know pressing early in that game and then dig in ourselves a\nWhole we just couldn't quite get out of and then the the rain delay you know kind of letting them get fresh again anyways but we we learned a lot about ourselves we learned a lot about what it takes to win we learned a lot about the psychology of us and and how we need to approach game day uh each and every week but I think\nThe biggest thing about this week is like you said it was um\n[noise] we recognize the importance of this and this is not just another game when we get that this you don't want to minimize that I don't want to minimize that the important that this game has a on our state or university or fans all of the above we we get that important but\nUh when you've won four straight games you wanted against the people that you want it and where you want to the\nThe players would look at me like I was crazy if I walked into that team meeting on Sunday and said hey nice when guys for in a row uh but by the way this is a big game against our rival so we're going to do things completely different all week and the way that we prepare that\nThat's not the right way we recognize the importance we recognize the passionate intensity that this game brings out in and not just our team but in in our fans as well but we also understand that what got us here was how we prepare\nSunday through friday so that we can be confident in that preparation and and cut loose on Saturdays\nHave you seen that on the practice field this week that they that they've taken your words about doing\nA little stronger a little harder a little a little more intense\nBut not again not trapped in a radically trying to do

my personal politics from uh from that particular thing and and honestly what I think has happened or is happening right now\nOr is that we're beginning to ask a lot of difficult questions and the opposition's typical sponsors aren't working um you know we're asking questions about fundamental governance you know we're we're asking people why the status quo has to be the status quo\nUncomfortable questions about the construction of the union and whether or not the federal government is really serving the people with taxes and so I can imagine for a lot of the folks out there in the what I Would call the permanent political class a that's those are uncomfortable questions to be asking\nYou know when we ran I Would agree that the D.C aristocracy is self perpetuating they're not interested in anything new and I think both the Democrats and Republicans has two sides of the same coin but what if you could nutshell why you think Texas should leave the United states what does that nutshell if you could do it in two three sentences\nWell it's it's quite simple you know going around and distilling down with everyone has to say about it here in Texas why they supported it boils down to\nTexans are sick and tired of being governed by a hundred and eighty thousand pages of federal laws rules and regulations administered by water for be separate agency and two and a half million unelected bureaucrats at the end of the day Texans believe that the best people to govern taxes are Texans\nAre you know I could actually tell me do you sell them Charles Alexander rapidly on a board of right do you think we I Know we have a a robust in vibrant and very diverse economy but do you think that we can make it without financial support from the union\nYeah the the one thing people need to understand when they talk about federal money flowing back in the taxes is that every dollar flows back into Texas came out of the pockets of Texas taxpayer first\nUh on average Texans pay overpay end of the union somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred and three two hundred and sixty billion dollars a year\nAh that's that you know the amount of money that we lose as part of being part of the federal union is the equivalent of a Hurricane Harvey type of hitting Texas every nine much\nSo that's how much money is sucked out of our pockets to Washington DC be redistributed to other states were to feed the federal bureaucracy\nOkay so I I get now\nThe foundational disarmament of your position now you wrote you've written several books\nRight\nI've actually written to uh I I tell people I'm not an author item on this looking to get Texas independence and then move on with my life\nWas your last book your most recent book um Amazon yanked it and why why do you think that's Texas right that was the book that was yanked\nRight right it was the end it's actually ... way more complex than getting it yeah I mean that was eventually what happened but um it it all initially started with Amazon after the book you know it's one hundred percent five star ratings I mean it's done very good and the sales rankings Brett\nAh they started making some moves that a centrally were were met to\nThe book from getting in the hands of people I mean that was the effect and\nIt wasn't one of those movies that are in\nWell the first thing they did actually three things like this simultaneously that really kick this off the first thing they did was they restricted book sales to prime members on like\nThe second thing that I heard was that well\nThis one yeah that was weird I mean the the distributor who actually has thousands of titles placed with Amazon says that they had never seen that before but it was really the next two moves that Florida which was they they capped\nThe number of copies per customer to for not for sale or per customer and then they dropped the price of the book down below wholesale while I thought okay well that's perfectly fine I I don't understand the book business right that's cool of people can get a cheaper but after about five weeks of wrangling with\nAmazon the distributor came back to this is obviously political and the reason this is ... we can say it's politically as when if Amazon drops that price down because they are essentially the bell Cal ... all of the retailers looked to Amazon set their price okay what they're trying to do was make the book\nSo unprofitable that other retail outlets wouldn't even bother to place additional wholesale orders because they couldn't make any money off\nSo why do what do you think motivated him I mean it's not a complex there you just want to secede from the union [noise] what do you think angered who whatever you know beyond executive at Amazon the made the decision well how did you catch their intention\nYeah that's that's a great question and it's something that that we can't figure out look I've I've wrestled with is the publisher has the distributor has a you know we saw the answers from Amazon and Amazon's just Spike Lee not forthcoming they told about\nThree or four different stories along the way of actually they just remove the the book for stock uh I mean they basically said we're not going to stock it anymore so we had to put some public pressure\nOn them and then they made it available again but then they decided to slow ship\nOr they basically said if you choose to day shipping you'll get the book and two to four weeks that finally changed actually as a as of this morning so you're actually the first person to to hear about this but they\nThey've changed that so you know every time they make one of these moves we have to we have to go out there and bang the drum on this issue and then finally eventually they were left\nWellness issue with you I mean the Amazon is a ...", "show_name": "Charles Adams", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "06"}
