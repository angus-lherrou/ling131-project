I did I did an interview watch with Alan combs and he was a he was less than friendly so\n[laughter] so so why the animosity towards it towards your ... your personal politics are towards your your movement to see the state from the union\nWell you know I've been I've been pursuing a the idea of Texas independence for twenty two years now and and so it's difficult to really divorce my my politics my personal politics\nFrom uh from that particular thing and and honestly what I think ... has happened or is happening right now\nOr is that we're beginning to ask a lot of difficult questions and the opposition's typical sponsors aren't working um you know we're asking questions about fundamental governance you know we're we're asking people why the status quo has to be the status quo\nUncomfortable questions about the construction of the union and whether or not the federal government is really serving the people with taxes and so I can imagine for a a lot of the folks out there in the what I Would call the permanent political class a that's those are uncomfortable questions to be asking\nYou know ... I Would agree that the D.C aristocracy is self perpetuating they're not interested in anything new and I think both the Democrats and Republicans just two sides of the same coin but what if you could nutshell why you think Texas should leave the United states what is that nutshell if you could do it in two three sentences\nWell it's it's quite simple you know going around and distilling down with everyone has to say about it here in Texas why they supported it boils down to\nTexans are sick and tired of being governed by a hundred and eighty thousand pages of federal laws rules and regulations that are made under water for ... separate agency and two and a half million unelected bureaucrats at the end of the day Texans believe that the best people to govern taxes are Texans\nAre you know I could actually tell me do you sell them in Charles Adam sander rapidly on a board of right do you think we know we have a a robust and vibrant and very diverse economy but do you think that we can make it without financial support from the union\nYeah the the one thing people need to understand when they talk about federal money flowing back in the facts is is that every dollar flows back into taxes came out of the pockets of Texas taxpayer first uh on average Texans pay\nOverpay end of the union somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred and three hundred and sixty billion dollars a year\nAh that's that you know the amount of money that we lose as part of being part of the federal union is the equivalent of a Hurricane Harvey ... hitting Texas every nine much so that's how much money is sucked out of our pockets to Washington DC be redistributed to other states were to feed the federal bureaucracy\nOkay so I I get now the foundational the for a moment of your position\nNow you wrote you've written several books right\nI've actually written to tell people I'm not an author Adam I'm just looking to get taxes independence and then move on with my life\nWas your last book your most recent book um Amazon yanked it and why why do you think that's tax it right that was the book that was yanked\nRight right it was the end it's actually ... way more complex than getting ... I mean that was eventually what happened but um it all initially started with Amazon after the book you know it's\nOne hundred percent five star ratings I mean it's done very good and the sales rankings Brett ah they started making some moves that are essentially\nWere were meant to prevent the book from getting in the hands of people I mean that was the effect and\nIt wasn't one of those movies that are in\nWell the first thing they did actually three things like this simultaneously that really kick this off the first thing they did was they restricted book sales to prime members on like\nThe second thing that I had heard was that well this\nOne yeah that was weird I mean the the distributor who actually have thousands of titles place with Amazon says that they had never seen it before\nBut it was really the next two moves that Florida which was they they capped the number of copies per customer to for not for sale or per customer\nAnd then they dropped the price of the book down below wholesale while I thought okay well that's perfectly fine I I don't understand the book business right that's cool uh people can get a cheaper but after about five weeks of wrangling with Amazon the distributor\nCame back to this is obviously political and the reason this is that we can say it's politically as when if Amazon drops that price down because they're essentially the bell\nCal ... all of the retailers looked at Amazon and set the price okay what they're trying to do was make the book so unprofitable that other retail outlets wouldn't even bother to place additional wholesale orders because they couldn't make any money off so\nReal rant element be with you\nAnd\n\nDot com [noise]\nHarry I appreciate the picture Newsmax when to give you a picture of Kerry introduced studio\n[noise] um I think it looks pretty good looks darned good [noise]\nAre you able to hear me or not hear me today or right now\nUh actually I Am that out of one side so it's not too\nBad well I'll tell you this you sound great and I'm not gonna keep on going to be as if it was just weird the way that it sounds weird but we'll get that worked out by next week but there is there's the picture of carry in the new studio now that that monitors a little bit bright but we'll get to a professional picture maybe by saying\nDone a suit enough but you look great in a studio at school and and uh we'll get all this the horn found were Terry cannot take part what you normally does very nice studio\nRight yeah that's a very very nice and they get all the kings are down it's going to be perfect\nAnd it's gonna be ... great picture appreciate your spending that over I won't show the people the first picture which was like mostly the monitors in your little head wasn't above a quarter of an event you better than what do you like what are you doing All right well we'll take some phone calls in a second there is also news here did you see this news on Murkowski if you can\nWell I tell people about this she's actually\nTweeted something that says which way she's voting Tamar did you see that\nI didn't but I'll go find it okay\nLet's make that happen and she's going to be making an announcement soon on the Senate floor if you live in Alaska I'm here to tell you for sure now\nYou need to vote that asks up okay there's going to put it right up there it is it eight nine for one pack Joe ... dot com keep in mind that I've got a great ... got these cameras at my house by blink security and I've had him for a while\nAnd this was before blink even approached us and said hey we want to get to do something on the show of the reason why I have it is because it's easy to set up\nTheir ... cameras that were great during the day or night and the lighting you to see what's going on around your house we've got some cameras shut up all in all the permanent places would have somebody come undergoing coming down the driveway committed the doors\nOr if they're trying to get into the garage or anything else I mean we know exactly what's going on because of this great system blink motion activated ...
