I'm Still kind of thinking it's not the biggest sports tragedy in Houston this week I talked a little bit yesterday\nAbout an actual sports tragedy about something we should all be screaming about and we're not about a physician Jim Dr Jennifer Wagner who was robbed of her silver medal at the world cycling championship\nShe lost to a male cyclist name Rachel McKinnon who was awarded the gold silver medal went to a Dutch cyclists\nThat's right I said males cyclist now she is transitioning some more research it appears that she still has the parts\nDr Wagner objected and then was quickly labeled a

conclusion whether we're going to allow people and and and let me be very clear\nI'm okay with people being transgender it's not my business I\nBelieve the McConnell fundamental concept of liberty and disagree with a lot of Republicans about letting\nPeople with different preferences in different ideas about love live their life right\nI disagree when we're allowing\nHim and may fighters who were

great intolerance in America today and what makes this a larger\n[noise]\n\nA larger wrong in the sporting world for Houston is it poor Dr Wagner has been labeled a transfer to a lot of the media doesn't touch the story because it doesn't fit the narrative 'cause people are going to come back and say no this is disgusting right this is not fair\nI mean any normal person right I mean the create

I. S. ten NBC News there in South Carolina\nCajun Navy known for their response here in Houston for Hurricane Harvey\nKnown for their response to hurricane Michael that was the third most intense Atlantic hurricane strongest on record\nFor maximum sustained wind speeds the Cajun Navy rush there\nBut this little feel good story is what caught my attention you know we've got a lot to talk about with the local\nHouston government's failure to appropriately responded to Hurricane Harvey even a year later\nWe got a lot of talk about a large ... global charities exploiting\nThese isn't as the fundraising not returning the money to the community but they exploited\n\nWe have to talk about this new desire for many Americans including\nConservatives here in Houston who think that when there was a tragedy like this that the ... the government should come in and socialize and provide welfare to bell people up who decided not to buy the insurance and handle their own business and I thought who better to talk about this when Brian trash or\nThe spokesman for the United Cajun Navy Brian are you here with us or\nI Am here thanks for having me on today no thank you so much for being on\nWhere you from where were you involved with this story out of South Carolina\n[noise] uh no not South Carolina we uh our group deployed to North Carolina and after a foreign and are they just about a week ago a kind of hand the baton off to the locals and redirected the assets down to uh right outside of Panama City Florida\nOkay okay and were you involved with the group that came here and did so much good here in Houston just over a year and a month ago here for Harvey\nSo at the time of the army I was not involved with the United States Navy but yeah these these guys were definitely some of the first two are organized and um and enroll out there to uh the Houston area you know the uh just kinda\nTaking care of our own is just kind of the south Louisiana ways you know but um everybody remembers Katrina a shitty Houston in particular but really the whole state of Texas just bent over backwards to do everything they could to help help us out and uh that that favor an essay Cajun always pay their debts does he eat\nNo matter what they were gonna they felt like\nThey felt like what Harvey hit that bill came in the mail it to absolutely had to pay so they they settled up and wrote\nAnd I'm a huge from actually went to high school in the heart of a Katie and a little town called ... Louisiana and then I went\nTo ... have been many times people that are good\nPeople what's a good community I went from Austin, Texas at Fifteen to ... it was a little bit jarring at first but then I found out that there was nothing funnier than cruising from Sacred Heart through the ... to the Dairy Queen drinking margarita with your friends\nI'm ... probably a little bit of ... that they were actually speaking English\nYeah yeah no no I'll tell you I've met a guy or member Donny quibble do and I pronounce the ... and everyone laughed at me\nAnd then I learned you know you gotta learn to even the the radio station was actually still in ... in in French until noon there and ... the late eighties\nBut our road view to get involved with these you know what I find so attractive about them as these are guys that are directly helping but giving money any contribution to them they're taking that money and they're directly helping people in the community that was hurt I haven't seen them in Houston we've seen\nHundreds of millions of dollars raised hundreds of millions billions of dollars in aid given to both Houston in Texas and I see people\nThat receive no benefit from it I ever see I see the the government using a bureaucracy to pick and choose who they want to help and I think the whole system is broken\nWhat are your thoughts on that like the red cross or the government classically socializing the response [noise] [noise]\nYeah so you know first of all the uh the Cajun Navy Medicaid you maybe I'm In an arcade you may be groups really ... I keep telling people at FEMA like these people can do what FEMA has always wanted to do but we'll never be able to do and that's immediate response search and rescue\nA logistics distribution of immediate needs like a water ice a ...\nI'm a medical supplies um things like that dream of just there's no way from mobilize at fast and\nYou know and it's not you know we love to to bash on the government but to be honest that the liability is different you know like with the with a private group like the Cajun Navy they they can they they can afford to ask for forgiveness rather than are missionaries for government screw something up is going to be held to pay but\nAs far as how I got involved you know back when Hurricane Harvey hit but actually out in California and uh I had been doing a lot of relationship building work\nFor the administration down in a Cuba and they brought they they asked me to come on the show and want American news talk about Cuba\nBut Hurricane Harvey was dominating the news and they knew that I I'd gone through Katrina personally so they asked me to be okay to switch topics to talk about hurricane\nAnd I said sure so we were you know talking about it with a lives wheeler\nOr their land and I'm a kind of you know she had to ask a question like what can people do to help and I just emit partly chat you know well don't give you money to the right cause because you know they they they don't want the money doesn't make its way to the victim said you need to look at you know organizations like the Cajun Navy was going out there and boots on the ground and saving lives as we speak is that in there\nYou know going out there on their own I'm leaving their own family and jobs go out there and and help their fellow man and\nThat some of them have put up like pay pal links what not to try to raise money\nThere is nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress built for everyone", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Charles Adams", "city": "Houston", "day": "19"}
