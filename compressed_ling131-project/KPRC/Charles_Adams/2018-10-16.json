going on\nWhere you live in a dream what's happening [noise] yeah\nI Want to make a couple of comments and then recently I listen to you every day by the way thanks you got a good show thank you and this on this Pocahontas thing um I don't know why people haven't done more research in the DNA but I have in my daughter has anyway short\nMake a kind of short you know there is no I meant to eighty percent of all the white people in America North America have Indian blah and look at even the diversity very few there are no\nI called Native American Indian all Indian came to America from Europe or from Asia so every almost every white person here has some ... uh Indian DNA and most\nIn North America has some type of black although very skilled and all that kind of stuff\nBut as far as somebody being a Cherokee you got a a DNA people they cannot differentiate between Cherokee and\nA mohawk so it's almost impossible to say what kind of you are or were\nAll or you might have some DNA way back when they came from Europe so\nYeah I Know we're talking about earlier time yet but he was a recent anthropology study that showed that Native Americans are here are American Indians here I have European blood many of them have an Asian blood they came over through the streets I mean it was a long migration they didn't just come out of the stones here on this land so even saying Native American is a misnomer so now you're absolutely right of what you're saying\nBut I'm just surprised that nobody really bringing his point out because when you research you're already in a you'll find out that maybe you are or Irish or you were part German Italian or something but\nIt seems crazy layer prey to that in fact she says she was one sixty four\n... between one sixty fourth in one one thousand twenty fourth\nYeah I did it take it from a current day and back it up and kind of reverse engineer it I mean that we're putting her at sixty Seventy a generation ago\nThat I I'm not I'm not buying it any way the only be big they sort of measured against South American Native Americans as the whole thing is very weird I think that today she prove that she's not very smart I think that's I think have you today what was proven here today was that a Senator Elizabeth Warren just not very smart\nAnd it's okay you want to be smart let me go back to the phone lines halo two um line one is going to be Emily in Tulsa Hi Emily what's going on\nUm I have the perfect man for her whenever I heard it this morning it hit me fake a Honda\nFake on us okay I Gotcha okay Carrie I think a lot of

else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me and the very beginning\nThat you are part of a revolution can make family family's\nJesse Kelly going on ... nine fifty\n[noise]\nSo we'd like to look at things through a historical perspective on the show\nAnd we do that because then you can really find out who won and lost you can take the emotion out of something\nAnd you can find out oh actually that didn't work out too bad in the end or ... that actually didn't work out at all in the end\nIt it gives clarity in Nineteen sixty four Republican ... convention hang with me or permit\nRonald Reagan gave this speech this now very famous speech called time for choosing supposed to be one of the most influential speeches of all time and it was it was great you can go back and listen to his great speech\nSo now we look back at that speech and what do we see because we have a historical perspective what do we see it launched his career and it did not long after that they asked him to run for governor of California ran got elected obviously we all know from there became a two term president great president\nHistorically we can see that was great it was a great moment great speech boy was wonderful you wouldn't know the reality of what people living through it saw Reagan got up\nAnd gave that speech at the convention not in support of himself he got up and gave it in support of Barry Goldwater who was running for president at the time against there'll be jak\nLyndon Johnson\nBarry Goldwater then went on to get slaughtered in that election one of the worst landslides in us presidential history\n[laughter] kidding he won six states out of fifty\nThe electoral college it was four hundred and eighty six to LBJ in fifty two\nTo Barry Goldwater she got destroyed if you're in the moment if you're living in that time Nineteen sixty four well gosh that speech didn't do as a heck of a lot of good we just got murdered\nBut historically you can see yeah we got LBJ and he's sucked but it also get us Reagan so that's why I like to do\nSo talking about this was a bit worn thin I think I Am of the impression that Brock Obama\nDoomed the Democrats his success do Democrats a lot of this is what you see a lot of this is the Obama model but Obama was lightning in a bottle\nThere isn't another ... does that Brock Obama win out there and he got Ninety seven percent of the black vote\nVery very difficult for Republicans overcome when anybody gets Ninety seven percent of the black vote that's probably going to be a win and it was it was went for him the Democrats saw that\nAnd thought boy this identity politics thing is a winner\nIf we just siphon off this group and this group and this group and this group\nThat is going to be a winner for us but it's not and it wasn't a winter for them post Obama as soon as Obama got elected they started losing seats because you can't duplicate Obama\nObama's first midterm wiped out in the house slaughtered you guys know the story by now eight years of Obama the last eight thousand seats the Democrats did nationwide\nAnd now what are they are leading candidates\nFor US President that she was she was I Believe number two or three in the running already ... cording to pools for to win the ... democratic nomination for president she's finished\nWhy\nShe hipster walk into the identity politics dream\nIt's destroying them\nDemocrats are being consumed by their own insanity they allowed Obama to tell them things that weren't true or they took they interpreted things from Obama that simply were not true\nThere were not this crushing them which Russia to Elizabeth Warren is very likely dumb now she came out this story came out today and of course\nThe media all tried to run cover for right off the bat you can go look all over the line of everybody's saying Elizabeth Warren vindicated you know my wife was watching the view had it on in the background and every one of a to a woman said oh yeah well\nNow that she's finally vindicated I Wonder if Trump or apologize and the story had already unraveled by that obviously it looks bad\nBut by tonight it's going real bad for Elizabeth Warren\nThe Cherokee Nation themselves Arctic came out with a damaging damaging statement on it here I read it to your right here this is\nFrom ... Oklahoma don't correct me on my pronunciations Chris I went to community college I can say words however I Want to say words okay I went to community college and that we still have to talk by the way about you going out to more security not\nBuying anything this weekend ... anyway the statement is\nA DNA test as useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tested out even distinguish whether a person the ancestors were indigenous to the north or South America\nCherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior said then I'll skip down to the end use a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any travel nation even vaguely is inappropriate\nAnd wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses well also this honoring the legitimate trouble governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well document\nDocumented and who's heritage is proven Senator Warren is undermining the tribal interest words or continued claims of tribal heritage Elizabeth Warren\nStepped in it she is now knee deep in it\nAnd she did it to herself and this is what I was talking about what Trump Chris you have that audio today from Trump from drum they asked Trump\nToday about it after the storm hit unraveled jumps down there the red cross thing he's standing there was ... doing hurricane stuff today and of course some reporter who didn't do her own research thought she was going to do a little gotcha\nOn Trump band or here's here's out when\nVery loud [laughter] why do you have\nA highly ... she got married and have one one [laughter]\nWhy did I\nGet a fallacy [laughter]\nWhat are the first one one thousand\nI don't know when when you have a shot I Want to call her and what\nI mean as you say where are you\nAll a narrative I hadn't yet or are certainly not something I enjoy doing either [laughter]\nUp it's such a vicious Savage [laughter] but he's right by the way Republicans civic away from the Warren thing for a second take notes\nYou know Chris I just I I think that there's a there's an adaptation going on in my thinking and it's maybe something I've been a little slower than some of my other colleagues on the right to adopt in some ways because I come from this perspective of\nWell this'll sound self aggrandizing but knowledge having a background in in the actual work that I Do especially in the national security side knowledge and facts\nAnd wisdom that's how I tried to approach would I Do and and so I always want to think that I could have\nLiberals listen to this show and I certainly hope to all the liberals who are listening that they still feel this way but I Want them to know that I I Want to bring them over to my side a and I don't want to be too strident that has always been my approach but recently the left has gone insane and so I Am separating out in my mind\nI Want to say and saying I mean more insane than usual I separated in my mind how I speak to Democrats really in general from how I'm now speaking to the hardcore left because I Am an ideological war with the hardcore left a centrist Democrats\nI Want to come over to my side not necessarily even on everything but them whatever they're willing to\nBut the hardcore left just must be ideologically smashed and\nAnd destroyed it must be defeated you know the anti ... the ah the people that are running around with the pink hats on and that are saying due process doesn't count anymore and they they the ones who are doing deep platform and want people to be boycotted and to be fired from their jobs for\nExpressing conservative opinions when we have to fight that ideology not not meet it in\nA gentlemanly contest but we actually have to throw some elbows and that that maybe has been a a learning process for me in this Arab Trump because I've seen more and more of what the left\nAnd not just with the left is but how much of\nThe Democrat Party and how much of the ideological a center to laugh they control and the hard left him in the progressive vanguard is way too prominent way too powerful and can and cannot be\nA just wished away any more so if I sound at all like I'm a little more strident or a little more uh fired up about things in the last few months it's really because I've seen this battle we're entering into is all about\nAnd this is political total war this is not a you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak and that kind of political environment you ... you have to be ready to to go bare knuckle and and in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump you know there there have\nBeen some things that Trump is Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that such a mistake oh my gosh how could Trump if have gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize who we are dealing with\nWith Trump or and then time passes and I realized wait a second he was right not to apologize for that they would have just mould him like a like a ... I was going to say a flock of Iran has but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging per on us or that they they would have torn apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or is when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people or how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and an objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well and make changes\nAnd I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear everyday yes I like to present information and there's an aspect of this that's\nA really just about dare I say it's far from the left community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I add quip\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs either ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and as never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time\n... writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty\nI'm a loyal pod cast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier\nSo us folks up here in Alaska can listen to it on the way home shields on thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the podcast is out sooner and I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast knows that we're pretty much now our podcast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo you know ... there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to it a little early ... you don't have to wait and wait for it to be rebroadcast her to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume podcasts are and so that's great news and you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary and her security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just completely it should've been horrifically embarrassing or for anybody not just\nAssociated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense\nThat she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nWhat am I knew all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends at Stanford research there'll be about\nWhat's coming next in the markets and big big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full [noise]\nLive event this Friday just go to book event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free ... events dot com and getting ...
