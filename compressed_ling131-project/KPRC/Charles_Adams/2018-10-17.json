there is somebody who knows a lot more than me about immigration Brandon Darby your rights Breitbart\nHe has this amazing series called the cartel chronicles if you have not read the cartel chronicles unique to there are a million people out there who pretend they know what they're talking about\nThis guy actually does brand and my friend was going on for the\nHey thank you for having me on and I hope you're having a good either I'm Glad you're talking about this stuff and I'm Glad you're bringing attention to the work that we're doing\nGreat work now tell me I I see this migrant Caribbean and pretend I Know nothing about it coming from Honduras who is coming why are they coming what's what are we doing about uh tell me about this thing\nWell you\nKnow this is where things get really tricky because we have a we have a situation where you're first off\nYou know the project that we work on we go after cartel we advocate for a exposing cartels we advocate for the U.S government to aggressively go after these cartel boxes\nUh we're up in their face way try to be a voice for border patrol agents were all about border security but we're also all about holding people accountable for what I see right now\nIs I see yet another caravan of of a thousand plus people coming from Central America coming to the United states and what most people here don't realize is that what those people are doing is actually legal\nIt is legal our laws are written in a way\nWhere a thousand people are Thirteen hundred people can come from Central America\nCan come across our border even not at a port of entry just that the river and they can say I'm here because I Want to ... I don't feel safe at home\nAnd then they get to stay temporarily so it's actually legal so what I see right now as I see a lot of us politicians specifically Republicans when they control the White House they control the the house or Senate or a most state government must stay like you know we go down the line of what Republicans control\nAnd they're pointing their finger and they're like\nHonduras better stop that Mexico better stock that will ... what they want is they want you to focus on those people and they want you to be upset at them so you don't hold them accountable for the fact that they haven't fixed our immigration laws\nSo basically what you're telling me is the average Honduran apparently knows or immigration laws better than the average American\nCitizen who believes are all politicians when they lie to us now you say that this is legal\nWhat law where did it come from who passed it why haven't we stopped it and that's one question to you see they can just show up where do they have to show up\nWell that that's what's tricky to the law actually just that's all they have to do is step on us soil if they're on us soil you know that's a lot of people don't realize right like they don't realize\nWe we did an interview recently with this amazing border patrol agent and Manuel ... he's the chief border patrol agent in the Rio Grande valley sector he's the head of the the border a court or that encompasses the Rio Grande valley Laredo an Del Rio sector this guy's amazing and\nA longtime board of Georgia a head of the of the operations there he said half of what we need it\nThe security but the other half is all about policy changes a lot changes security won't do anything about some of these problems\nSo when people come here and they have a baby on us soil\nAnd that baby becomes a U.S citizen haven't while all the border security in the world won't change that when people come here and they ask for asylum having a wall won't change that all they have to do is be on us territory so\nIn the Rio Grande valley sector most of the areas that they're building fencing or have already built theft thing it's up to forty meters into the United states some of it you know hundreds and hundreds of meters right one someplace that it's even a mile and a U.S territory\nAnd all it takes is someone to come across that border\nAnd to get onto our soil and say hey I'm pregnant I'm having a baby if their past seven months pregnant they can't be sent town that's the law that's the rules\nIf anyone over seven months pregnant who comes onto our territory has a baby and that babies a citizen anyone that comes down to our territory from any nation other than Mexico or Canada\nA and says hey I seek asylum than we have to process that it doesn't matter if it's a on the outside of the wall around the inside so I don't think people realize these laws a lot of them were were passed with our immigration our immigration current immigration laws were passed and they were a response to things that happened during the Holocaust\nSo er during the Holocaust a lot of young Jewish children showed up on boats are a lot of Jewish people showed up on the boats and because the U.S couldn't process their their requests for asylum\nThey were sent back in a lot of them we can look and go okay we they actually died in concentration camps so what's happened is we have these laws that say okay even if we can't process you if you show up here\nAnd we can't process you well we're not going to send your back to a possibly back situation well that's where these laws come from and that's why they're so hard to change obviously the situation in Central America is very different than what happened in Nazi Germany I'm\nSo glad that's where they come from one wants\nTo change that because they're afraid to look like the people on doing protections that came from the Holocaust\nSo we had these Arctic laws from the ... from World war two days in World War two days All right that's that's that's fine okay no politician has had the guts are not enough of them to change these laws up until now\nNow is a partisan hack like I Am tell me why we\nHave Donald Trump ... strong on immigration and in my eyes has been great on illegal immigration you please correct me if I'm wrong we have the Senate\nWe have the house why are these laws not already changed\nWell I don't really think it's Trump fall I I think there are some things that Trump does that I'm In fact I'm not sure there\nAre some things that Trump does that kind of sharks responsibility from those who are responsible which would be lawmakers in Congress\nUm uh but there are some things that Trump does that that that diverts attention from them and I wish you wouldn't do but for the most part Trump Trump really has\nPressed his presidential authority as much as he can when it comes to our actual border or when it comes to illegal immigration when it comes to a a ice agents when it comes to border patrol agents they have a higher morale than I've ever seen and I've been covering this issue for many many years\nUh uh they have a yes or things are things are going better but the real issues that are at play here when it comes to our border and our security and says something no one talked about it's a holistic approach the border security right so the bottom line is\nIs as long as as cartels transnational criminal organizations control portions of our border\nOr in Mexico right our shared border with Mexico as long as that's happening we're really not going to have a secure border these are multi billion dollar a year companies and efforts there are they are going to get their drugs and they are going to get their people and and there's gonna be violence an unsafe innocent people are going to flee that\nSo the problem the real core of the problem is that our state department\nWhich used to the Obama State Department and now it is Donald Trump State Department that same people who were who were running that State Department in Mexico or are they saying for Obama or the same ones doing it for Trump and what they do is they routinely insists that\nNeurosurgery prove to me and she proved her case going she just you know you know she's one one million serve a Native American which means I'm Native American\n[laughter] it was really an astonishing attempt to justify what was one of the dumbest political moves I've I've ever seen in my entire life you know yeah she's she's\nOne one thousand and twenty four bit of American show yeah shoes part Native American this was this is this is actually taken straight out of the dumb and dumber play about you guys remember that\n[noise] what do you think the chances are [noise]\nI like

older and wiser but but nonetheless I\nI did enjoy it in its day uh Elizabeth\nWarren that's right so you're telling me there are some Native American and they're yeah like one of the million there you go\nBrand and writes the will be is a punctual liner it is every infantry man's best friend and or security blanket airborne all the way random thanks right near man I did not know what it will be was and now I feel a educated on the subject so thank you so much for that it is\nVery very appreciated\nKayla brides there's got to be a way to get the dawn to take a DNA test I bet he's\nMore Indian then focus haunt us well Caleb considering that a book I mean I'm Sorry Elizabeth Warren ... is less Native American than the average American based on genetic testing that we know of\nA it would not be surprising I think to anyone to find out that she is in fact less Native American than President Trump and that would be amusing but I think she's been thoroughly owned as the kids say on this subject I think she's been\nShown to be a political phoney and in New ... and so there's no need for Trump to continue to a dance on her burial ground so to speak ah let's see what we have next
