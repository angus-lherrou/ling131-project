time he was um there's nobody better recovering the boardroom what's going on Brendan\nHow many people are coming to our border are we taking necessary steps are we doing everything we can what is happening\nWell you know it's interesting I'm a great to be on the show again thank you for having me I think's or cared about this issue you know my team definitely appreciate that support that you give us\nA what what we have right now as a situation where up to seven thousand people are in a caravan that's coming to the border everyone's up in arms about it um\n[noise] uh especially on the right ah everyone's that fat a it's a hot news item to cover but the the problem with this coverage is is that just this year we've had about ten thousand people per month\nGet caught coming across our border that's not people who came at ports of entry who flew in and state I'm Talking about people who came in between ports of entry in areas where there weren't walls or fences who tried to come into our country illicit Lee or illegally um we had about ten thousand per month this\nYear and that you all the time to ask you a quick ... it was my understanding from a friend who worked at a border patrol you told me differently they are they seeing\nThrough or at least this is what he thought at the time they thought they were catching twenty to thirty percent of those who are coming across now that I get that writer on my way off\nWell you could be both and the reason is that some sectors\nThank they catch about that percentage other sectors thing they catch about fifty five percent it just depends on the sector there's nine on the southwest border as you know\nI'm a and it just depends on the sector each sector all the way from the Rio Grande valley sector Laredo sector Del Rio big band El Paso sector that goes all the way to ah the Arizona New Mexico border and then that becomes the Tucson sector ... else intro and in San Diego\nAnd all of the factors are dealing with something different all of them are facing a different situation or if you go to the human sector they catch a higher percentage if you're in the Archie the Laredo sector they catch a match lower percentage of people why how and so it it uh because of the terrain because of the nature of the criminal groups and because of\nThe amount of border security on the on our side of the border you might use to be a hot spot they built a three chaired fencing system for most of the factor is extremely effective\nUh the El Paso sector used to be a hot spot they built the ... the the proverbial wall or during the Bush and Obama years\nAnd it was very effective to the San Diego sector used to be a hot spot and they built a concrete wall and a a step multi tiered fencing system and that was very effective and so now the areas left on the border that don't have\n'em that don't have a lot of border security are sufficient border security are are the hot spot the violence in Mexico follows the least secure spots on the border stuff we've secured the Archie tomorrow the Rio Grande valley sector\nThen another spot would become the violent hot spot right now the reason Mexico as chaotic south of the Rio Grande valley sector\nIs largely because there is a lack of security there and the cartels want that corner door so they're fighting each other for that lucrative court or because that's where they can get the most people and drugs into the country without getting their load the by us\nLaw enforcement so they're all eyes are always fighting over the easiest route in the United states of the violence is constantly moving east to west across Mexico do I get that right\n[noise] pretty much that's the way it it works I mean that there are some exceptions to that there's\nThere's some aspects of you know like the nature of the criminal organization south of um the ... how they generally they have their pattern of behavior\nYou know uh that the age of the average leader and the cartel\nYou know you go to the ... cartel there there's older and more mature leadership so it's like the Italian mob there they want to make money today but they they're thinking about their future profits and there's ... ... they're they're sustainability of their profits work you go south Texas the criminal groups we have\nOur younger gang bangers guy with a lot of money and they don't care about tomorrow so they're willing to do things even if it means that tomorrow it's going to hurt them and cause more security to happen they don't care\nWhat are the names of those groups I understand it a little girl I think most people do it's my understanding I think that they are the biggest and most\nPowerful at least they were for quite awhile who is their main competitor or competitors in our ... our the competitors nature differ from a low or is it just that they're younger and more violent\nNow okay so so when we say cartel we say that as well so it's not an accurate but really what it is it's it's really a federation so there are preexisting\nA regional criminal groups like if you took Arizona the Arizona border is controlled by the ... cartel but if you really get into the nitty gritty it's controlled by low Salazar cartel and lost memos cartel in both lost their most of the salaries are at war with each other\nThey're but they're both just seen a lower cartel because they're both regional criminal groups who have sworn allegiance to the skin a low a federation right\nIt's asking really stupid question or if I'm the ... cartel and I have two businesses of mine that are fighting each other why don't I step in and say hey idiots knock it off your costs money\nWell that's the catch as as it's not as if not it closely control they don't really care they just want their drugs to come through\nFood water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers that can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three\nAnd three or four years for hearing bull crap or early on you know you're you're actually much more\nSolution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that we don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum that's what they will do\nRight so it's not a decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum defensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song but you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor\nAnd they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these ... properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against them they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo but are are in your ear at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a a a set up\nAt the border where was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse\nUnder the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so they're kick you write down there and you know you get justice dispensed right away you get your fine or you go to jail or whatever so it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're\nYou're on the right track my friend Bryan writes bucks still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in Kansas we're actually well beyond time candidates did an incredible\nJob holding her ground oh to be a fly on the wall pre and post that segment\nCanisters fears no there's no two ways about it I mean she you know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look crystal from the left is also very tenacious so it was quite as I can tell a lot of you that that's all just that it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that ah that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect for aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so\nWe will see a\nJosh book I Want to thank you for writing my day after long stressful day it's nice to listen in on the drive home you're accurate depiction of Hillary Clinton's cackle while thank you\nAfter ten years and he told us later field I got out disillusioned in part because of Hillary Clinton when I hear you or impersonate Hillary I Can't help but smile and chocolate and it makes me feel a little bit better about the world and the country and that at least some of us understand who these people really are\nFrom Josh I'm Josh I'm I'm Glad that I can bring a little Lebanon into things and uh just just remember that how did you so there you go about my it sounds Hillary sounds a little bit more like ... these days I'm really going to be fair to the truth here a\nBrittany writes in podcast listener just wanted to put in my two cents I've never had a problem with your podcast they sound perfect on my end maybe it's their iPhone I Love you shields Hi Brittany I Love you too and the door with a\nPhoto of your baby you have up here on Facebook or who looks very very precious\nSo thank you so much for writing and I'm Glad that you have a um a an easy time listening and the podcast and like I said guys most nights we're going to pop cast out early early early\nUm because in some places the show was on a little bit of a delay in the in the local market on the on the affiliate so as soon as we can we get that podcast up\nSo you should be able most of you should be able to listen to this uh this show in full on your way home from work these days is if you're on the west coast one hundred percent\nAnd beyond that um you know\nWe're getting closer and closer hopefully before dinnertime you can listen to the whole the whole show Robin writes\nYou probably can't comment on this but what is happening se cup I'm truly concerned we need a no man left behind policy for our conservative punted to decide to work and CNN or find that extract plans when they approached the Kool Aid it's sudden it suddenly occurred to me who your friends and CNN or that were urging him to tone down your rhetoric\nSo sad a well rounded a couple of things uh as she is a dear friend\nAnd I have nothing but\nPositive things to say about her and wish or nothing but the best and everything that she's doing because a personal loyalty an honor and friendship\nCome before the debate for me you know what I mean that's that's just the way that it is and uh essays are a great lady and very very talented\nAh as to anyone telling it turned out my rhetoric oh no it was never see she she wouldn't do that uh it was other people it was actually a pretty prominent Anchorage see it a couple of pretty prominent anchors at CNN have told me to a reached out to me to tell me to tone it down\nAnd I I think to my credit refrain from pulling in Costa and reading back something profane in response which I definitely thought about but I ... I Try to\nOne day folks I mean let it slip with or not on this show obviously but it you know I may let it slip on Twitter or something so one of the CNN anchors how I really think about them with some colorful language but I'll Try not to I just I Can't make any promises\nBut I'll Try I'll Try not to uh Jason writes buck buddy on Monday show you said that Stacey Abrams might win here in Georgia I'm telling you she don't stand a chance she's already maxed out the maximum for Democrats support in the state she's been line about voter suppression here's one she loses she has an excuse as long as Republicans show up she's toast\nEarly voting is being led by the GOP Jason ... man I Hope you're right so I and I'm not a Georgia electoral\nExpert or election expert I'm just you know just ...

Texas would come to make the drive into corpus we'd always go to why it because my great grandmother Evelyn that was you know her place\nBut absent her we would eat at three places with either water or where my grandmother would make\nPlace ... because she was hyper concern with cleanliness or we would go to a Corpus Christi country club or we get fried shrimp and cheesecake every single time and then we'd go swimming or something\nBut more often than not we found ourselves at Louis and I just always loved Louise I'm you know we can start from the back end of it the the cheese\nI think it was a cheese icebox pie where you had a gram cracker crust on top and the bottom in like a cheesecake like substance in the middle\nThat was just absolutely amazing right um but\n[noise]\n\nIt was the whole deal you know whether I got the fried fish or the fried shrimp or the chicken fried steak you'd always get the the\nRole to\nSmooth shut the mashed potatoes with or you get the corn bread to make a corn bread and butter macaroni sandwich and it was always just this amazing unique inconsistent good experience\nYou know I loved it is what my love affair with iced tea and lives not lemons began at movies uh the lady would push the quarter round that you'd fill up your iced tea or to worry about going to get a refill from the soda and this is in the seventies and eighties when\nFree cell refills we're not actually a thing as I think that really emerged in the late mid to late eighties you kids won't remember that\nBut you always get refills iced tea and Louis they would have both lemons and lived in the trial and I being the contrarian started using ... and my iced tea and just just loved it from a little kid on [noise]\nAnd it was that consistency of experience\nNot the high quality food and that's a low quality food just consistently food\nThat made it such a wonderful place and going through the line was neat the whole thing I continue dating losers Louis on the Gulf freeway while as classic old big you know brick building movies um I think it was just north of ... between Broadway Monroe that I Would eat where we need it all the time when I was a policeman\nUm and we just you know whether they're good officers I think it was a fifty percent discount but I just love movies in fact I was the one that will drag other officers there\nUm and it's just been a part of my life my entire life I'm fortunate that my beautiful wife also has an affection for movies but they are struggling now losing money huge ships closing stores\n\nAnd the reason is that inconsistency them met Gregor location is just awful the post up one behind the radio stations pretty fantastic\nBut\nIt just seems like the rest of America and I know it's being silly\nBut they're used to be some things that you could count on and you used to be able to count on a fantastic meal of the movies and you just can't anymore and they can replace all the CEOs though want like they are the the guy he began as an assistant manager I liked the story came up through the ranks\nBut unless they stop having\nServers who aren't serving you anything and you just feel obligated to tip 'em in return to the woman what the court\nUnless they start delivering a consistent product Louis is going to die and be gone forever and that is going to break my heart but there's a lot of things in America that are going to die unless we can start delivering consistency again\nWhich is kind of get better and I don't necessarily think we have a better\nWe've gotta get consistent\nAnd I know this is a silly wasted segment\nBut Louis dying and kind of breaks my heart this\nCharles Adams this is the night shift if you disagree with you they will resist trash telling me a beginning rely on
