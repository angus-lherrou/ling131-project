UH cougar ... feet are Bud Light inbox also we have a microphone in my lap and we'll get to your question as well but first we have three give a wasted eight three trivia giveaways ah we're giving away I hats\nAnd also a pair of tickets to this Saturday's game against Texas southern I've seen a section wrote undersea number they're good seats you're gonna want to get the trivia question first one to Andrew in our first just three\nThe only other time Houston is face Texas southern was it two thousand and said who is the Houston starting quarterback in that game will give you a hand he's my favorite quarterback of all time no offense coach Applewhite\nAbout a who was a quarterback for you to take a few thousand seven when the cougars played Texas southern the only other time series history\nIncorrect [laughter]\nI didn't hear what you said I knew was incorrect so seven ... how does your out first the last uh starting the last two teams played he was ... starting quarterback if you tell bad for the young man with the writing it and what the answer is you'll get a hair tickets and a hat\nOr the or what the heck you can wear a Texas southern the tickets are protects us that as well\nSix I'm just trying to I'm just going through my and trying to get this honestly I 'cause I don't know the answer you don't know the answer for me I Know when I was at rice with like Houston is six and it was covers the quarterback or just didn't know if he was still there and stuff [noise]\nPretty good quarterback hello sir how are you what's your name a question for go chop away my\nName is Ben and the fact you coach for your show every way [noise] I saw first second quarter back apart or just found [noise] I'm\nWhat you said that you think you will be able to correct [noise] for the future as we say other good passing tennis [noise]\nPlus a good question um you know the first thing that we've got to do is we can always put a rush on on the pastor and\nYou know we we got some situations you know going into that game Saturday a that kid had never been sucked into games and it's all missing them our number ... your four or five guys and the returning on the opposite blonde a really good age to returning starts a if you rush for common sense tells you there's one double team and there's three singles\nAnd we blitz forty five percent of the time going into the game we had been around sixty sixty one percent of who was about forty five percent of the time we got one sec had given up to sex but we've got to do a better job of defeating the one on ones up front\nOr when we get you one on one of the game you got to win but you know you've got to give credit to those guys do but we've got to where we got to do a better job of rushing the passer nothing creates\nMore issues that put pressure on the kid with the ball and then secondly we've got to be a ... and not give up huge place we had some situations where [noise]\nYou know just from a coaching standpoint just jargon you have a post safety means his job is to be in the post and do nothing supposed to go beyond him behind him and when you're a post safety posted into your head [noise] that's why it's called a post safety so there's just some simple things and we go back to how you create or as you know how to evaluate your tape\nYou look at the mental assignments you look at the effort you look at the techniques we had some mental assignments or we have some technique issues where we didn't win a one on ones up front so those are the two things that I look at in terms of just our mental assignments in the back in and create pressure on the quarterback or what you call is not as important as in terms of how you how you actually you know how they're executing is how we coach\nAnd so that's what we got to go back and look and see are we not coaching these things are right where we give him too many things we simplify so this guy can cut loose a little bit more and play play with more freedom starts that answer your question [noise]\nJust just thank you for that question Ben I'm ... you mentioned that the blocking up front and we we always talk about it at all of her and now the other team put together their game plan that kind of around all over how did you notice Texas Tech blocking upfront\nWell they didn't spend a lot of time trying to block them up front you know I mean when they could get triple teams on in the past you know when you're dropping the eight or in the covered you're going to rush three\nUh we did that I think it was ten times where I counted up we had ten times out of a hundred and six naps so it's not as much as you think it gets to throw team\nUm but but again and two of those eight man drops we've got holding calls you know obviously still creating a Bush still create penalties\nUm you know books but just looking back at the tape that that's really the two things that stand out as pass rush and mental assignments and the second are now you're going to always when you say you play bad defensively didn't take the ball when you didn't tackle\nBut how do we give up those huge place you're allowed to sit back there are a little bit longer and you're on the wrong place and the secondary and that that creates a huge explosives\nYou mentioned all ways over a hundred plays in the game against a Texas Tech but they are often ... what were the effects of that what kind of told did that take on on your defense\nIs a lot of naps but you know that it doesn't matter whether you go out there and staff at sixty times or a hundred and six tiles your job is to hold them to one less point uh our job often so we use to score sixty four and\nAnd that's that that's what Saturday dictator and that's that's what we\nDemand is coaches as it doesn't matter what they score a job as a score one more you know the cliche cliche cliche but that's the reality of it yeah or when your defense goes out there the first six years of the game and stops and for the first six years the gang or job is to put once on the damn for when your defense goes out there just two or three stops in the second half in terms of a game that's going back and forth you got a whole serving score\nThat that's where we have to do and so you know it's it's not tough talk it's reality that's the type of game I knew it was going to be up in a part of that game for Twenty years I Know exactly what it's like playing out there in Lubbock at night\nUh it gets a little bit easier as Tom moves up but it's still a tough place to play on when you run into a quarter back to ... and said why don't they can catch it you got to hold onto your tail is going to be an all day deal and it got to be an all day deals and seven more game with Thirteen bucks to go on the fourth quarter we didn't finish\nOf the things that we talked about a lot really early part of the season is building death you know we talked about it in Arizona when you wanted to play the Tuesday in threes and a third quarter because you know you're going to need those guys you mentioned earlier the show if you don't believe we're gonna play just ask me um how do you build depth in a hurry especially in a secondary when the injuries that you had to you\nYou add against a Texas that\nYou just you built up by ... van reps repetition the only way for true confidence of successful represents successful repetition that's it\nEverything else it's counterfeit fake so you've got to get out there in the game when it matters you gotta get out there and practice you go sometimes put your ones off and say hey at a temp plays y'all get three a day and the two are going to do something because they need more ups and that's the only way you can get real confidence is through successful repetition\nGleason spray well we saw a lot of a lot of hand with that safety spot what's the scattered report on spring well as a matter of course play a big role for going forward\nYeah starter so he's got to show up boy well and so he was in there Monday and song spend time with coach Morgan ... not for real [noise]\nUm you know out there on the practice but he's got a great uh demeanor though he ... he wants to do well he knows that a lot span expected him now as well as a lot of other duties but but he's got the right mentality in terms of attacking it not shying away from it he wants to roll we watched that responsibility\nUm you know there's some guys who owns a you know oh boy this is my turn now so he's excited about it and he'll he'll play well\nIf you have a question for coach Applewhite can Swedish a U H trigger happy for our Bud Light in botch also a microphone to my left would take a quick break away come back we'll give it away another pair of tickets and also take a look at the opposite side of the football it's a major apple I joined the Houston I Am ... except\nFor this is their wings radio spot that can't be stopped there's no escape you could look away but this is

soup kitchens\nI unfortunately haven't well schooled in this communication style by nurses just acts the behavior of all these types of participants was appalling but unfortunately rather familiar\nUm and a bunch of privilege prep school kids with way too much money and freedom and no supervision I saw some of that when I was in school and is anyone remember Animal House that movie made its mark because it was real this was not a fantasy about space aliens\nUm those yearbook entries tell the tale beach week Ralph club a hundred and ... run off the alumnus and the most telling devil's triangle which basically describes them as sports does happen with the two boys\nHe dismissed them all with Lindsay explanations that would never succeed during questioning by any parent or principal or dean doesn't he realized that many of us were there and it's counter shows use a two or three people are like I got I got to tell you I'm\nI\nI just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting\nBut I think that you are not properly contextualize ing how a person like having all would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school\nIt doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in a in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did cabin on do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and she has only certain\nThat Kavanaugh's the bad guy I find that a little too convenient I don't believe it I don't believe that her memory is accurate\nMaybe she believes that this happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events squares with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so\nDon't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you I I strongly disagree with your entire\nPremise on all of this um or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all this\nWith a new FBI investigation look into the will the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn when she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six\nYears ago max let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for\nWhy is it that lousy Ford is a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was ah in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that\nNone of that can be discussed that meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed why is that\nBecause he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe it for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that is not taken\nSeriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously there's a reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very serious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nJennifer I'd say their pocket cash listener here first thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason and being hilarious at the same time quick question maybe you can help me with this\nIn terms of the lie detector tests what I've seen release was documentation of missed for being asked two questions by the administrator in regards to the statement she

now Jennifer I don't think he missed anything I think the two questions test\nSeems suspect me all along and I think that the whole polygraph in a way that they have been trying to hold this up as the biggest piece of objective evidence they have I think that it's\nA I I think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason and I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here is all coordinated if you didn't want if she didn't want to come forward\nWhy don't you take that polygraph no one's ever given me a satisfactory answer answer that question no one\nRaymond ... unrelated to current political happenings\nI've heard you speak briefly on investments and some stands for research related information could you briefly speak your

G. yeah and of course a new album\nReturn or the true out now all format you somebody you can stream it doesn't matter to me\nNow last saying when we were talking about the second amendment in your support of the second amendment\nBut you're agreement better that it should that we should restrict the sales a certain type of firearms obviously I vehemently disagree a constitutional originalists and I think we should be able to defend ourselves from the government just about anything else but\nYou mentioned that we don't know some of the people\nThat do these horror find things that we're seeing almost weekly you know these mass shootings you don't know that they're the people that are going to do it\nAnd I think one of the problems that America is that we are focused law enforcement energies on revenue ing and prohibition basically so cops instead of being proactive enforcers of safety\nRight are often\nTied up with traffic ticket quotas or enforcing the war on drugs\nOr relationship issues right not demented I necessarily domestic violence but just domestic issues well into\nThe other team if you go to a house or taking someone that you have to be physical abuse it's so I just\nThink our law enforcement needs to be allowed and I don't blame the individual officers I blame the administration and the counties in the ... put so much pressure on them to generate income by asset forfeiture to generate income by rank tickets [noise]\nUm I think they need to focus back on the original night watch just protecting people and things from things from protecting people from bad people in protecting people's possession from\nThese um [noise] one of the ways you do that is ending the war on drugs battles spoke about his desire to end the\nProhibition of marijuana and then to allow possess or she didn't get into whether traffickers or not we'll give expansions with people from your possession get their records expunged allow them to re integrate fully into society without a criminal record uh what do you think about battles position on the war on drugs I agree with it um\nAgain we don't want it to become a free rein where people you know drug trafficking gets out of hand and that kind of if they if you look at Los Angeles for example Los Angeles being legalized state and legalize recreational they just passed um initiative to where you can actually carry\nUp to twenty eight grams of marijuana into LAX\nAnd fly wherever you are going to fly now just because it's and and the argument aged that LAX\nIs still within Los Angeles ... within the county so any ... anywhere in the county you should be able to possess into the airport is fine with that too right now the problem is where are you flying to ... and his dad illegal state so I think from now on like say going from\nLA or San Francisco to Denver, Colorado or something like that I think they're going to actually allow people to possess marijuana\nOr are these kind of flights um but again this is personal use right this is not about a guy that wants to take a couple of pounds and bring up somewhere and try to flip you know brought over the drugs um but yeah I think the possession of marijuana you know and even in even in in Harris County right as there's a little bit of leniency right you can\nYou can apparently you can carry up to a certain amount of marijuana as long as you don't cross county ...\nWell it's still it's still illegal ... if you're interested in ... well\nThe the Harris County district attorney's office intake is told not to accept charges on the possession of small amounts of marijuana unless it's combined with another crime like if there's a weapon in the car they charge you appeal possession of marijuana and I'm all for Ken this is from the new deal is from ... um she's been very proactive about the problem that are found as a criminal defense attorney\nIs people will be driving in suburban Houston and realize they've crossed over into Fort band or resorted county ... county Montgomery County where none of those prosecutors have signed onto this deal and they're going to jail and they're surprised that they are going to jail or you know I think that\nEveryone should treat marijuana like it's illegal till it's legal and we should but I Am a staunch advocate and I agree with better on this\nUm I just you know it it it really comes to I don't know how you prioritize the issues you and he went on and on about\nFree\nCollege though he wasn't he didn't define it wasn't even free junior college or free but that the finances shouldn't be an impediment to ending college do you think we should in our paradigm where we are socializing higher education and spreading that cost everyone or\nWell I think I think a lot of families in this state um would be happy and in this country\nRather more so would be happy if that was another expense that they didn't have to pay for out of pocket right and we see places where free education isn't really a detriment to anyone right right I'm going to college for ... you know if if there's so many families in America\nWho unfortunately can't afford\nTo send their kids to the kind of college that maybe their kid gets accepted to write you know if you have a kid he's been studios he does everything ready supposed to be keeps a high GPA gets accepted into you know an Ivy League university and then you can't afford to pay for the job to wish I\nDidn't really exist with I was ... million or so out of it if you are right there private but more importantly if you are in the lower income bracket you're free at almost any I think every ... at this point rice where you teach a class on Robert religion had announced a couple of weeks ago\nBut really if you were under a hundred and thirty grand a year or family income you're going for free [noise]\nUm I wasn't I would've stopped working for a few years just to get my hundred and fifty thousand dollars of giving them so far but I Do think there are families that can afford it that don't prioritize it I Do think people can work their way and I do think we got to get because I did you know I worked all the way through school I think that we've got to get to a point where we're stop\nThis promise of everything free because how do we figure out how to pay for it all I mean you listen to the ... because they're Cortez\nAnd she's not a progressive she's a social so I'm a ... as a socialist so people love to say he's a socialist right if you look at around ... stop there um but he is waiving the promise of free around\nWhich I don't necessarily think because there are ... so we can do more I mean we have to have a window of opportunity in America\nAnd I think we want people to to have I think the problem is the abuse of the system right right that's that's where I'm at you and I talk about these things all the time whenever these initiatives come forward it's not about the actual concept of it is how do you keep people from abusing riots them\nSpending six years working on a a basket weaving degree or so I mean you know if we're gonna make something free why don't we make trade schools free that's always been Christmas position is that you know people can go learn to weld or or do I mean there's so much money and stuff that people don't think makes money\nI'm Chris actually was attending the junior cause because he wanted to be in radio one that has a great ... Alvin community college great radio program\nBut when he got the opportunity to come here and work fulltime he stopped going to school you know he said I went to school to learn the specific thing I learned it and now I'm doing it and I want to do that until I can get into radio what so but it's radios in from behind the board on to the microphones\nAlthough he was your job I'd say yeah and I mean these were threats for twenty two years old the other I admire the initiative\n[noise] um I Would just I just think this one of the problems with the left is that they promised to much free and when we looked at the war on poverty that Johnson started I mean look what it did to not just African American households put a lot of poor whites porous panics just poor Americans\nThere were you forced the father of the home to get the benefits I mean did you see them at all growing up or was that import author was more family centered a brain right\nYeah for a certain amount of time my parents were together and then they divorced um I didn't see anything society that kind of was forcing my dad out of the house he made his own conscious decision as to why he\nArrived but your dad worked in contributed a participant and I mean but you are not affair while he was on the horizon yet when you were not a family on the Dole no none of 'em where I'd uh but you go into inner city America use ... sometimes you have a majority of people are on the Dole and I think it's a I\nLooked and there are there are a lot of situations within welfare I can be very honest about this type of thing that people are taking advantage of the welfare system and\nIt's a great lie to save that as black people because it's a lot\nOf ... and all that amount of why are you one I Know that it's on welfare and run not black right when I did that and it's not I mean it's\nObviously there was a legacy of intergenerational poverty that stems from the the translator slave trade in Jim Crow but there's also a legacy of generational poverty for a great number white Americans over you look at West Virginia and you [noise] but [noise]\nWhat do we do to open the windows of opportunity to make more Americans have the chance to achieve that want to achieve\nUnless the monitoring I've never been against this new concept of wanting people\nTo if you're going to take from you know the American taxpayer if you're going to be on welfare\n[noise]\nI have you with is the Joe ... show it eight nine four one ...
