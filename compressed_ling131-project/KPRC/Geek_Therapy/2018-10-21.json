Central American migrants stuck in southern Mexico on the Guatemalan border as part of a caravan heading to the United states\nRadio [laughter] fiance\nIs a Red Sox fan so she's kind of happy for me and Sarah what throughout this\nWhole serious ... every time the Astros win back God you know behind just a couple of runs ... and I would go to Twitter or whatever just see around the crowds at the Astros fans just hearts out of it there were just bombed out people were even leaving\nOr the other night when they were down by a two runs the in the seventh ... ... people were leaving and I understand is because there was a school night it was late the game didn't end until after midnight I understand that part but to the fans who are leaving because they were just merely disheartened to be Frank\nThose fans who left because they were bombed they were down by two and using down by two as an excuse to leave those fans don't deserve a ring\nAnd that's that's a ... that that isn't even a full statement at if you're not going to be behind your team you shouldn't be sitting in those seats supporting your team even if you're down by nine runs bottom of the nice to ask you need to be supporting your team and by large of course Ninety nine point nine percent of astro saying as I Am\nI Am very a lot of respect for Astros fans and a lot of respect for using is becoming such a baseball town\nOr the Texans we're off to a bad start but Houston is shown to sell it to be a wonderful baseball town and now I guess what they've got a taste of what it means to to lose in the postseason so so ... so horribly\nAnd not even hardly they they they gave it their all day it was a very tough ... series all the way to the end I'm just saying I saw a whole lot of fans throwing in the towel while they were still\nIn it do you think part of that is fair weather fans well\nYeah but even the momentum of the team I think that they just seemed like the wind was knocked out of them yeah and I wonder if that was you know something that you mentioned the whole time was the the calls\nYeah and I wasn't sure there's humidity game yeah yes\nAnd that that goes along with what I was saying is welcome to the post season again a Houston Astros we've been I Know they've been the host he's in a few times in the past but I think one of the ashes major problems was rolling into this postseason\nExpecting to go back to back fully underestimating or is the ability of the rest of us who have been who are who are the modern dynasty I don't think they realize the Astros realize that winning it again\nThe second time back to back is almost impossible versus winning is that first time especially you know what in this case especially because they were up against the red Sox again might be a new rivalry but they were up against the red Sox again and it's like they forgot\nRed Sox they know us this is almost the exact same team as last year they know everything to expect from us now\nSo I think they kind of arrows rolled into it on estimating that factor into too much swagger they talked about a lot of swagger this uh this postseason with the Astros especially uh\nI think Redmond was leading the way with all of a swagger he got real quiet he got real quiet and in the past few games\nAnd I think it kind of a whole it to the wind out of the sales have but that's all I'm getting at is it shouldn't have taken the wind out of the sales as soon as Nashville's got down by a runner too it was like the dog out was dead well we didn't expect this what better bring it in\nHas been never settle and so if you're playing every game\nTo to that level\nYou're gonna burn out by the end especially when you've met a team like the red Sox\nI say I wouldn't yeah they could have burned out you're right and never settle I honestly I think it all boils down to [noise]\nUm\nYeah they burned they burned out because they weren't expecting such resistance ... we've been here before we have the red Sox before\nAnd I of course I'm sure they were ready for a fight but I think in the end they kinda underestimated and they let it going down a\nRunner to even going down by four runs get them get the best of them and you can't do that we'll be right back with more gay therapy radio a quick minute here for out east central Houston on the way out\nAudi central Houston you or it is

cute little boy not where you are\nSimultaneous gosh man and a little boy at the same time we talked about this on a previous show [noise]\nWhatever I'm\nSpeaking of little boy a attributes your mom sent me\nHi Suzy sent me of a very lovely letter she found a car with a delorean on it and the ... also has a delorean on it and she said there's no way I could have I couldn't buy this and write you a letter on and so she did and it was very sweet\nAbout basically welcoming me to the family and stuff and she is so happy and I won't get way too many details 'cause it's private for the air anyways\nBut I thought that it was so sweet and then I got sad because I thought I I Need a ride her a letter back but\nThen I remember he said this is one of the little boy attributes that is held off held over into into adult life is that my handwriting\nIs atrocious atrocious and you would think that a child wrote it yeah and I was sad and fly that that I Can't write letters because no one could read it and then I was thinking\nWhy is that this would be an interesting discussion actually interesting geeky discussion as I was wondering why\nSo why did how did I get into adulthood with such horrible horrible handwriting is the first thing where my mind went wasn't that I was left handed it was that well maybe I'm just a product of\nMy generation which is the oldest millennials you can get apparently while I was born in eighty three apparently the ... which is ridiculous I think you're right at the cut off right out of the cut off but I was off maybe the reason my handwriting\nStagnated to my child like at my child like low level was because typing and computers and emails in in school and everything you do you did\nWas so a reliance on computers and dare I say typewriters because when I was going through middle school and elementary school by the by the time you weren't allowed to type papers for for a while\nThey were required you to do the handwriting but it was also because the Internet in in computers they thought there could be too much cheating you can't you played rising was going to be a massive thing because every type paper looks the same so they ... at the beginning\nBut you couldn't write so many papers there was like you're on the right one paper per class or something like that you definitely couldn't use would compete here when it first when it first came out as a source you still have to go to the library have most of your sources\nUh as as actual textbooks has actual book both books ... books but\nEven then I saw all I'm saying is I thought my handwriting may have stagnated because as soon as I learned to ride we were tired and I didn't have to write so much which is the s\nGoing I don't think the handwriting bad handwriting is a generational problem\nUm they had not they have to right now but I think cursive is that was the biggest yeah a challenge that I heard I I had to learn how to write in ... but then there are schools now that don't teach\nCursive write 'em did moms letter was that written\nAnd goes and curse mostly boss right now let's look at it it was mostly ...\nI think it is that's that's usually and I and I learned I did learn to write\nCursive but I I did wind up is right there I did wind to figure it out why my handwriting was so bad because me at first I thought is that computers no is it because of\nA scapegoat of being left handed no they're almost made a big mess and yeah and it's all my books yeah ... is in cursive\nSo wasn't computers of wasn't being left handed pinpointed why my handwriting was so terrible you just stop you want any\n[laughter] [laughter]\nWhat I think [laughter]\nNo no and you know read it then what motivation to you have to make it better because I was ... I was pretty good at and drawing I at one point I was really good\nAt and drawing and making our in things with my hands I was I was good at that mhm and I was good at doing things with my hands like I I took piano for a few years\nI play guitar I still play guitar so I was good with the dexterity and my hands and doing ... things\nBut\nI'll just tell you you know what I say I think I've been ... to ... you know why wait is because it because of my most developmental like handwriting year years when I was first learning to put a pencil in my hand to write so kindergarten basically to make letters and shapes with my hands\nNobody knew my eyes were horrible and I couldn't see what I was feeling so I think was there's going to blow my whole world of life that I think that I learned in those formative years to my hand to hand to a\nAccommodate for my eyes because not only was crossing my eyes in seeing double lines are right Jay J. O. A. J. C. N. N. N. N. N. slide why because when I stop laughing\nBecause when I bring my eyes together to focus [noise] they would be two lines everything would be in focus but it will be double everything so I Would never\nWant my muscles were learning how to make all them shapes all them shapes\nHere's that accent [laughter] that's just dumb that wasn't an accent that was just Saudi ...\nAll of them of mom maybe when I was wearing a make them shaves learning how to work my muscles yeah [noise] that's why I picked up the eternal bad habits like my brain made that connection like permanent connection my ... in my mind that this is just the way\nMy answer going to move so to compensate for that reason what do you think\nI think that you know that is an interesting theory theory yes um however\nHow long have you been writing that's not see you could have adjusted your writing when you got a class is even into adulthood practicing your letters say that they are legible [noise]\nYeah and I'm sure there's probably people listening who are actual development of teachers are just like yeah Johnny are just lazy you just you learn you got the basics of what you needed to do and then he did what any more effort into\nVery good handwriting muscle memory but in order to improve that you have to practice just like anything else when I did like I I I practice as much as\nPractice writing in the next duty even into adulthood no hell no well [laughter] but I practice good handwriting into adulthood", "show_name": "Geek Therapy", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
