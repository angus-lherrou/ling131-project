I'd have words but again secret services involved and weren't going to get near the guy yadda yadda yadda\nBut it would be nice if you could just address it anyways it's it was such a good ad and it was so simple and well done\nBut then came out and said that he doesn't like tax\n[laughter]\nIt was a you know it was unfortunate to say that I wouldn't go records said he's a nice guy who better yeah I've never met him like he's cool he's nice you know like he believes and what he's doing sure\nBut it's sort of one of those things where it's like so it was Ted Cruz though you've got to his fans are annoying his fans are really annoying but so are the hard like if you really like a band but then you're just like I don't want to go to the concert because we don't want to see the ... but I I think it's that way everywhere mhm everybody's\nSpans are annoying everyone's super fans are annoying yeah\nLike\nGeorge Springer super fans are unknown J J what super fans are annoying\nMhm I don't they're annoying as they are around ... oh you said that not in a local journalist apologizes for true to comment on one show it's true or or yeah or like because like I cannot go to bed or rallies like it's it's against my\nMy religion as a reporter sure like I'm not supposed to do that kind of ...

let me tell you as if I ... no she don't want to experience any sort of malfunction when you are strapped to a rocket\n[noise] so just imagine you are one of the those astronauts and ... they're on a Soyuz rocket and you experience they quote unquote a booster malfunction\nSo here's what happened there was a booster malfunction or I don't know exactly what happened is just fake booster malfunction I think I've read somewhere that it could have been a a failure to separate something happened during the separation of the boosters and the\nAnd whatever the second stage is there's a malfunction at that point I Believe\nAt any rate\nIt made the cosmonauts an astronaut initiate an emergency abort resulting in a steep but potentially potentially potentially deadly dissent back to earth [noise]\nIt
