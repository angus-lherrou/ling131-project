forever yeah but the other cool thing is that all the people that voted for Bayh though\nWould\nFigure out that he doesn't run the state\nYeah we're talking about this week's ago he's not the governor right and it's it's a habit that does those things correct in his people correct so ...\nAs much as senator can do a lot sooner does a lot of things it's a it's a really you know it's an important job we need these yes but he's not going to be able to do things on a molecular level like they want right and when you tell people that\nThey yell at you and call you the devil and say where's\nYour make America great again hat and why do you hate me ... doesn't want me to pay high college tuition\nBut who's going to pay for it who he can't he can't take\nThat away that it's not in charge of that no just like Obama was in charge of that no no\nIt's a somebody said this past week that it's sort of like the class president like if somebody is running for class president and by God we're going to have pizza every Monday to friday not just for pizza friday but pizza Monday to because we know Monday is a bad day we're not even have it any homework anymore because ... stupid\nRight that kind of thing right and they can never prove Dennis Miller once had a bit and the bit went like\nThis Miller was very unsung was ahead of the title learned a lot from him and I still do on his Twitter it's really funny\nHe had a bit once and he said that once you get elected president they sit you in a room and they go\nCongratulations ... has no was it bill Hicks had a thing where like you would advise ugly you walk he basically you walk in we can find it probably knows that for what is it bill Hicks or wasn't ... say the thing we basically and I have to use it act like I'm smoking a cigarette because that's how bill Hicks was ensure you walk in after your elected president and you ...\nOf like all these crazy ideas among these things are going to do and then you walk into a room and there's a guy shadowy guy in the corner and they hand you a folder he goes okay you want to do what now\nAnd you go oh man I'm going to do this ... this and we're going to legalize this and everything's going to happen this way\nI mean it was alright roll tape they didn't like hey roll tape of every like horrible thing that's happened over the past like two hundred years in America in the background story and why this had to happen and why we had to do this when he goes All right so what now what you want to do is like\nIt's the same joke you know the exact joke that I was thinking was that you get in the oval office you sit down they congratulate you they pass you on the head and they have jewel folder\nYeah when you open the folder it shows you exactly what state of a raid is dead at that point in time\nVersus what you thought it was in yeah because you'd never do the worse yeah exactly it's always worse so right that is there a secret service member watchers your entire psyche just crumble\n[laughter] gone it's like it's like a route\nFrom The Simpsons when when he leaves it doesn't\nLike it that way and he just said no air and then and then\nYou emerge from the White House yeah and you waved to the people knowing full well there you go back to the Gulf that the only way I see how they're going to have is golf because\nAs soon as you go back into that house it is yeah may hamper sucks again exactly that's why presidents golf and leave all the time basically ... to that job that you hate yeah\nYou're like oh God I got to go back to all got out of the time to ask the days be right\nBack so I always try to say that a lot of work it either\nUh yeah but I'm excited that Trump's going because I like Marty excited about the the insanity in the ... of the city at that point because you can have people who are going to be complaining about traffic well the cops will be stopped on the side of the free out\nThere you have that you're going to have great because you don't know trucks coming in ten because half the people don't pay attention they're all gonna stop here there's a copier ... he's not tracking you yeah he's not he's not going to pull you over and\nSo you're going to have like you know the supporters and you're going to have you know the people out there who are going to protest because\nThat's their right they can do that but it's kind of like well what's going to do exactly um but yeah for me him and I like how this week they were people were making fun of him\nBecause he has to go to energy arena after he had promised that he was going to get the biggest stadium in Texas for this thing Dallas steady yeah\nOr the other is Kyle Kyle Field would have been bigger oh instead of a few in the yard yeah Eighteen the not Dallas so and I think Eighteen she can is eight is eighty thousand but they can convert it to one hundred thousand like they did for the super bowl\nBecause you can get ... people on the field yeah or something they can they can convert something in the ... field is has a pretty big thing but\nWhat I tried to break it down to people that it's also\nSo yeah we can make fun of him because he said he he we he over shot his coverage right if he was never going to get something that big\nOr he could just now legally be looking at it from a from a an ethical standpoint versus a logistical standpoint of there is no way we could do this is the president United States\nYou can't have him in a big giant open air thing I'd like to not it'd be a nightmare yeah especially for a stop that's going to take maybe an hour maybe he may be here for an hour\nOr so I mean there was like there's those kind of logistics also he said this in August which is like two men two months out of two months out so you can't
