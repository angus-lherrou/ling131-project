been handed to you I don't buy it um ... the Texas for years he was squeezed insurance companies in Hamburg them for thousands of clients\nJust like you belong to the Texas I made an offer and that's what the law says\nGoing back to the radio I'm your mental curator Johnny hamburger and I don't have a lot of time\nTo waste in this segment because it's all pre determined free time radio segments that's the way this works earlier in the week I threw apple under the bus for their written Dickie ...\nWith consumers they charge top dollar and then they put things out that are broken or that don't perform or don't give you what you're paying\nFor which is top dollar that's what you're paying for these devices so anybody who does that\nDeserves to get thrown under the bus if they don't provide consumers what they want some Microsoft I'm throwing you under every single tire of that bus now this is unbiased and has to be it's not just to be fair because I threw out on the bus is because you to Microsoft are being stupid in the case of the surfaces so let's get into it\nAh the surface go I actually don't have much of a problem here but get the hundred and twenty a gigabyte model that makes the most sense it also has eight gigabytes of ram and it cost a starts at five hundred and fifty dollars\nIt does have us be see but it doesn't have ... three ... which makes sense because the pentium forty four Fifteen why is under powered for anything you'd probably used honorable three four but it at least has type seat at five hundred fifty dollars is the cheapest surface but it has type see that's going to be important going forward here let's move on\nOh Microsoft the surface to surface to surface pro six starts at eight Ninety nine and goes up to about twenty three hundred dollars twenty two Ninety nine\nA comes with the with an eye seven likely a whiskey like eighty five sixty five you twenty five watts four course a threads up to four point six gig or hurts sixteen gigabytes of rambling tear abide SST those are drool where the ... so far\nUh but there's a catch no matter what speck and despite a more than adequate CPU choice you don't get ... three\nAnd you do not even get a USB seaport\nWhich is mind boggling for paying a premium price up to twenty three hundred dollars you don't even get the type seaport that the surface go gets at five hundred and fifty you get a full type a full sized type a port okay that's nice I'm not arguing that\nAs long as you also have a type see on the same device to my knowledge not even the proprietary duck will support ... three\nSo no ball or status you can't carry around your surface pro six all day long and then plug in your ah ... three external gp you enclosure to game with\nCan't do that even though you spent twenty three hundred dollars Microsoft what are you thinking that's on forgivable stupid really\nA moving onto the surface laptop to it starts at nine hundred Ninety nine dollars and goes up to Twenty one Ninety nine because you only get up to five twelve gigabyte us all stay drive so it's the same specs as the surface pro six and a you might be thinking oh well it's a laptop surely will have type seeing thunder bolt\nNope you are wrong it is natural to think that a laptop whatever type seeing thunder bolt now this does not\nMoving on ridiculous\nSurface book to this is not really important for this argument other than you can spend less elsewhere to get more out of service spoke to does come with the G ... sixty and at least in eighth Jen I seven so I'll forgive that it doesn't have ... three because I Would personally used honorable three most of the time\nFor an external GB you enclosure but since it already put since the service book to include the ten sixty to extend sixty\nI don't really need an external GPA or for that\nLet's move on to the the ...\nMicrosoft's disrespect for the consumer the surface studio to this is the main event of Microsoft Microsoft apple ask spite\nFor consumers requests requirements and most importantly wallets [noise] it starts at thirty four Ninety nine and goes up to forty seven Ninety nine\nSo about fourteen hundred dollars all of them have an eye seven which actually is the worst thing about\nThe studio to you all get to on a second uh the price goes up as you add ram and storage of course to thirty two gigabytes of ram into terabytes respectively and on the ... side\nUp to a G. T. X. ten Seventy which is also down slightly less dumb but I'll explain why it's dumb and I'm On it in a moment and keep in mind you can spend up to forty eight hundred dollars for this [noise]\nAh we still don't know if at least the most expensive a surface product will have thunder bolt three Microsoft has not said yet whether it has ... three are not\nAh which makes me believe leads me to believe that it does not because why would they announced that they're most expensive surface still doesn't have thunder both three or right before launch and cripple their pre order sales\nThat's probably why doesn't have to undergo three 'cause they know if they say it it'll hurts they say it doesn't it will hurt hurt sales are now the ... the meat and potatoes\nThunder both three or not it still doesn't change the fact that they are charging top dollar up to forty eight hundred dollars within earshot of I'm pro money which is five grand for Ninety Ninety nine and then at night for a price that will uh\nThat wild better than the previous studio still uses a previous generation processor a seven thousand series I seven and nearly previous generation gp you and not even a G. T. X. ten eighty max queue at that point a it's a ten Seventy\nSo that nearly previous generation gp you argument leads me to my main request for Microsoft just you know beyond the inclusion of ... three which they don't have to even going into twenty Nineteen and I'll explain why they don't have to undergo three in a second because it is baffling stupid\nBut back to my plea for Microsoft my request for Microsoft which is this\nFor the next slush wait for all the current generation opponent components to be made available within reason of course for instance the last studio had a nine hundred serious G. P. U. N. video jeep you while the one thousand series was available why did you put an old generation gp you and then when you could have put a or the current generation\nOr so in the studio twos case you could have waited just a little bit longer if you would have waited just a little bit longer for and video to offer up to two thousand the mobile two thousand series are ... for years\nI Would be much easier it will be much easier for us to swallow forty eight hundred dollars if you're offering us the latest and greatest technology available since you're charging so much\nSo for the love of God don't insult the consumer by asking\nThem to spend the most money you possibly can charge them well ask\nWell offering them last generation sheep CPU in last generation gp is don't do that just wait wait until everything is available the latest and greatest available then offer it to us\nNow listeners\nTurn on your recorders record one about to say because I Will not say this often [noise]\nSo so recording now if given only the choice only the choice between a forty eight hundred dollar surface studio to Henri based model IMAX pro ... pro for New Years makes no difference at this price point two hundred dollars more\nGet the ... did you record that\nDo you make a gift out of that or something like that because I'm not saying that again here's what you were getting for two hundred dollars more on the ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Geek Therapy", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
