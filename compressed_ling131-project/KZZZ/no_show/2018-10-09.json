that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people's jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or\nAny of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not\nA so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about an artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common\nSo they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart\nTruckers see three arena or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's creative can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation\nUnfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools were developing to do very good things like that didn't apply\nCancer or something like that can be used\nAll right cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to trip to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and they get all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technology is but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right\n... run a red light you lose the point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points\nYou write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you go when you don't fly on airplanes anymore you don't um and and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this is governed by laws you have the price of liberty is sort of vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nViolence is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even the Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just said the technology is it a point where\nThey could decipher you know what what was that many people are saying and then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it in the way that human understand something that decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of build up the abstract profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be to do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up code words like bomb ... whatever\nAnd so it finds this\nUh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian\n... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\nWell it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh and now that that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAlright well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll

that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we don't you know earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's we don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if\nIf you are a machine and your

I was saying it's thirty five to forty now within\nThe kill zone this is very winnable this all about you and an agency even the post story today's a little dated 'cause it doesn't really talk about what happened after capital might make what we're going to see is remember President Trump won a white female voters fifty two forty eight which done Hillary Clinton\nHe won a high school educated white voters voters sixty nine\nThirty one ... President Trump does resonate with women who who understand national security and women who are concerned that law and order a women who are concerned about the economy or jobs so I think we have to get those female voters out and I think they will come out I I Love it looked at\nAnd and people have to understand if we stop the blue what\nThe Democrats are going to turn on each other in a vicious way between the Clinton Wall Street hunter and these kind of social justice a base of cultural marks on the left tear each other apart and I think lead us to a massive victory in two thousand twenty that's where it such urgency\nFor people really the focus on his house districts in the in the coming out in the coming three or four weeks that we really this is all about\nYou know one of the great things I Love about being a conservative Republican at all or is that people understand it's about self reliance inspect getting up and doing something this is a hundred percent\nIn our our zone right now to to turn this around I think you can look at every number the trend is that our favor\n... uh I certainly hope so see before we let you go let's talk about what's happening in Europe\nI Know you have the movement it's called uh in Europe uh you've done some marketing Italy we see some Deanie there are and other leaders and kind of saw Lappin was meeting with me any yesterday the day before a\nInto trying to again recapture the European a cultural understanding that it's been so threatened by poor leadership mass migration et cetera and where do things stand in in Europe I Know it's mhm every country's different but where things stand now but\nYou know this kind of populist nationalist revolt a ... year ahead of where we are on the United states that's what great it kind of came up before a brags that and the two thousand sixteen victory Donald Trump are inextricably linked you're seeing the same thing and\nIn Europe right now ... basically what it is it's the same kind of Tea Party grassroots revolt you know ... ... evangelical Christian revolted through soon over in Europe what you're saying there's people that want their sovereignty back of their countries are tired of the ... you is really a global ... organization has tried to take their\nTheir national sovereignty and take the value of their citizenship away from that whether it's on migration economics a whole host of\nOther issues and you're seeing leaders like Le Pen in France\nOr the alternative ...

we played it on Fox maybe it was CNN a congressman Gary Monday who also I think they're trying to downplay this\nWhere they were trying to downplay the impeachment after they've seen these polls\nAnd so this congressman cycle that's not why my people in my district are saying they're not saying that they're clamoring for impeachment of Kevin ... see I thought they actually tried to do that because it'll just me and the Republicans will smash\nThem back just smash them back what that Steve ... he was on he said well maybe he's more of a straight shooter he's the host on MSNBC and he's looking at

September seventeenth during the Kevin crush\nThe Trump administration's descending a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies to believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from in may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to the to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward and contentious standoff between Trump and representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one say there\n\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get to lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nBut very few organizers and Congress and I think that organizers operate differently if all different kind of strategy\nAnd what it is really about organized all and I'm really thinking about that word organized people bull strategic an action or we will bring together a\nAnd we played the whole thing because it's funnier can you can you can you using her phrase can we segment some of that James so I can listen to it again maybe I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night was a big night\nNo it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night and we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped\nBrett was there all the justices were there everybody was there who you know who who really was instrumental in helping the nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody or maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the\nBrilliant and incisive logic of costs you ...\nWell I think a lot of your children are strategy around got her hand you know there's a lot of hype baseball and inside the beltway ... say that term thrown around\n...\nOkay these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategies inside baseball\nI'm a forgive me but she at least what I've heard she seems like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person she got people to go out and vote vote for probably a nice person I don't understand what you're saying\nWe need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nHow it has to be like\nAll abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalize drugs pot all\nAll of it has to be ... sit on the American people [noise] so like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are very ... organizers will Congress and I think that or the loggers operate differently if for some kind of strategy\nYeah they they're they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme Court big brass door\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last night on the angle every time I ticked off at Trump agenda item winning agenda item every time I did that\nWe played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more on happy they are\nBut the ... I just found that to be a scream by the way they are a lot of different angles that people got with their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy looks like he's wearing skinny\nJeans he's banging then you go you see the woman there's like this this liberal woman who's like trying to pry open each these doors I've\nWalked in them enough times I Know these doors probably way their their ceremonial doors they probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant\nClawing at the door is trying to open them\nThis is kind of a metaphor though isn't it for what they're they're trying to their clawing and banging at the more traditional understanding of America [laughter]\nShut America down this shutting the traditional understanding of America down about ... and then they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court ... court is going to go on and heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on\nBut it's about shutting down you your voice intimidating you so you got your back in the corner of an elevator it's about shutting down this idea of traditional families\nIt's about shutting out the idea of understanding of American history shut it down pulling statues down with ropes in the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they become\nAnd its public schools it's private schools and colleges it's indoctrination it's the mass migration of the country of people who are here illegally who are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history to understand why this\nIndoctrination it's the mass migration of the country of people who are here illegally\nWho are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history\nTo understand why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to founded this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic\nIn the term rent tremendous sacrifice of our framers the original are signatories of our constitution great sacrifices they made\nBut if you don't understand any of that then\nYou kinda just arrived here in America is yeah it's it can make money here boy this is so great can make money\nIn China make money and you know Qatar and make money a lot of places and why this place so great why is it why is it special so we can see what we saw over the weekend protesters\nFine ... the protest is is is welcome under our First Amendment I'm Talking about the way you protest the weather is dignified or undignified\nNow we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic non violent classy way of protesting this is a ... approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far\nI think that if the rules that there are a lot of people who are very very much ah I'm motivated but what is going on for ... because ... and all that and this was a canoe for us in our country\nShe went to the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez school of logic apparently or her on her own uh went to hers or a ... I went to her own knows I Can't tell which\nSo in other words Mazie Hirono God help you in Hawaii Mazie Hirono wants more of this people people are upset\nThat I keep saying that but I'm going to say it again imagine if conservative activists\nCornered Kamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered in an elevator with conservatives pointing and screaming at her and she's she's backed up into the corner of an elevator imagine what they would say what about the life what do\nThey say it was anti women it was an timid hating it was harassment\nThey would claim that all Republicans who didn't announce that type of\nOf a a behavior and conduct that you were anti women and it would be a thousand percent Trump's fault it would be oh don't you think you'll be all Trump's fault in this case why don't we hold Democrat leaders responsible for these type of protest they should be held responsible they're not condemning it\nAnd and they have their moment where they said well maybe Maxine Waters went a little too far that lasted for like five milliseconds but they hold Trump responsible for Charlottesville\nI say they're responsible the Democrat leadership are responsible for the less the is running the asylum in these protests\nIn chief and all of it\nEight five five forty Laura will take a break a lot more to get to Nikki Haley resigns as the UN

about forty five percent less an hour\n[laughter] I didn't even hear how Mrs yesterday I I've never like Taylor Swift music you know what I really don't like is that Taylor Swift ruined watch ill Rhode Island\nWhere I used to go as a kid she took on an old home that was up on this a bluff that was just an old colonial home it was it was largely in when I was a kid it looked giant and of course she tricked it all out she has these these guards standing on the rocks all\nAround her her state looking down on the public beach and they and you if you even so much put a pinkie toll on the rock the guard start talk you know started telling you to get your foot off the rock you know what I\nYou know what I said to one of them I said this is a couple of years ago now I said\nShe really paying you that much money that you stand out here all day long and tell these the beachgoers who are just trying to go with their family that the little boy or girl can't climb on the rock\nReally and the guard just seemed really miserable by the way\nI was just going to say she endorsed Phil Bredesen which I Hope I I guess she hasn't heard that Phil ... said that he would have voted for cash voter Kavanaugh so what's she talking about [noise]\nAnd when you're when you're most famous song is called shake it off okay then you really that's all you need to know about Taylor Swift I mean I she's incredible marketing genius and\nI think he just made a um [noise] pays for it or something\nShe is so tall\nBut I mean this is what Katy Perry thought she was going to\nDo and all they all thought

to the White House doors are ... they they seem to be truly upset\nAre ... they they seem to be truly upset that things are going well in the country\n\nWell it's interesting I mean you know it it it's in saying oh well there's a couple of things that are funny my wife works where the progressive woman and at some point\nDon't know bill Mars name came up and maybe he was going to retire or something like that and she uh now wait a minute he's like the only one on our side and I thought\nYeah Bill Maher and everyone on late night and all the news outlets and MSNBC and CNN it's it's weird that hey it it's it's funny to have simultaneously almost everyone in the news you and\nHannity and Tucker at a handful of other people excluded or the exception but\nAlmost everyone's on your side and you're claiming we have no voices on our side\nIt's interesting and then also here's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young twenty five I mean you know thirty five and ... one one of the guys who worked with me who's an intelligent enough guy\nSays to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't\nGet it why don't we just why didn't they just get rid of him and get another guy and get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the past and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record it move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like\nYou don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage all this stuff but got hooked up at the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school they're going through in your book I said what do you think they would do to that guy but he literally thought\nWell just get a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake everyone moves forward\nI think that any other president would have\nProbably drop Kavanaugh um any other animals I think of the guys who ran against Trump in the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them would have stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was something you could not backed down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam that when we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC and NBC and that's where he gets his information and he legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with Kavanaugh mhm and\nThat's to me where the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all the information and it's all going through the filter\nAnd so ... what choice but draw these conclusions he could no he couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right or at least an objective kind of understanding okay this this is Kevin honest opinion zero three hundred ... he was a Bush guys in the Bush White House for seven years\nWas Justice Kennedy's Locklear come and it's not some fire breathing person going to burn down to the Supreme Court's got yeah but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating the discussion Adam to the point that people are afraid to speak out and now those images and those video clips\nOf people like Susan Collins been cornered with her back against the law and the elevator I I mean I think they would have to walk through that crowd on Saturday I don't know if she would have survived it\nFrankly\nYou know it's interesting because I grew up around it I grew up in the seventies I had a kind of a hippie mom and it's so funny because when you think of ... hippie or progressive no one says hippie anymore but\nSort of progressive sort of tree hugger piece lover I'm going to take my daisy and I'm going to put it in a barrel of the garden\nOf the national guardsmen just but nice that been near is rage it's so funny it's almost an application to hide the rage the hippies were some of the most angry people I've ever met when I was a kid I figured this one out\nMy mom was kind of a hippie but she was also kind of rage fall and I think it's a compensation for the anger that's in them\nYou know a picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie O'Donnell\nA picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie odonnell with the ... cutie but Judy Chubb club member her daily\nTV show from the nineties was there ever a more ... sweet character ever she's up there to big fluffy sweaters that she's laughing at\nThat was a over compensation for the rage full Rosie O'Donnell and I think all the free to be you and me tree hugging a three lovers\nI think there's rage and it's funny because they've always painted the rights is the angry war mongers course so Rachel but look at all the rage on the left\nThere there again their anger is completely\nDisconnected from the overall mood of the country as well as long I mean literally had Hillary in there and we had seven percent unemployment and interest rates were going up and\nWe were in Syria and I'm more military ... ... ... more military in Syria Adam ... that'd be fine as long as their their social construct as being foisted upon the American public they their their happiness political happiness exists only as America is being transformed in their direction\n\nYes it's true it's it's a kind of an adolescent approached life if you're in your room and you have your toys who cares if the whole neighborhood is crumbling as long as you're occupied with what you what are your watching what you want to continue be sort of a ... with immediate gratification\nSo yes it's true listen I live in Los Angeles I I I get it\nBut I ... you have to step over piles of homeless people we're gonna have a ... a epidemic coming any day now because uh the homeless people are getting the fleas from the rats I mean it is it started with your more it here but as long as uh the folks in power keep their power\nUh they're they're happy now the rage roll again against Trump don't get me wrong but we have I live in one of the worst run cities in the in the country\nYeah well again [laughter] and I'm Carl is with us here on the ... show I have to play something for your ... and then we'll let you close it out and and this was Hillary I'm being interviewed about you know the state of things in America today let's ...\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win that the ... that's ... ... ... started down\nAt him\nYou know these are the people who kick you in the share and and\nThen you push 'em in the shoulder and they go why did you push ...\nIt it's unclear\nI Do feel it kinda makes you feel like you're taking crazy pills right mhm and also basically what she's saying is what you just said which is as soon as we get our way and will stop during a tantrum\nAnd then civility we'll we'll set in a also this notion I I I I have to go to a quick rant here this notion of\nI Would like to destroy the environment so that my kids all live underground for their adult lives like I hate women or even though I have a daughter and in a wide\nI hate people that look different than me or\nI hate gay people it is one of the most in Seoul thing people never really think about how in Seoul thing it is I mean it's wrong but calling everyone a racist and everyone massages everyone homophobic and the republic\nIt's wildly insulting to those of us are just raise their families and pay their taxes or walk their dogs\nWell that is such a great way of putting it and I think again that feeling of being insulted and kind of kicked to the curb or demeaned\nThe into a building or a metal topped vehicle to learn more visit lightning said he got an L.

Smith for sixty two yard touchdown\nSo one of the great NFL stories barely over six feet coming out of Perdue fell to the second round\nWas with the chargers that all the sort of a sudden he got injured with the chargers chargers decided to go with Philip Rivers and then Drew Brees nearly signed with the Miami Dolphins in imagining how he could have changed his history if they had decided to go with Drew Brees instead of Dante colpepper\nBecause they were concerned about his shoulder separated shoulder with the chargers are and then all of a sudden\nNick Saban is with the dolphins I Wonder if Nick Saban would still be coaching the dolphins of Drew Brees was his quarterback or\nMaybe it would have gone to another college after a you know the NFL but\nDrew Brees going to New Orleans what he meant to that city that community winning a Super Bowl I'm a pretty impressive performance or we can celebrate the record with Drew Brees congratulations for him any pilot he got into prime time\nYou know I I think a lot of what we think what Drew Brees as you go on trial Drew Brees he's he's one of those oh that's right Drew Brees you always think of Brady you always think Aaron Rodgers Ben Roethlisberger and then you go on trial Drew Brees\nHe's bad guy but\nYou got forty one miles of passing yards by Drew Brees I Know with the the officers now what you can't do on defense we expect everybody to throw for three hundred yards but he's been doing it for Fifteen Years now\nThey're even before they change these rules even before they made it almost embarrassingly easy to throw for three hundred yards can you check make love and I do believe Drew Brees is completing about Seventy five percent of his parents his bully\nHe's at Seventy seven point nine right now leading the NFL he also led the NFL ... completion percentage last year at Seventy two percent\nWhich will be amazing it used to be a few completed sixty percent like that was hall of fame stuff used to be if you through for three hundred yards that's hall of fame stuff now know hey you got three you only got three hundred huh\nYeah I like what do you remember when quarterbacks you get old to back in the day I Know but ... the way he plays can play like this I Would think a high level for two or three years here is the question I have for as long as Sean Payton gets along with the front office with the saints you've got breeze and you got his guy paid man\nOr a a show on paper but what happens if Sean Payton decides hey that Dallas job might be open maybe I'll go there\nDallas job might be open maybe all go there\nWhat about if the jets were to open up\nWith Sean Payton then go there [noise] just throw it out there you know they got a Superbowl caliber team in my opinion but you know you got those two are joined it they have\nThey been together\nA how long have they been together compared to rock was burger Tom on obviously Brady embellish jak is there anybody else on that list Rogers and McCarthy but I'd I'd have to think the breeze and then Sean Payton have been together\nSecond on that list make love and\nI'd have to check and so I think the question who started the most touchdowns away the coach obviously ... Brady won and yeah and I'll ... I'll see if we find that\nI think I think breeze and Sean Payton uh been together for twelve years polling since\nI was six they started together you know sex with the things\nI'm also looking at the numbers here and and I don't know what these are going going to mean because bandage thirty six Philip Rivers is thirty six and they're very similar in their yard age fifty two thousand for Ben fifty one thousand for Philip Rivers\nI'm Matt Ryan is thirty three and he's at forty three thousand Aaron Rodgers is thirty four with forty thousand\nA Joe Flaco thirty seven so I'm trying to figure Matthew Stafford is probably the guy to keep an eye on and I believe Matthew Shepard will join us on the program tomorrow so we can talk to him about this but he's thirty with thirty six thousand so if you do the math here\nProbably at this pace round thirty eight thirty nine Matthew Stafford would be up around Seventy two thousand but I don't know what breeds is going to put up\nWell let's say he has this season into more season so we got eighty thousand yards with him\nHe's going to be over five hundred in probably five hundred and fifty touchdown passes like it's all said and done but he's he is an afterthought he's the guy that if he had another Super Bowl I\nThink it would change how history will view him dramatically 'cause if Rogers gets another one he's still Aaron Rodgers rating still Brady\nBan maybe a little bit would change if you got another Super Bowl but it feels like if if Drew Brees got a second one and had all those passing numbers than it feels like he moves up considerably certainly a top five quarterback of all time yeah apple\nAlso ... gets a second one and he's directly responsible for it not like a last you know Peyton is last no offense to paint manning but he kind of look to the finish she still got the second ring but in the direct comparison of the two yard as kings Drew Brees can be above par with two Super Bowls and above manning with too strong one but it still feels like\nFootball historians the writers would look at Peyton Manning as a better quarterback no certainly more impactful and one of the blue blood quarterbacks he fits the role but\nDrew Brees is going to have everything that you want in a quarterback\nAnd then so yes see but how much this Peyton Manning pedigree play into them\nI mean he sort of he came into the league has already the guy and Drew Brees you know I had to do it all and self yeah\nYeah I think that being a blue blood that matters where's Drew Brees has always been a cute little underdog story I it's right there was a guy who says he six feet but not six feet or just passing you know there's always got his head up like this\nThree tours driving Humvees and Afghanistan well here we live in ... when my sister came back from a long string can she didn't want to talk about that she knew I was basically\nSometimes my husband still has difficult memory can be overwhelmed with the veterans crisis line I Know where to turn the corner\nRemain calm and got support from my sister the veterans crisis line is here for all of them and send them a call one eight hundred two seven three to five five and pressed one\n[noise]\nBracing for landfall line Lee summit Sarah Fox news hurricane Michael now a category three taking aim at the Gulf Coast of Florida\nIs not taking the storm lightly and neither should any family stay\nTogether ...

ship\nAnd I get I guess he got yelled at by his wife like how are you letting these boys do it never Tomlin all over the field while the game's going on so I I I'm watching and I want to know what's gonna happen with his sons that's like I'm really interested in that so here's Drew Brees talking to his kids after breaking the record\nA little teaching moment there yeah ... we're all sitting there going on this guy Seventy thousand jars of rang he's Mr New Orleans yeah now he's like in the middle of a a football game he's giving life lessons to kids kids\nWhy did this change could flag for

now feel very mature\nJohn ... and they had a touchdown too which is a clear I Know\n[laughter]\nI'm thinking how are you how are you getting a flying for celebration their spring and the record

didn't even realize we're there for a but there were the situation will answer that [noise]\nYeah we were watching and I go wait they just flag them for a celebration and then the NFL is going to stop the game and have the celebration it felt like it kind of hit you right then I don't know if if it was in that moment but it kind of hey you're going to pass the all time record ear bend you do it what were you thinking\nRight after that\nYou do it and what were you thinking right after that\nI'm just just a flood of emotion or any of my mind this entire week was just on obviously try to stay as focused as possible and just one in the game you know we're going out there and saying very locked in on play the time staying in the moment and just the hard part was that one was\nYou know two hundred one yard so you know so you know maybe it happen sometime in the\nThird quarter and maybe even early fourth quarter something like that um you know expecting it to be a tight game you know the way that\nWe played the reds games last year it was that dramatic game or the chemical in the end but it was tight with the whole way and so you know I\nI just didn't want it to kill the momentum and honestly I'm just so focused on the game in a way to the game and so I think the fact that that it happened when it did you know to me that drive at the end of the second quarter where you know it's on a low touchdowns or adult to credit script or better\nDo the kids do your boys get the day on\nYes they do get the day off actually I don't know if we told their teachers or not\n[laughter] obviously but I I had\n... and yet a teaching moment there and you set the record in your ah you got a teaching moment that you eat with your boys on the sideline\nYou know I I I I always try to get repeats Lawrence um but when we have a lot of fun together um\nYou know they they love sports and and I feel like sports is they're the greatest teacher or when it comes to I'm just life skills and so I'm I'm there's things that I kind of were spread there every night before they go to bed and that was one of those things but\nI'm just a ... very special moment for them to be a part of\nIf I Would have told you in two thousand six hey you know what you're going to be the only time passing leader in NFL history at some point when would you advise\n\nThem and I would have thought you were crazy you know that was back to the time when I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to come back we're play football and as I did though how effective are over the you know I've always been an extremely

first preseason game and at that time I was just hoping that maybe you can start early and I felt some day and um it's just\nIt's been an unbelievable journey thus far I'm here we are Eighteen years
