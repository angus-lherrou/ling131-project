Blau and David First off we appreciate you taking the time to join us after three very close losses to open the year you guys have won three hundred wrote to err on the road in the Big Ten what is the ceiling for this boy there's team\nThere you know I think we uh the last three weeks we were just kind of been happening to our potential especially after the first few weeks are we really felt like we were hurting ourselves\nCentral especially after the first few weeks or we really felt like we were hurting ourselves with penalties and turnover and things that\nUm we weren't doing very well obviously you know it was costs in those games that we knew that if we if we play the way we were coached a replay disciplined if we executed we take care of the football or we could have a good a chance to be in those extra games and now you know\nA this game coming up with a house they you know it's all yeah scores a chance to you know competing shack up against the best\nYou're in your final season on campus how is boiler makers football evolved since you arrive in West Lafayette five years ago\nYeah you do a lot for three years really were\nSome uh some tough times for us and we struggled and um\nYou know it was it was a pretty downtime here for Perdue football and for you know the area that we were in a after last last year a cook from coming in and help them get us to a ball game of winning the ball game with some optimism and then\nWe had high expectations of the season and uh you know now we're we're finally getting on the right track 'em yeah everybody's real optimistic and they should be a producer community should be I'm optimistic and uh especially with coach bomb at the helm and uh some of the young players we have on this team\nBoiler quarterback David Blau our guest David Roth fences top ten in the country and yard edge what's been working for you guys so well under coach brown\nYeah I think I'm a you know the guys I'm going to love for the ones that I overlooked off line then therefore I'm really well and uh they kept me standing up right they gave it given a running back home and that's what it really comes down to those plate\nMakers we've got we've got a you know run them more spectacular a ... and for us as a making some big catches and we've had receiver step up on the outside that and they plan out some bank coverage\nReally tough so um you know we've just been executing and and make a big place and it's really been a helping us\nBe successful on off\nNick ... has left the Ohio State program but these young has stepped in and pain really really good what kind of pain and distress can eat cause you\nYeah we know or their front seven their defense align as good as we've seen a yeah all across the board\nThose guys can play in a safe young are going to be wanting to get after us and and uh try to get in our back building\nHe's incredibly athletic and their entire front you know there comes a line is is a athletic and he looked out there and you see man these are some benefits guys on\n'em so we do we're going to have to execute them block those guys and and uh if we want to have a shot at being successful it's going to start up front with us and and I think our guys will be ready for the challenge\nHow about this Ohio State secondary what are their strengths\nYeah you know they liked the they like to challenge a a a buy a lot of coverage those guys are can get out and play on an island and you know we're gonna have to win those one on one match ups and that's what we've been talking about a week or you know if\nThey're down or come around April personal taken down they're gonna try to\nBring some pressure and then I'm like man coverage behind it and that's an aggressive defense that's an aggressive mindset Greste coaches\nAnd I think I'm more apt to be ready to beat that man coverage that they're real good at a had success and move the ball get first down the score touchdowns\nDavid ... is our guest David it should be a sellout crowd at ... stadium against Ohio State how excited are you guys to play in that prime time home atmosphere\nYeah we're excited about the atmosphere that's for sure we know the crew faithful turned out and have that place rock and we know how safe travels as well as well and then\nUh we're gonna have to score some points I think\nBut I think it's going to come down to what we've had to do last few weeks it's going to come down to us taking care of the ball or defense taking up all the way\nThe official break a fans will grab some today [noise]\n\nIn West Lafayette wrecked Daniel chat brown whether you're both teams have taken the field for new in black\nWith the old gold numbers and trim\nUp top for the tea on a helmet Ohio State and the standard road uniform great than\nWhite top the scarlet trim the silver helmets\nWith the Buckeye leaves the door to the back as we'll have the coin toss momentarily [noise] all time Ohio State eight and Thirteen [noise] read the Thirteen and aided West Lafayette there's a very lopsided margin in the number of games that have been played considering these two teams have been conference rivals for so long [noise]\nThirty five home games in Columbus just Twenty one [noise]\nFor Ohio's for rather prefer do\nWe're Ohio for rather for Perdue\nEver played since two thousand Thirteen when Ohio State came to town and beat up on the boiler makers fifty six to nothing\nBut Jeff romp feels like something going on your urban Meyer certainly knows that he does shed brown as we get the point to us from our official\nEgo is tails Ohio State near the visitor they want as their tail they call the head [noise]\nAnd then as I had Ohio State is going to talk\nMark ... gets the department from the Buckeye State one of the time\nThey do it for their choice because the second half\nJettison linebacker did you always want to be on the on the field first did you have a preference as a player\nI prefer to be on the field person typically the teams that was luckily we're strong offensive team so from the coaching standpoint you put your deepest out they're going to push towards right they talk to you know you got some great deal with is that whatever Myers thinking by happening to win the faucet then differ\nSo Purdue will have the football first we'll see that up and said we'll see the Ohio State defense they were already used to playing without Nick both as well as you can be so that doesn't come as a huge surprise but he's not here they're linebackers have been\nA little bit soft compared to the tradition that they're used to\nWhen it comes to Ohio State at some of the great linebackers they've had over the years\nBeen some criticism of tough Borland middle linebacker he's played with injuries for a lot of this year\nBut a strong safety and I say a prior Jordan fuller will get up and make him play their problem is the big plays they give up\nWhat part of that as it goes so much man to man on the law third outfits waste and\nLive with your quarterback and you're good I Know it's been\nToo many big please give it up for the book I people what part of that is just a product of that system\nSo Ohio State will kick off left to right Jackson ...\nEnron Dale more the freshman now Iran deal more with a four star recruit from Kentucky and Jeff from openly was excited when he signed with Perdue referred to it it's actually as a coup for boiler maker recruiting and then he stepped into that first game against northwestern and set a school record for yards from scrimmage\nWith three hundred and twelve that night Blake ... kick it off\nHe ended up handling all of the place kicking\nDuty last week for Ohio State and there when it gets Minnesota's the buckeyes will kick it off left or right bottleneck in the boiler makers along the far has\nIt'll be more taken a lot about the five more tries to turn the corner runs into a crowd of buckeyes Seventeen yard line and that's where it will take it over first and then after a ten yard return\nAnd we'll see David blowout who did not start the first couple of games the largest single are beat him out and fall camp in a very close battle but he's been a hot quarterback as ... as of late\n... is like hundreds favorite averaging twenty points a game and cut down to and stuff over the last four ballgames for me has been one of the best quarterback for the\nFirst intend for Perdue no one in the backfield with David Blau now DJ Knox will shift into the backfield from the wide receivers bought a late shift\nPlay action and blouse going to throw at first I have right now more along the number\nTwo guy\nHit all the way out of line of credit down again of twenty three candidates jitterbug hard to tackle\nExcellent job I did not recognize the management coverage from the house think people he had to work for the safety of wrong they'll Morris a mismatch going to be every time they were more we've got mismatch\nItself Portland mess made by lake Harris and Mrs will\nAllow gonna throw swing passed around more to the far side he got it up into his hands and its bottled around and he couldn't bring it down if he had gotten that he would have had one on one of the far side with Sean wave Kendall Sheffield was they're closing the coverage is well instead second down\nTo be able to corral that football I don't take a while the computer with a touch them before you got to the corner and after that I was thinking about going to test that got on the sidelines\nThree receivers bunch tight on the right side of the formation ball in the last half second attempt prefer to eat with their own forte laughing to throw it in five minutes let them at all looking for the tight end that strikes\nThe junior can't haul it in and he was covered likely\nBy Pete Wehner the linebacker\nIncomplete and now it's third in San ... where do you\nLive with a little bit behind with that point they wanted us to break it up is tied in\nThe process behind them a lot more to\nProtect us attempt to produce forty six percent on third down for the year Ohio State allows\nThe conversion not only thirty two percent [noise]\nBut it's a third and ten for the boiler makers flogging a facelift here stepping into the throw down the right side of it\n[noise]\n\nSee going down the side of the the boundary
