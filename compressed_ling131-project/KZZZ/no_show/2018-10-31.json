and sometimes from heritage but in general place is the most certain criteria and it is what applies in the United states\nIt will therefore be unnecessary to investigate any other\nThis goes on to a then quote this is the um this is Edward Bates president Lincoln's hurting general way way way can we separate\nThese two ... because the first one is James Madison hard to take it apart and dozens James Madison right now however James Madison I think in this particular case James Madison is is looking at something different\nHe's not looking at the weather you came from Great Britain or not correct he's not talking about people who are coming in trying to drop off to be able to take stuff or or you know or bringing all family am born in the colonies or were you born in Great Britain\nAnd they answered that two ways if you were born here you don't need naturalization however\nYou also have to be born here to be president and that's what they were worried about they were worried about these English coming in ... ... ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in and just saying hey I'm I'm I'm American I'm living here and I'm American so I can vote\nBecause they knew that if all these English people\nYou can vote because they knew that if all these English people came in they would change the country that's why they didn't want a a\nA foreigner as president as well you had to be born here so they were trying to protect it at that time from the English coming in and screwing up the country with a vote which is what we're dealing with now\nI think I agree with that although he thing if you were born here you are you\nDo have correct because it was a ... it was a different time and a different problem yeah and I always say like as much as I Love James Madison I Love the founders I ... it's almost less important what they thought about this particular issue because it was an amendment to the constitution right we are talking about the fourteenth amendment yeah they do\nAnd that's why you have to separate James Madison 'cause that's not constitutional he didn't put that in the constitution was that was put in under Lincoln and and so now go to that because that's a different argument as well\nUm so so this is now a Edward ... is president Lincoln's attorney general\nMess that we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment or the eight incorporates the language in his uh this is a from the article from National Review properly understood of codified an attorney general Bates contemporary understanding this is what he says\nI'm quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United states of alien parents who have never been naturalized are native born citizens of the United states and of course do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship\nIsn't there more that is the end of that quote I thought there was something else to about ... or maybe it was in James Madison that they had come in the proper way or something I I thought I heard that earlier today but the the the Abraham Lincoln thing\nIs just the same remember so way on a constitutional thing because there wasn't the fourteenth amendment yet I Know I mean he's writing it this is this is the beginning of it so\nThe first one is how do we know who are citizen is because it's almost all well it is at that point all immigrants except those who had come over and the Mayflower a or had their relatives come over before and so it was very small number it was mainly immigrants so how do you know who is an American well were you born here\nThat was it that was the question of who's in American at that time because it was mainly\nA you know people from England and they were worried about the English coming in so you're\nBorn here you're a citizen you can serve you can vote starting to get a pretty serious German influx too yes serious\nGerman and they were free to buy that the the second thing is uh with with Lincoln\nHe's trying to solve it different problem he's trying to solve at that point the Democrat literally the Democratic party this is their first attempt before poll taxes\nAnd you know moving the polling place and all of the crap that they did the first thing was oh well you know you're not okay you might be you might\nBe a citizen but your kids to your kids weren't slaves so your kids aren't citizens\nHe's they're trying to say stop it stop it\nWe're talking about the slaves slaves are free their citizens and so are there children\nThat you have to look at the thirteenth fourteenth amendment for what it was talking about and what it was trying to do it was trying to say to the Democrats stop it these are human beings\nAnd they are citizens and it'd be fascinated here and these two sides topics out because it's ... they're both coming from the conservative perspective it's not like you know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust are these are both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't\nMean as I think you're right but sometimes that is because that is definitely what they were intending right was slavery however sometimes you\n... that in the Gulf of there's they're on an unintended but intended consequences where you would you would absorb a larger group to make sure one group is is there is no way the intent is that if you\nCome here from Mexico central and South America that you have a baby and everybody who does that is now instead of theaters Ryan way that there are Russian\nTours now that take you Chinese student Yes sir I hate you to Miami the Russians you know to Miami you stay here for a few weeks you have the baby here your your your child is American citizenship same thing in Hawaii with the Asians\nA ... big in Hawaii but probably also big in California that's not what they were talking about\nThis out at all different problem yeah the the constitution the first ten in the bill of rights those are universal those are gigantic so when somebody says bill of rights well is it in the first ten\nSomebody says bill of rights well is it in the first ten\nBecause the first ten our global\nPretty much with the exception of new ideas are pretty much the the the rest of them are a reef stating of the first one where they had to get very specific and say no dummy women women are part of all men are created equal women can vote\nSame thing with blacks and the thirteenth fourteenth\nAmendment mhm it there there were specific where the\nWhere the amendments are very broad the first ten\nWhat is it made sense for them to think that in Dallas texas United States of America at Parkland Hospital Seventy five percent of the babies born there are born Jew illegals and now they're all citizens no that doesn't make sense to anybody that's what I did definitely all she could read good ideally right not a good idea constitution\n... this is this this is the best phrase and I just I Can't understand how people don't understand that the constitution was not meant to be a suicide pact\nThat's positive or a but that's also a very dangerous free it's like it's I I feel like that the same argument people use with the second amendment\nOh well they would they look I mean that the time they only had these little weapons you know that we're not at all sure they wanted freedom of guns I mean these guys are too big into the brutal and this is not meant to be a suicide power when I'm Talking about suicide pack I mean on the principles\nOn the principles it's not meant to be a suicide pack if we follow these principles you won't have a constitution you won't have America anymore you just won't\nBecause what he is doing it for a hundred years and we still have America I mean doing differently now there was not to the have the baby tourism back in Nineteen hundred\nIt's certainly being exploited at some level right I mean but that does not mean huge it than I Am ... like let's just say we're glad ... ally argument is an argument to amend the constitution right yeah and let's just say if it was their intent was to be getting let's just say it was\nThat we wanted it ... alien students come in and have been dropped babies over here and then they're gonna be anchor babies and they're going to get citizenship let's just say that with their intent I don't think it was but let's just say it was\nIf that was true and and back then people weren't exploding and now people are you have an image on amendments constitution knock you said we now think\nThe problem if you want to change guns don't make some slippery argue has just amended Eighteenth amendment twenty First Amendment and we said you know what we're going to ban all alcohol\nWe did it bad idea twenty First Amendment forget the Eighteenth amendment we need a drink [laughter] right\nYeah and that's the way you're supposed to do it yeah and they don't want to do it that way because it's hard it's hard and they know that it's impossible to make the argument because when you do something that big you actually have to think about it\nAnd that's why the president's not suggesting we have a constitutional amendment he's just doing it and it I thought they were\nBack then that's when we'll be overturned immediately immediately

for people who don't follow a Whitey ... give us the given tell his story\nIt's a it's a long and complicated tale but in a nutshell\nA you know he uh ran south Boston in a neighborhood called ... and over twenty five year period he basically was allowed to kill with impunity as as we later found out he was um\nIn multiple murders over decades and involved in bringing down the mafia or you know with ... with you know be a target we're we're talking\nYeah uh you know with ... with you know be a target\nWhere we're talking to a job earlier and he is the director of why the United states of America versus James J uh vulgar who's the Whitey I'm and I'm I guess what was it that a tractor due to the story why why did you make the film and what did you what attracted you to it and what did you take away from it\nYeah I mean I thought that ah you know\nBolger finally bring being brought to trial because there's there's such a myth about the guy there such folklore [noise] you know in our society unfortunately we tend to glamorize only heros out of criminals\nUp Bolger probably is the greatest example of that so much folklore surrounding him so much hero worship\nUm films that kind of downplay the grizzly side of or the or the aftermath of of what he was responsible for even if it does show the details of how people are killed you know we we celebrate criminals in this society which is which\nIs an odd phenomenon and so the idea that he was being brought back to trial finally to face the music I thought would be a great opportunity there kind of separate fact from fiction and to really understand the crimes that that was my going in assumption\nBut sitting through that trial and witnessing it and getting to know Bolger are in fact I was the only journalist allowed to actually interview him because the defense attorneys basically trusted me versus some other journalists in part because of my previous worn films like Paradise Lost\nUm uh you know what\nFascinated me and ... and what my big turn was was just how ... the government has been in allowing a killer to run roughshod over the streets of Boston\nAnd how you know he is informant you know if you're going to allow somebody to evade justice for twenty five years you would hope that the record of\nWhat you got what he what you got out so rock solid so points to like\nOh my God this guy was invaluable but I ... the evidence was just not there for me you know he was it was in it he was in the logbook says as being an informant but you know if you really drill into it there's very little information ... that the feds didn't already have it so then the question is why was he allowed\nAnd even if he gave the best information on the planet and is directly responsible for the end of the mafia in New England as we know it which was not the case um ... you still have to question the wisdom of the government allowing somebody like that to commit murder and they knew it\nJoe ...

I like to read a quote from them on that but uh the the the the gist of the idea was\nIs that he would not trade it out\nThat he would not try to out a which they compete his um other competitors with pricing he would out compete them with service and that's one of the things that I noticed right off the bat\nAnd they provide a service and I know there are new to this town\nBut they're not new to the countries are obviously been in since Nineteen sixty they\nAre I think this year they open their one thousand store was in Phoenix and have some time in um this year actually got some time uh I think June or July\nSo I Believe the Bullhead store might be like one thousand and one and a check your receipts yeah check the receipts could be and um so but one of the services that they provide that are most people don't know they do or is that anybody whether you are driving on\nA discount tire company tires if you're bought them at Costco if you bought 'em at Walmart if you bought 'em at big oh if you bought 'em at runs tire superior to any of the ... companies in town\nAnytime you want you can thrive in to discount tire and they have a person that set aside his his his sole job each day is to be there to check tire pressures on anybody's car\nFrom it is a little old fashioned yeah the drugs are much does he have a little paper hacked to I mean I I like the fifties ... it's not a bad idea\nBut uh I haven't noticed in the house but the one thing that I had my over the weekend I had my tires rotated and balance that the discount tire store in Scottsdale and while I was sitting there waiting for my tires to be service um\nI looked out and there was probably seven cars in line and as each car pulled out at least one or two pulled in and so when I left there there was at least ten and again it's a free service anybody can stop in and um and a half their tires check which\nI'm told is one of the uh\nBig moves that big mistakes that people make with their tires is air pressure you know they're either over inflated under inflated\nThe up the ... on Monday you might even reiterated this coming Monday you can always find that number in your owner's manual for your vehicle\nYeah and so uh and then the um [noise] ah so you know that that sort of they provide also ah you know\nWhen you purchase a tire from them that comes with a warranty unlike other warranties ah and if you have a problem with your tire any or whether it's one year two years with three or whatever if there's something wrong with the tires not like a one year Ninety Days would ever want to bring it back and they fix it or replace it\nAnd it was a manufacturer error or anything that happened well I'm not I'm not lead\nBrian explain that to us or in detail but I Know that you get these they give you a certificate with every tire that you buy and you just ended it registered inside their computer and you just show up at any discount tire store in the country and they we replace it a repair\nLittle manila folder with a certificate of authenticity for each of the four tires\nYeah you know just go back to a little bit of history um\nWe talked about the fact that it was started in Nineteen sixty basically\nA out of the old plumbing building as this is the story goes\nAnd he started with six tires that says that was his inventory he had six new tires he had a couple of a reach reds and I think four wheels and it took him three days before he sold his first tier but um [noise]\nUh that was the beginning of it and um [noise] uh they grew into two hundred stores by Nineteen Ninety\nThere five hundred store was in two thousand to seeing just see how quickly that's a that's growing\nA and here's the actual date September tenth two thousand Eighteen they open the one thousand store in uh Phoenix, Arizona no kidding and so I Believe that we have a good chance of being stored number one thousand one\nAnd check your receipt staff um the other thing too is that um\nAs you mentioned earlier um the the philosophy of Bruce and and I and I mentioned to you I met him he was very well respected in the or\nA community of very philanthropic I think I pronounce that right yes by charities and so forth um but he said that he understood that for a company to excel in a commodity market\nThe product differential was a non starter he believed that improving the customer experience could greatly improve the brand value and the obvious it's worked he does say that his success is\nAnd for him to be successful employees or you know have their front line\nIt requires a rigorous training program for everyone I bring eyes\nHe does say that his success is\nAnd are for him to be successful employees or you know have their the front line so it requires a rigorous training program for everyone I bring eyes or so and I read just a tad of this you know the company builds up on his philosophy around its employees rather than its customers\nAs he saw happening employee makes actually happy customers not the other way around and\nThis is the other thing uh when you when you visit these stores these their assistance or the people who are assisting you are so professional and the one thing he uh that Bruce was quoted in famous for saying was that um that everyone in his company had an unbreakable contract\nTo pay for it to the next customer and the next employee and the next generation great service\nFor this reason how he promised to his employees you do a good job in all provide a life long opportunity for you at this at this um a company and the that promise has resulted in strict pro promote from with in\nModel for the employees and I can just said from personal experience that's what I found\nThat's a bit of a grandiose promise to be able to say about it I'll provide you a lifelong opportunity if those company if they'd been open since Nineteen sixty so I guess the man was right\nWell you know the one thing or you may or may not remember this okay they they're a discount tier is in the um [noise] uh what would you call it during the Guinness Book of world records\nBefore I'm Sorry what for their end those Guinness Book of world records for the longest running TV commercial continuous running of a TV commercial and you may or may not remember this but it's for a lot of listeners will remember those at\nIt's a it the announcer says if at any time you're unhappy with one of our tires\nPlease feel free to bring it back and at that moment\nA little old lady with the little person a little hat walks up and throws a tire through the front window of the store and the announcer says thank you and that ad caught on and uh and has been continuously running\nOr to make it to the point where it's in the Guinness Book of world records for the longest running\nTV commercial do you remember that by chance\nNo but I'm just imagining the old woman as a ... so I'm sure I'd probably haven't seen in the last ten years\nWell it's pretty funny commercial to get a chance to see it you know the other thing too um they um\nA discount tire you may do you ever watch NASCAR I haven't seen it in a while either\nWell on that see a discount tire sponsors a couple of cars they sponsor um [noise]\nUh the number to forward or in the uh NASCAR cup series I I've seen that was one of the four tires yeah the last four tires discount tires oh and um they and they also sponsor the number twenty to forward in the NASCAR expanding the series for teen Pinsky\nAnd they also sponsor the monster energy am a super cross I have no idea what that is if the tire mobile that's not a car it's a thing where I'm going I'm ... I'm going to guess the super crosses a motorcycle\nA event ah two tires on those yeah I Know well you know a couple of things to um [noise] I uh I'm anxious to uh ask them about 'cause I get them on my email once you're a customer discount tire they send you stuff all the time on the\nUh they send you reminders have your tire pressure needs to be checked a your tire rotation is due to to be checked they also send you a reminders of\nCoupons discounts we have a special thing happened in this ah this month a and I think you'll find overall uh you know the tires pretty much a comparable or maybe better priced a than others but I the one question I wanted to ask Brian I don't know I'm ... how we missed him but um [noise]\nIs how many types of tires do they carry that's a question I Want to know just on stock in an average store or what they can get a whole but they can get a hold up on me yeah I mean because I'm a you know I've ... I deal with the John down there to runs tire and ah he had a bunch of huge tractor tires out front oh yeah\nIn one of those situations where people bringing tires that are too unsafe to touch your work on at all what should they do\nUh get rid of them as soon as I can so it would have them take it out to the desert and shoot it with a pellet gun [laughter]\nNow allow a drive through our trust the experts that find the right power and power\nNow allow a drive through our trust the experts to find the right power and power customers to buy the pirates are looking for [noise] you know I could safely on the road\nYou know Brian one of the things I was talking about I'm ... and the first segment on does today about ah my experience with discount tire was the um level of professionalism that you get inside the store with the uh store representatives\nI'm In Bruce how story he talks about the fact that ah that that he built this company around the employees that are that are trying to rather than trying to compete\nIn a commodity market with price he competed with with a professional service I've noticed that at every single solitary a discount tire that I've been to and I've only been to before 'cause I've only moved a couple of times in the state\nAnd they've always had won a nearby but do you feel that you'd get that as an employee of that that they\nJust they they look to uh their employees for professionalism and then they also are as his quoted earlier he says if you do if you do what you're supposed to do you'll have a job with me forever that's basically quoting him Bruce\nThat is correct he he's got a there are only a really five simple lessons life um it said be honest work hard have fun be grateful and pay it forward [noise] um as far as what he left us with as well to an industry everybody like the same as you want to be treated yourself\nYeah well I think that you know discount tier is new to the area but they're certainly not new to the country and they're not new to Arizona\nBut some people from back east might know you buy a different name as I understand it some of your east coast stores are still called America's tires that correct\nIt's on the west coast we've got eighty stores that are America's higher than the rest are nine hundred stores are discount tire\nThere's nothing in Florida under America's tier I thought they were not they're not just California than okay I've I ... I miss the ocean I was ah see I got the wrong motion Pacific now the last week but um [noise] uh and now also you know as a customer of speaking myself\nOr I get updates when I Need my tier pressures checked I get updates when are you my tires rotated you have a computer it's keeping track of everybody's service records and gives us updates um you also do you also send out a special coupons deals coming up so for me too\nWe do if you on the guys that were email address a you know in our system more than a reminders promotions coming up time to get rotation I'm getting ... pressure down so that's great for the customers back there two hours last longer um so it's good for everybody\n[noise] you know one of the things that I learned Saturday while I was waiting again for my um my tires to be rotated and balanced a on a six thousand miles schedule six ... six thousand miles rotation schedule was a there was a a car that had a very\nThin tire with a big big wheel\nAnd I asked him I said that that writes pretty how does that right and he and I think you know Jason down there and ... yes yeah\nJason told me that that tire will ride very rough because there's no uh there's really no cushion in between and and it's not so much the Christian but here's a here's what I learned and I'll let you kind of verify how this works\nHe said the smoothness of the ride and you're in your car tire is undecided will so the the the more side while you have the Moore area that you're tire has to I guess give when it's hitting bumps as well is that kind of how it works\nThat is true Dave yes you bet anything from more rubber between you're on the road that though that rides gonna be the last forever you put on your salary bumping contract wrote quite a bit ... and they never vehicles are common with those kind of tired as well too\nYou know I hate to date myself but this is going to do it um [noise] when uh when I first started buying tires I'm On my Model T um the ah [noise] the the radio tire was a new thing I mean that was a brand new deal um\nBefore which is regular whatever they call them tires Vulcan honest rubber ... into for how much have tires changed and what has changed over the years that you've seen my\nNon they use better equipment to build these cars nowadays Derek conditioner men's go into these tires make them last longer and\nUm different compounds are used to always change change dramatically you can rotate tire side to side on to worry about that old wives' pelvic can't rotate tire side to side and you can't cross some but you can pretty much anyone tires anymore of long as they're not directional [noise]\nAnd that's and that's basically based on new or do they still use rubber tires\nOut so okay save a lot of uh\nOh so okay save a lot of other chemicals and stuff as well to ah one of our ... our tires were used orange ... believe it or not get up there for the environment\nWhere are you able to comment on what did you say you have the orange peel orange peel yes the ... yes yes so that's where you got that Florida information maybe that was there and I know of that\nOkay so different materials and now I remember when you buy a tire\nThat uh they would give you you know ten to twenty thousand miles on it on a tire that's well maintained with the new materials\nRotated regularly what's a average a mileage on a tire these days I Know they vary by you know the types and so forth but I'm just talking about the everyday average Joe driving a view of down the road tire trying to\nBe like oh you get a forty to fifty thousand I don't know if you do make cameras like you're saying Dave mhm\nDoes that get any lower in these kinds of climates we have here\nDoes affect the war but I mean we have a new system called P.

P. show email address the pay a damn Patrick dot com\nEither way you know we talked about change panicking and I know that we're going to get more headlines more attention to the Lakers because all abroad people want clicks or all the talking heads if you see these shows the debate shows it'll be about LeBron James and the Lakers and time to panic\nHouston Rockets who have a legitimate chance of winning an NBA title or at least maybe better than anybody else or wanted fine\nThat might be time to panic a little bit at bit one and fought they've offered for first round pitch to Minnesota for Jimmy Butler that deal is still there on the table but the rockets no one in five\nThey won't garner headlines even though you got the reigning MVP a team that you know took the Golden State warriors to seven games could have won the Chris Paul was injured they might win that game and then they would win an MBA championship\nNobody's talking about the rocket shouldn't panicking because you know why nobody cares nationally about the Houston Rockets we care about LeBron James and the LA Lakers a Milwaukee Bucks a quietly at seven and oh\nOnce again nobody cares about the Milwaukee Bucks nationally\nBut they won without the Greek freak he was in concussion protocol and the schedule not exactly murderers road there but the boxer seven to no\nFunctioning but seven to know when they're

wants fans to know we're not taking our foot off the gas now some other people looked at this and said man of the eagles desperate\n[noise] you don't want to your team to mortgage the future for declining player but you also want to know if your team is only in or not and if they're not all in okay what is our strategy here like if you're a lion's fan today\nWhat do you think it we just trading golden Tate he averages Ninety two catches a year already contract year but he's still building tape and he's a good wide receiver does he great\n... good yes is he reliable yes your marriage

I mean and that's why the rumors that rumors I thought that the patriots like go kitchen or its jackets um and I think the giants really want it to the ocean or his Jenkins um but there was nobody out there who is going to take that money off their hands\nYeah I thought I was told the patriots were probably going to surprise people are at the trade deadline and then they didn't then I sold the Boston Globe where Ben bowling said that they were there probably stockpiling these ah these picks because they're gonna go perhaps all in and taking a quarterback in twenty Nineteen\nWell just think of this and that last year in April in draft week we're always Josh make Daniels on Monday of that week Josh rate Daniels was in the home I think it was somewhere in Texas a Baker Mayfield and\nAnd if the draft it gone differently the patriots might have you know try to move heaven and earth to move up to let's say seven or ... or whatever to get Baker may feel that what they have I don't know\nBut I think it's interesting that came out a draft or we are that ... spent some time with him and it was so but I don't doubt that at all they now have for pics of their own in the first three rounds for us they will get a third round compensatory pick for both\nThe loss of eight shoulder and Malcolm Butler so if you got\nSix pick in the top one hundred which is what they will have now all of a sudden it makes it possible even if you're picking let's say thirty or wherever I don't know where they'll be if they're picking thirtieth overall in the first round now you can package\nThree or four of those picks move up the way the falcons aunts moved up twenty spots for Julio Jones and you should be able to go up and get one of the quarterbacks you don't say in the in the top ten of this
