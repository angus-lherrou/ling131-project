use\nAnd the Saudi she was right there issue is it means people who we think of as journalists reporting inaccurate and fake news about those governments and you can see the connection I'm making right or\nYou have to ask why is this happening and I do think it's happening in part because the United states is retreating premise traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for

the way the press is treated\nHim that Trump that's trumped arrangements intra that's that's exactly what it looks like it sounds like and feels like that's what these people do anything that goes

that I just play I promise you\nI can guarantee you liberals liberals listening to my voice right now are saying well you make sense to me you know it's called the press the enemy of the people so you

like an American flag\nBeing planted on the moon because the United states was the first country to get there it was a crowning achievement if you love the space program one would think you'd love the

effective and you make me think all the time it's one of the bright spots of Twitter frankly 'cause I don't like the world I don't like the the nastiness and the way these guys but you're you know you're you're like the president in that way you're going to Vegas\nAnd the way these guys but you're you know you're you're like the president that way you're going to come after you you go after them tenfold and uh and I and and you're obviously enormously successful on social media and you've got a successful career let's talk about how your career lead you to God's now\nI I Love the fact that it's not gory so I Want people to know that if they want to bring their\nTeenagers you know to see a movie that the deals with this travesty of\nOf the Philadelphia officials looking the other way as this monster ... smell were was performing these late term abortions in these horrific crimes it's not a gory thing to watch but it's obviously a disturbing message it's a powerful if any of us who believe in the sanctity of life you got to see this movie and celebrate\nThe fact that the guy is finally rotting behind bars what brought you to the project Nick and tell me what your experience was about ... was like as you as you made this movie does now the trial of America's biggest serial killer\nWhile I knew about the story or south followed the story when it happened\nAnd when I was friends with Salem and then on I was involved in the fundraising campaign when they first had the idea to raise the money on and he goes right now and when we started talking to they started talking about making a film after\nThey had the script they asked me if I knew when he directors and I sent them a couple and they didn't work out and so then I sort of submitted myself\nAnd they watch the film that I made a few years ago and decided that I could do it so\nThat's kind of how they brought me in and when I read the script that Andrew claiming or oh I knew that I really wanted to do it there was\nSo much about the script for that though it was an rubble and and and informative and fair and I thought\nYeah this is this is the way to go about this we don't want to shock anybody but harder with the war we don't want to tell people what to think about the issue what we want to do is is tell the story and let let the facts the story work however they work and and the mind of the audience\nBut what fascinates me is what you guys produce this movie and and and gave us something that dealt with facts and yet you still had a world of hurt and headaches and trying to get the movie made there was all kinds of controversy weren't there are places that didn't want to let you shoot scenes on location\nYou know we didn't have you know that that may have been I mean we shot the movie in Oklahoma City I I didn't do ... Haitian management stuff I'm just the the lowly director but yeah you know we ... we found a way to to make the movie work\nAnd a ... and and and we had to build some some\nSense and convert some uh some church buildings here and there in the courtrooms thing yeah but we did find a way to get the movies shot\nNext year she's the director of the the movie guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer again this was an abortion doctor in Philadelphia internationally if you want to see what nic looks like he's he's one of these guys you know and I mean he's in a million movies and TV shows and always working so feel free to pop on a\nOnto the computer go to Mike online dot com and click to watch my TV button and you'll be able to to see ... as he joins us from his undisclosed location via Skype a you know 'cause all these big movie stars have undisclosed location it's shocking\nNick back to the movie for a moment that they weren't well it ought to be shocking that so many officials and so many people in a forty new ... new what ... was doing\nBut didn't stop and can you can you speak to that because that to me is one of the biggest takeaways of what we learned about the trial and the whole case of Kermit guns now\nWell you know I'm not so sure that they knew the stamp of what he was doing it because the fact of the matter is they didn't inspectors clinic or Seventeen year I mean they they they were not\nThere was a conscious decision in the in the higher ups in the government and the governor's office governor of Pennsylvania that they did not want to be perceived as being anti woman they're anti reproductive rights and\nSo they said that the the policy was by the end so vain you forward it out it was not to inspect abortion clinics unless there was a specific why now even that in in God's nails a case there were a number of\nComplaints about it but still or whatever reason the bureaucracy not inspectors clinic so I don't think they they did not know how bill the it was they did not know how unsanitary was and the irony is of course as we say in the movie\nThey're required to inspect nail salons once a year just to make sure that they're operating on and that the condition\nBut they never they didn't win his clinic or Seventeen year\nA Seventeen that's what's so astounding about that she got to see this movie and you've got to appreciate the fact that the justice was eventually serve you know I I saw in a ...\nSo if this was eventually sure you know I I saw in a one ... pick your brain a little bit about about the knee jerk reaction to actors\nAnd politics Roseanne Barr at the last night they did the re boots Connors a it was well done just let Roseanne they fired her over one tweet it was a defensive tweets are but you know what that was it a B she said you're done you're finished we're going to go we're going to go on without you and I saw very sad portrait of Roseanne\nOn vice last night on HBO she's obviously anguished she's bitter she's a she's a heartbroken that her baby was taken from her\n... what's your take on the way people can be shut down and yet the left can say anything Bill Maher Chelsea Handler you know go down the list to Kathy Griffin there definitely is a huge double standard when it comes to retribution for people for things people say on social media is they're not\nAbsolutely and uh you know I better watch what I say about this I may have no I Know he gets in trouble\nI Do believe that there is a complete double standard it is it the leftist for even for almost anything they say they're actually reward it a lot of times for\nCalling people racist and and ... you know wearing an entire\nPart of the nation is being Nazis white supremacists and and and this kind of thing and uh you know one one slip up on the other side and and you see what happened\nI mean Roseanne is in a particularly vulnerable position because she has a show that she had a show that was built we we around her personality and win a major network has to get behind a show like that\nThey they tend especially at the uh right leaning personality causes some controversy they're not going to stay behind it are very law\nNext year she uh again we we'd Meyer your voice if you want to follow his tweets and it's not for the faint of heart at yes Nick seriously at yes\nNext year she is his Twitter handle what are we going to see you in ... what do you what project is coming up on the rise\nWell there's a movie and it just they announced it's coming out next year called best enemies that

Saudis what you know they're they're very serious over their drug or repressive you notice about these Middle Eastern countries there are no human rights\nYou know we talk about you know this country waiting banners or human rights and you don't want to do you know take a stand against a various countries because they're human rights abuses by the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse we've probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that don't get counted\nLet me ask you about the scams first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else why do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids\nIn a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know if they if the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nAh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy rights are there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan so you know the novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation\nOr something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know are they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan that's all they were going to take calls next hour with Alan in those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to\nDefault on the loan they want to default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them and when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nLots of defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the service there isn't a guarantee tours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan that remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that uh the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission\nRight off the wall so you know where they can\nMake the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of\nFour or five six years on a defaulted loans that they compel the bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that under this for a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nNo explained the process of a defaulted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college\nAnd let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of and by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduation what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years [noise]\nAh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars\nWhat with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive in the bottle or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so a thousand dollars\nOh my God so what\nThe ... what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment\nWe can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nIt'll be taxed to you something like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind pipes um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards alone\nThis just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for a much newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nShe's in the ... these agents or collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than ah than alone that remains is good said I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nDo not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate\nThey default again three to four oh and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan if that's the fault again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling [noise] goes to goes do you\nFive nine for nine seven two three four to talk to a real live competed critical Health News dot com human eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson once said there are two ways to cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will\nOften than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun's\nThen they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server and the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWill that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war power as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of the default the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the ...\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of\nThe loan at the time that it defaulted what kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan went into fault is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they want to to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nTo this cross a part party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama Obama especially federal lies the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this\nCurse on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nYou would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy divide us who herself had stock in struggle and collection companies [noise] ah and you know I frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could file bankruptcy and wipe out to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing and we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is one sided student loan justice done or linked up and go to go day in his book is called the student loans scam you're on some kind of nationwide tour these days only what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code that makes student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college uh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality\nOf the job that the government does administering the program a so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nHandling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma a is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of the student loan issues\nHi this is just on you name a dish and also from the head and the houses of time even on young cook enough to all of this Seventy million kids in America was struggling this

nineteenth century\nBut people there were totally used to UFOs flying all over the place about them and called them off nice no one was afraid of the things they took them for granted it was just part of their lives so unless you're taught to be afraid of these things you're not really saving them\nDid you ever talk down about visitations abductions or anything like that than anybody ever she occupants up close yes\nThey saw ... nobody was abducted\nDid they ever describe what they look like\nA you know because my grand mother the granddaughter of this man told me this and uh you know she wasn't there but everybody in the town when she would go to visit her grandparents everybody would say oh you have to see the ... you know you'll love\nIt [laughter] what do you think\nNot a big deal you know\nNo well it's it's a great point which is of course it goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no\nI'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen\nStrange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this cold and these these familial recollections is is the fact that\nYou know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and how ... and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this\nThis thing is is almost to call in place that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\n... real let's go to Andy in Norwalk, California now why Andy Glyn\nHi George you're agreeing patron and Mr call it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very\nInformed and entertaining to listen to um I have two part question if I may uh first of all a based on all of your knowledge of\nThe western powers all of the needle countries and for that matter and let's say the eastern bloc countries ... how many ... as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs and\nBased upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away\nWhile we're waiting for that one\nNow I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the answer is less than\nThan a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities I mean I've seen some people talk about pilots carrying missing and and your fires and I think\nYou know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous um occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of lot of ... just\nThis period because they crashed now now of course then you have\nDo you have some classic cases like a ... the mentality case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing it\nIf he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the famous we coming off of cost the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most famous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes that was strange I think we're literally they use the way in Australia right yes\nI absolutely over the or is it by trade I think all the times men straight making the bass straight is part of the past month the excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but\nUm but I I don't buy into the rumors that that I've heard the pilots were\nWere sharing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we have a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his cross into the city\nIn in Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise\nAnd some people years later I tried to attribute to UFO a story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry\nFile which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in not filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think\nI think the answer the question is is very few\nVery handy okay go ahead and say oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this ah as you\nProbably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the sky\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo stop the pursuit the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes\nAnd I asked them what are the chances of a life or not existing on other planets and knocked coming and visiting us ah and he said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective than\nI Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years and I had the bus they could be entered the mention all they could be ... are both\nBut I don't think we're much of a match\nAnd they do have air superiority\nAnd [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nIn the Persian and will set by the way you know and\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence so fast and ... and that was a I I don't like to call it amusing\nBut ah I it was kind of poignantly amusing maybe ... there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you ate Pete skewed which goes directly\nOf of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation in ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but if I actively a pilot's encountering you ate pay should take no action\nApart from trying to place the object is done in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with it\nNo mess with it at all we're going to take a break pretty soon that can come back with funnel phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've done a thriller out cold blooded brothers don't you\nYeah I Do a kind of a different thing for you yes\nI um ... although I'm best known for having run the UFO program I did a lot of other things in my Twenty one years at the MIT and my final posting was in the direct threat to defend security we did a lot of counter terrorism and things\nI've written fiction before I've written to fight fight novels about alien invasion\nSo I decided to write a thriller about terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn Kendall now

our final segment with Nick Pope of course huge part of the healing ends up the Pentagon filmed the DVD as well in his latest book is an action thriller called blood brothers and how do you get the book Nick\nWell its own chemical at the moment I'm a I'm comes out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon so so basically I just go get dramas and look up blood brothers make pope or it's on late Nick ... website on the books\n... in your opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like the so called de Leon graze the people described or do they look like gosh what do you think\nWell it's tricky question because I think the media I kind of might have this this kind of\n... or ... or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think um you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray large head\n... shaped oh it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but in my experience when people report and she's just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAll they sure do what you just saw almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think ... plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nYou imagine what a civilization which you say a million years head

because they're human rights abuses by the countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation\nOh George great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans doors they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we've probably at it and I think I was on about a year ago we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab which is now sitting officially about uh\nYeah which is now sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still with a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nSo let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know at the the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nUh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that the students in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan [laughter] ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there\nBut I can tell you that what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniformed bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan ... we're going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when\nYou do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition oh\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to uh be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan\nThey want the default don't that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nLots of defining hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the service there isn't a guarantee tours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than alone the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a ... in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled the borrower to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans\nThey got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of\nTo make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... there's a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnowing explained the process of a defaulted alone in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so I'm fifty thousand or student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars\nWhat with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive in the lower is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so a thousand dollars\nOh my God so what\nThe what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan\nBig trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the borrower\n... ultimately they will wind up its um hopefully the government hopes going through a loan rehabilitation so this is why they make payments\nFor about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that ... this rehabilitation\nAnd at the end of the process they wind up signing for a much newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... these agents or collection companies well yeah these agents are typically\nI'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone that remains it's good said I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nDo not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four oh and they just keep growing oh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan if that's the fault again\nAnd that happens something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here in the again we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling us goes to goes down\nAnd I'll be I Can't [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson once said there are two ways the cocker an inch labor nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loans\nAnd if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nThey will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun's\nThen they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or primary process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nRuled that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on a resting between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight\nThousand dollars which included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy rates ahead of the power to declare war and the power is an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey old fifty thousand now they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do what you're saying because of these defaults fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that and grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted what kind of settled on his\nOwn for most people it's\nA completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan went into falls is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there is about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse or under Obama Obama especially federal lives the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae Nell et cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profit\n... on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in student loan collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy and wipe out your student that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise]\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court\nAnd they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable [noise]\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights\nAre and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is west side of the student loan justice dot org linked up and go to go the dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of nationwide tour these days only what you doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program [noise] ah so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma or is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of the student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say a but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson\nSays a service announcement from taking fishing or to determine its unique fishing licence distraction before heading out on the

yet unknown substance Dr John Curtis online columnist dot com with us it's clear somebody killed this guy John\nOh George great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans door that they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] oh hell yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you've you've got an option here and that is going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have a lemon laws right if the school provides a you know if the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for students\nFair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman lives right if the school provides a you know if if the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like that that they had a guarantee that a student in the his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan so you know they'll novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation\nOr something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there but I can tell you that what we have now today\nIs the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen\nA you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nOr people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan absolutely we are going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with someone and see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition oh\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn the loan they wanted to default don't that's right if it becomes\nMore financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead\nLots of defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantee tours are often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled to borrow or to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off\nThe wall so you know where they can\nMake the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that ... there's a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nSpleen to process all the defaulted alone in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let's let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents\nStudent goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good ... easy numbers to start with so I'm fifty thousand dollar student loan when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nOr they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise]\nUm the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default\nSo the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around oh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive in the bar is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so a thousand dollars oh my God so what the ... what\nThe lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life\n[noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully in the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is why they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party\nAgents that oh Tate this rehabilitation\nAnd at the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars while these agents and get a sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's no net there's the Pennsylvania education systems agency [noise] ah and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone that remains is good said I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate you're alone it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default\nAgain three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan defaults again\nAnd that happened something like eighty percent of the time then the whole process starts again\nStay with us Allan let's talk about if there's any recourse here in ... and then yeah we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast they\nSign up no recoup zone or read email newsletter today it's good to go day I'm Duncan [noise]\nFive nine for nine seven two three four to talk to a real live competent critical Health News dot com human eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas Jefferson once said there are two ways the cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the ... then\nGet it maybe they don't if they don't get the summons\nThen they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWill that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was a three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy and literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until you agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nLet's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy rates ahead of the power to declare war power as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand now they want to pay them the let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of the ... the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that and grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the ...\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying then also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a part party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats and Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama Obama especially federal lives the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as those that I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property nuts\nBirth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this nonsense you know of all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy divide us\nWho herself had stock in struggle and collection companies [noise] ah and you know I frankly I don't think President Trump has really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds [noise]\nUh so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could a file bankruptcy in white bump to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy writes in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights\nAre and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan calling ... student loan justice done or linked up and go to ... dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of nationwide tour these days don't me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nUh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program a so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nGetting pulled over for bus driving costs you around ten thousand dollars in fines legal fees

I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that\nThat is that the I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost forty three\nSplit decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a far right conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's money go into an arm of the state government college\nAnd were being over tax that don't do that in real as a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security but we can only cut those things a little bit the um\nThe third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only that the the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuelan Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to\nMake me the leader of the larger group and I hope I'm I he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much and you know [laughter] but\nIt's an ... and all of the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total that it's college debt and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of that you want to let him get a credit card\nIdaho okay with the loans but let me get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock and the I Love I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here it's\nPrime can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look and he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nAnd if all these rich banks and these colleges can get the rates on student looking here that that that that those are the two beneficiary and here in\nAn okay and he's the third or are we uh got your point there ... Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq [noise]\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion her show at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices back down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill who has all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white to clean\nWell I Will say that if you had a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means\nIf that does not happen then we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum of the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWell when you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they are currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today\nSo I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\nSo yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other lender has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improved their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco head\nWell George you said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they even pay for my books but the federal government makes you go to student loans\nBut the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling so I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that\nOh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars just like Allen Heather pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Ellen ... these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship for any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's\nIt's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on uh it's probably the income based repayment program so bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program\nAnd actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nDo the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know seeking to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nResume and saying they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was [noise] ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettisoned all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back

R.\nDot com [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back this is our final segment with Alan ... as we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I think it's that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars\nMore than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation a auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that didn't prove the economy [noise]\nAh so certainly is hurting in that respect [noise] uh and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels\nDirectly to sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't other wise do I'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nLet's go to Paul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you take my call thank you very much Georgia now them [noise] um I graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe was talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I ah got\nThirty four thousand thirty seven thousand but I got you know that I owed forgiven\nWow how'd you do that and regulations\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a heart away um there's something called a you'll finding\nOut what that is is that like a lifting of\nPretty much like a courses you cook or a trait that trade you go yeah and what it is is um if they are of course he'll uh the reason they're in the situation because they both by ... so if you were\nFrom a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broad so it actually took me from I Would have to say December outlook they seem to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris and email\nUm she surprisingly bonded um but the the avenue that I went to get all that are given to write a cover letter I'm I submitted a pretty much with a cover letter I had to put money on it then I had to pretty much uh put it all out there what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually I have to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that that gun it reduced I guess right\nAh yes that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the whole college commercials what the problem with his life long job placement of quickly so what how I false\nAdvertising you exactly so one of the schools shut down there goes your fall on the job place there goes your your life long but at the right you got that right ah interesting Alan isn't it\nThat you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point and show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like to just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degree is this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you an avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now too\nLow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who were lied to by their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by ... for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWell you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... NATO provided to you there are a Greek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that one I'm\nA now there are other there are some avenues of the the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hence and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that alone is not\nLittle suspect little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up along\nThe path in Minneapolis used to the Rockies hyped ... go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and\nFigured out that at ... at least one of the

life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified tells them\nFor ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I look to see it as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing them for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um ... or the ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living\nTrying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools they're just out in the country and they're working and that like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on to this president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism\nOr embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up and the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue and actually pass legislation to stop that this was an emergency what's happening to this country\nAnd to learn the now with bacteria in coming towards the border and I think the president\nIs standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era I Know you have to we first met Washington\nBack during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and it was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump have backbone and\nWould never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve and confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think adamant Lindsey Graham was the hero\nOf German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised us that he would uh and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work\nYou know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nI you're listening to your health the radio addiction in five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration um shows that most people want legal immigration\nEither to remain the same and that's a million people a year and a lot or or to be decrease so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent wanting to level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nA aunt and driven in school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo uh you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and a ... year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested of a seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash\nOn e just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll just\nThe the other day of this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll tell ya\nIn Buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what the illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue\nTalking about how important\nAre ... immigration is to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining is illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nHe's against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process is the first the immigration process\nThen the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer is expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it\nYou know and the problem she sees is this the surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here\nIllegally some of them are now over ... etcetera\nAnd since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly\n... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form\nA and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar a Michael\nTo the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh a and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings the the uh the people running down the uh the always the base of the United states Capitol screaming at senators\nThe the people trapping senators\nAn elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they'd like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house because\nA lot of people who were not measure well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call us deplorable right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know ... in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and\nI'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote on it and and this time around they better do it because\nThey think the part of the president's not on the ... ... is\nOur moment ... ... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening in the twenty

your attention to critical races across the country one of them at Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty\nNo Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania it's seven he joins us now and also it's an avid cyclist was in the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nBy lower first of all thanks for having me\nYeah you know covering every quarter of this district which is now a new district Pennsylvania seventh district has everything from the urban core of Allentown Beth I'm an east and to the cause of farming communities in the northern tier work district what we call this late dealt\nA region now what what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is a people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice plugging economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house I'm a ... in in Congress [noise]\nWhat what a ... when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what a traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to are trying to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration when we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth people don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\n[noise] yeah I think that's really on a lot of people\nThe border\nYeah I think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nOr we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration up here in Lee high valued customers seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty citizen wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the\nWoman or because of the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... what would\nThey try to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary uh somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move\nTo the center but um her results speak for themselves or\nYou know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and\nBureaucracy you know for an pitching the president teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's where she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American\nWorker the American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that\nOr go backward\nI've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black mask\nAnd smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries and America they want America to be a a safe prosperous nation where security is paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raise\nHigh and I think it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in March uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nGrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side as it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd hunted funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America is standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stain or might Marty Nothstein I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nThe following is not an actor that are real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need him home trinity one eight hundred seven nine for over four three something when\nOr the commonwealth of Virginia this was a conservative blue collar\nMilitary a lot of veterans and now if if Barbara Comstock loses in Fairfax County Virginia and she's behind and it's a congressional race reelection she loses\nI saw something on TV say I guess what Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll well tell us that immigration is adversely affected their commute\nWell tell us that immigration is adversely affected their communities because it has so I'll give you that a stat just a moment Dr Marc Christian is with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing it sounded counsel at the Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's on Donald Trump's falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the ship the local community and and you're right when you have a party that is run by the by them and uh uh you know all those all the guards that it looks like they are often from inside when I I think actually this um\nYou know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we are not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this when you know many people that she doesn't understand you know that she shouldn't between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the ... and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times\nAnd that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East so uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense he's doing this because the Saudi Government the government the government is doing a good work that helps them not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous president without states and why I'm saying that because you when you look at what the current um come prince and the south the government is doing\nTheir head thinking many fronts the number one is\nThe other day I think by defending the Islamic movement by looking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries had been denied states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east you're helping big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how a company is putting those on\nBy debating the oil prices and and on all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty that never ever be imagined before and then Trump is about to announce that are very very soon\nWhat is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's in Egypt and Israel which is going to be eliminating the danger all this conflict that has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the gun on\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons unknown and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship ... plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to follow the due process\nTo go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I\nI tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which you know nothing happens by coincidence when\nUh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time after the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster\nAnd the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point\nWell I think again mark ... America in ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points of the left the ... which again it's it's ... it's so sad and it's so predictable\nThey always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it's it's women are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats\nThe president ... I mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about the meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people\nAre giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people\nWho are about to cross into America unless we do something about the thousands and thousands of people many of them as an adult men or young a military age men who are have joined this caravan and are being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country elect poorly\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against that total lawlessness\nA dynamite and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have rotten ideas which is why they always go to this year's men and all kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing\nBut when I say attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but go for Donald Trump\nAnd an historic on way and then right after that they start talking about the current events washing to the orbit of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to

know well I became a libertarian it's why I went to law school and I I I argued the way I did it why when I teach um see like a classic\nSoon as I listen to this isn't the guy who runs the comedy cellar comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of\nAnd then it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went and she's tried to do this he bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on his age so the New York times of the exhaust every report about trying to talk to the club owner but why you let him on stage this is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision\nBut some other people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work and he's like\nNever mhm might never say never\nSay well could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he's I don't care never admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the harvest place what you would say particularly to a female customer who somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nWas credibly obviously accused in Juanita broader I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere nobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were the years why were they giving standing ovation whether they were after accused of sexually abusing the accused ... he did it up behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Luis became a comedian\nIs someone who gives them a stage and in this case that you wrote him had nobody cares that Mike Tyson who rapes are convicted of raping somebody performs looking only control the venue you control yes but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistent wow and you see wildly inconsistent demand if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser ... in front of women and explode and stuff and women should never work again\nYeah I I ... I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of\nOkay but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these other circumstances but he's supposed\nTo yeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this and I mean he he well he some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to say well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and try out it personally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well\nOf look what it's aligned\nWe don't allow him Lewis he came to work so what does that mean does he go in the government do\nTo do or putting working other jobs can work what if Louis the cake hired by Walmart would that be okay\nI I think it's it's a fascinating I ever support himself\nIn life yeah again and the idea that this guy has not been punished for English sanity yeah the Manhattan was making ten million dollars a year and he's probably not making a more the making of the comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing but I wouldn't be surprised if he just walked in and does it because he wants to do it\nOr he has you know paid for this and in a large way\nUm and you know it's it's certainly affected his career in a big waste last movies he's lost jobs\nBut I mean we saw this with Charlottesville\nThere was a guy who and again we're talking about a consensual act ... yeah yeah a contentious time he'd actually did it yeah it was it was intangible and it will there was one case in which as we discussed the will to them no\nAnother case on the phone where we don't know what happened another case where he started doing it and the woman left because she didn't what are you part of it will suffer or you know that's what she should she should walk out or I think he's a loser and tell every all of our friends that he's a loser for right um but that does that mean that he should be losing jobs ten or Fifteen Years later\nCharlottesville is another great example of this\nLook we use other people we play the video and the and the audio of a you know Jews will not replace us and and all these crazy chance from the real dirt bags or in in Charlottesville carrying torches and ... you know that the deepest darkest corners of the alt right and ... one of the guys\nWho attended a rally and was in some of those videos\nOr was identified as a man who worked at a hot dog stand in California\nHe was fired from his job at the hot dog stand now how is it is a good outcome for anyone that look if he is saying to black customers I won't serve you because you're black obviously we get that\nInto indication that I'm In the kitchen if that ever happened he did his job seemingly right for every one he was serving hotdogs and making hotdogs and it was not like you know he was not in a high levels of finance here [laughter] and so now we we are we can all feel good about ourselves or power dynamic\nOf a hotdog vendors is fairly ... that are still there\nYeah make up a hotdog vendors is fairly ... that are still intimidated or other people that's true so so I guess that we can all feel good about ourselves\nBut the fact that we are instead of him having a job at a hot dog stand instead we will support him with our tax dollars\nBecause he's going to be at home and all these projects and programs that liberals have created over the years to support people in need are going to go to this white supremacist who can no longer hold down his job at a hotdog stance crazy for two morally above him\nBut I ... I don't want to ever hang out with a guy who would go to that rally and carry a torch and the Jews will not replace a never but I mean you do what we do is we just find every one of these\nGuy you wanted you to replace you [laughter] you ever consider you want to I Would rather not\nBy anyone [laughter]\nI never have considered that include uh gee I guess I guess I don't like me\nOr anyone else yeah it does include that uh but I guess [laughter] I really don't want anyone um it's just a it's a weird thing we're dealing with because you know finding someone a in a video and identifying them on line gives you the sort of rush of\nEyes out at this terrible person and I can punish him who really punishing\nI mean are you ... for certainly you're punishing the tax payers of this area who now have to support the loser who actually somehow was able to hold down a job selling hot dogs and now has to fit inside probably playing X. box while you're paying him to do it\nAnd you know water when but don't celebrate that one I I I don't know it's a strange direction for us to be going in his ... ... yes\nYes it's nuts it's absolutely crazy\nOr so maybe the answer is um they just can't be alive anymore I mean is it almost comes down to that because if they can't support themselves\nAnd certainly the state you don't want them supported by your tax dollars right so against all people who are accused just starve to death now now I I guess that's what it comes ...\nThat's the way it works and I I Would be nice for us to find some consistency in this world would you know the fact that like you know if you want to say the me too movement I bet you most people are you sure you get hurt you get Harvey Weinstein mentioned\nUm and you might get more maybe Kevin Spacey or one of the other two you know few few big stars but what you would almost definitely get is Donald Trump and Roy Moore and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd every conservative or anyone even supposedly leaning right that you can think of that was accused of those have all had huge play in the media the I mean what's the percentage Ninety five percent have been on the left\n... it's all Hollywood and news media people and I mean it's been almost everyone has been in those industries and those industries obviously an incredibly to the left the idea that\nThey can say right wing phenomenon I mean it just seems like the people who are on the right pay the price for it or people on the left you know don't necessarily see that the same way and you know I think you have to get to a point where\nSomeone like Louis decay who was I think are\nAccused ... correctly of being a dirt bag right to his ... to his own admission but not not any nothing that was over this line of sexual assaults at least it's not as reported\nYou know you have to look at these things as they said I mean it's even sorry is now doing shows again um and he was a he was accused of something um you know what's his face from the New York times he's back\nOr or Glenn or what the heck is his name you know we get it wrong ... use of a of harassing you're young interns and other underlings and he he's back at work\nWe have this weird and why I mean Mike Tyson is pretty clear the mayor was convicted of rape not not choose I'm convicted of rape spent time in prison yeah and he's like the darling\nOf the media he comes ... because it's silly appearances everywhere have a problem going anywhere now doing anything and he's I mean and look he served time he's out right now\nUm and so you can make the case as the left has me forever that people who go in felons should be able to come back and vote he should be we they have programs to give felons and convicted felons and murderers jobs\nYet but when someone's accused of something much less than murder they can never work again and not even convicted just accused of ... yeah that really doesn't make any sense dribbling seven twenty seven back is the phone number or it is a pat and sue for Glenn who\nUh is traverse thing currently uh the Mediterranean Sea\nIn a canoe or he's always wanted to do it and he finally said you know what this is a week so that he's doing it alone alone which is amazing\nSummer to millions of students working summer jobs but there are certain jobs that are off limits for young people where he was and how many\nHi I'm Janet Williams even though I never knew my father Hank Williams his legacy taught me the meaning of lending a helping hand\nThat's why I support the Boston foundation of America\nOh if they committed to providing education mentoring in a workplace readiness for thousands of teams aging out of the foster care system with the help of what they support programs these young people can go to college and high school graduate and make the leap from foster care to fix them learn how you can help both in dot or\nIf but when I leave ...

[noise]\nNow you're talking now you're talking about a life [laughter]\nI guess your life with five hundred and Thirteen million would not be that great but if you could add on a couple of million dollars [laughter]\nThat's how you start now you'd be right now you're some vacation value or a pill and you're like you know I'm going to get\nThirty percent when I go out to a restaurant that's when that ... that time when he gets like nine hundred yeah you know nine fifty\nAnd I was drinking large is it time to stop that the author of the waiters expecting tips is it time to time the restaurants pay the waiters a decent wage and then I don't have to worry about paying tip then less they do an outstanding job because now they expect expect me to pay them of their salary\nEither that or I or I had a very high level job as a a\nChili's waiter ... for a couple of years ... uh and uh the minimum wage at the time I Believe was four twenty seven an hour and you got for like two and I got to twelve I remember getting thank you well over an hour was with my with my shoe out really well of course that wow reason is because you're getting tips and you're going well over\nThe minimum wage right in my view that and you get of course I mean yeah you know it was it was not hard to get two dollars an hour and chips\nOr even for me and I was a crappy waiter or buy a twelve hour the check would come in after two weeks it'll be like sixty dollars [laughter]\nI didn't cash is worth it yeah it was almost gotten dumb like probably spend sixty bucks get\nTo the to the the ... yeah yeah that's ridiculous it is\nIt's got a bad you know there is also a for you to I was thinking of you well as I was reading this new study um the burger chains are having failing grades with their antibiotic use in their ...\nOh I Know I Know I'm not sure one he's five burger James reveal a very different pattern now there's a new study the chain reaction burger edition and if you thought it was going to be slanted [laughter]\nNo that's produced by Consumer Reports along with the center for food safety friends of the earth was owed animal concerns trust the natural throws the end of the failure down saw guile us public interest research group\n... those are some of my favorite agent thank you for the earth and the ... the the the resource defense counsel those are two I mean you want to talk about all full environmental organization [laughter]\nThose are the top of the list\nBut the use of antibiotics in the beef industry is a terrible scare people ... terrible right so there's ... there's only two restaurants that uh you know fast food chains that got the essays are in their belief that they don't use any beef with antibiotics burger phi which I've never been\nTo never heard of that and shake shack oh really ... right I Know I ... them at all that yeah I Want to guide held let's check let's go to Joe right now relatively us [laughter] leave right now I feel that just I just kind of put the microphone down [laughter]\nWhat kind of the studio and go to ... now good all the other\nFast food restaurants failed except for Wendy's you've got to the minus because they have now committed to sourcing a small percentage of beef they got to be millionaires who minimize\nDon't they don't limited by producers will minimize the house of medically important antibiotics so once in a while you're going to get a burger with that doesn't have any bad\nAnd what is what is the antibiotic into burger doing to us is it is making a link to claim\nTheir claim is that it's making us resistant to change\nThe way our core a left wing environmental groups are saying there's bad things in their right or watch I'd that means absolutely nothing to me\nI'm guessing there's worse things than antibiotics and they're like you know cow poop\nBut mixed in good faith a nicely because some of this stuff is not done really well\nYeah did you see this report um la Croix water that came out I think it was this week you know yeah water sparkling like oh yeah\nI was states fruit flavored but now if you've ever had a drink of it like you would be like what is that oh I can detect that I'm In line it's not an instance late for like a road in my opinion not not a fan but they tried to come out the same thing like oh well there's an ingredient here that's included in this terrible thing and and you go through the course\nOf course at the end of the day there's absolutely nothing to the report because that is what you know medical journalism it's time to its especially about food ... they just try to say like well this ingredient is included in some other thing that sounds scary\nUm of course you don't eat nearly enough to come close to any problematic areas that are constantly\nOff to come close to any problematic area where you are constantly you know we can't miss some of those\n... shouldn't say that would be interesting to point of us need to be concerned [laughter] if you're eating as much as nine horses would eat well okay I Am ... falls into that category so but I mean we get so scared about these things and and\nNinety nine percent of it it's nothing like a year ago and you can have all the things that they say you could never touch you can have as long as you don't go crazy with them\nAs long as you're not constantly eating them all the time you're going to be okay and honestly most of the stuff even if you are eating it all the time you're ... you're probably going to be okay and then we're pretty resilient creatures here I don't even\nTell from a guy who's who's in the past drank roundup yeah so you know frankly a commercial my viewpoint\nBut yet they had to come around here and\nThere to prove that that as well I didn't ...\n... on the planet I'm Still alive\nThough they're making headway with the chicken the company with with the big companies that are using chicken because you've got a AAA put era and chick fillet number one they use because without antibiotics\nDid you go to the Al Sharpton pronunciation of my life she landed on so I have to accept it I don't ... I mean I I don't I seriously I really I Can't see it on the sign ...\nIts AAA because they've already said that area was April ... Romney went to a ... like to hear it all in age would ship boat leg like\nThat that was a sharp and can't read\nThe ... I Can't call everything else but that no oh sorry that's right that's the name okay\nBut uh it's good that a subway and Taco Bell they're all trying to play along with their chicken you know they they using chickens with less antibiotics or zero antibiotics so we're good there but my favorite story as we talked a little bit about this a pet show a week or so ago the gluten free\nUh dishes that are at restaurants now that everybody does so well there's everybody has has to be good\nFor you know yeah but everybody has renewed everybody was glued nobody told if you're a suicide attack or whatever that is the ... that's one thing if you have the ... disease you\nProbably shouldn't have glue and look and there's still there's very few people have that how dare you\nOut there and I know that great right now there's approximately one percent of the U.S population with that disease why oh why aren't mainly three percent of people avoid\n[laughter] there's a there's a weird\nLike uh this happens with a lot of these issues where like people are mad at you first accusing them of not having\nI think that's a great thing you don't watch\nAny of my daughter because for a while she was on that ... oh yeah I'm like well\nYou don't see large canvas hearing\nAll these people come out and they're using cabin on like how are you not believe them and they're fighting or think we'd better if it was true what\nWomen weren't assault like would it be great but warming wasn't killing at least consider these things and not get defensive of doom right there ... like I Know I ... you must do believe that we're all going to die in ten years you must\nLike I'd rather I'd rather look at the facts and try to decipher it but I I I there is that passion people really hate it if you\nDo and the guardian going live\nMeal [laughter]\nGood news is when you order the gluten free up the restaurants odds are it's not\n...\nAt least a third is that true that they did studies and went to the restaurants in ... uh is not that shows how ... how the nonsense that is right on I mean if it were real and people really having these allergy lawsuits yeah she loved ones yeah they'd be breaking out you know they'd have to make it out\nYou really have it and you I mean you can not breathe and you know\nThat's a serious thing for the ... yeah it's just that for whatever reason everyone wants to lump themselves in this new victims that if I can write gluten [laughter] simply Seventy seven be\nBe American way of like [noise]\nCinderella is dream comes true because the glass slipper ...\nIn our world the rights it can be just as important especially when it comes to car seats always choose the car seat that the right thing for your child's age and size to make sure your little pumpkin gets there safely every time\nSanctions for more information visits safer car dot Gov slash the right seat message has been brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\n\nItself fine Lisa ...

T. E. which we're seeing a lot of in a specially football players it's it's it's very common issue\nResulting from getting hit over and over and over and help to\nBoth head injuries that's right and then there's a a slow progression of the disease and we'll talk about how how it presents because it's so it's so bizarre some of the symptoms that it it's not a surprise that its midst\nAnd we'll get into that but let's recap a little bit about concussion because a lot of folks maybe weren't with us in the last meeting or don't remember maybe they got hit in the head and they just don't remember but impish [laughter]\nBut ah you know as I said a concussion is an injury to the brain that result in a temporary loss of normal brain function temporary loss which recovers yeah I'm ... secondary to a blow to the head but there may not be an actual impact to the school itself\nIn fact you may not even fall you may just have some rapid movement of the head that causes the brain to ... move rapidly within ... inside the skull or could be a blast effect like a military recruits would\nUh experience maybe from an IUD blowing up right in front of them um and that those are those are very significant is that the amount of force that the brain absorbs is significantly greater than a maybe a two hundred fifty pound linebacker ... yeah\nYeah um and and so maybe that one blast effect may be enough to cause\nThe injury or that will be an end up in a in this heat the cause\nOf each of you just get hit by a guy all of a sudden you're a you know that's the that's all you regard as far as far as your brain what goes around in their minds that you're still in one spot but everything costs of wave a blast wave going through your interacts with the body and all of its or gooey masses as it were a much different ways\nAnd you know the younger you are you start playing the more time you get playing more head injuries you have throughout your career the more risk you are forgetting C. T. E. so this is not something to be taken lightly I mean this is really should be taken very serious and they think that we should be talking about this a lot more\nAnd [noise] hopefully will have little time at the end to talk about what we should be doing ideal yes ideally right um [noise] so what are the signs and symptoms\nSo it's it's so interesting to me because I think a lot of this has missed because the symptoms for most people would not be they wouldn't recognize this directly as as a secondary to head injury\nI'm In the in the first day just for stages them in the in the first stage they start to have attention deficit hyperactivity deceased type symptoms\nDoesn't exactly flow of what you think someone gets ahead and dream right they shouldn't be there or active so much going on what's going on I'm never mild sit down\nRight but these these guys you know I mean ... ADHD symptoms we tend to seeing you know like teenagers children and that's when we're making that\nAnd we tend to seeing you know like teenagers children and that's when we're making that diagnosis so if you guys you know twenty year old or twenty five year old or thirty or football player has multiple head injuries they should really raise a flag\nYou should be saying wait a minute ADHD and a football player who's never had it before but unfortunately who's overlook yeah always seen as though they're anxious or you know they're not playing in or they feel themselves or whatever it was always explained in inappropriate ways and then there were medicated\nWhich is which is what's dangerous because then you\nYou you you take the symptom way and nobody thinks about it right yeah um but it also in stage when they start to get they start with the confusion early confusion but it's miles right so they might you know forget a few things where to put my keys again yeah everybody has that\nSo it might be overlooked and you know they might become a little disoriented they might not know days day of the week week and the day in the months um of\nCourse again when you're in that age and you're kind of flowing with a school schedule are going to go to school five days a week I don't care which once they are like oh it's a Saturday or Sunday or whatever\nThat that's that's true um I've worked many years where I work day and night and weekend and I never knew what time of day it was so I understand that um [noise] we become there's a lot of headaches with it so that's still part of stage one and a lot of dizziness so that that's you know non specific symptoms doesn't points in the direction of saying that the tea heat\nBut we need to start thinking about that and that's I think we're clinicians need it's very important that if you put this together in a football player and you miss it I think you've missed something very important um stage two they start getting memory loss\nAnd this this starts at mile but it really progress is through stage to any progress is into stage three and four and it gets very severe um their behavior starts to change to become very impulsive\nNow that might be overlooked because you know the football players or ... athletes in general and had a\nYou know they they live dangerously they have fun they make crazy thing you know crazy choices in life you know I mean it can be explained an odd way with the absence of youth and Vermont auto right well that's right and so you know their judgments is off um they they they might have\nA you know the impulsive behaviors and might not manage the money perfectly you know they're they're just but that doesn't again doesn't you know for most people lead them in the direction of thinking of the brain injury yeah right\nI'm also they started their their entire social structures starts to break down in in in stage to but again nobody sees that because they might be a in him you know stuck in a a legal\nBattle because it's something they did because of the poor judgment so you know it's it's it's all missed this as part of a a neuro a neurological a solid you\nAre you doing any one of these things in another itself isn't necessarily an indicator that something has happened it takes a comprehensive image which I think the last time we spoke you were talking about getting free screenings of a ... before they even got a potential\nHazard the most important thing I mean if if if nothing else and they'll stop when I'm Talking about one minute to say because if we don't have time to talk about later this is key right this is absolutely is get baseline neurosis psychiatric testing and\nNarrow cognitive and nurse psychiatric testing that baseline and then repeat that every year and then any time anybody has an injury you repeat that and then use that and you follow it clinically till things start to clear so that's the most important thing\nAnd and if you take nothing home from this that's the most important thing so if you're if you're a football player boxer any a a cage fighter you hockey player like I grew up playing I mean bottom line is get the testing early\nSo it's finished with the symptoms to stage three and four or they they kinda blur together because this is where the symptoms really progress more and more but the most important thing here and say scream for is dementia\nSo ... you know they have any progress so it's mild in the beginning\nOr maybe even ... even the patient themselves might miss it and then it starts to progress through stage three and four and we're talking on a scale of years in this case we can we can yeah and in fact we don't even see most of the symptoms like this starting\nA for maybe eight to ten years after they maybe had the head injuries a series of head injuries so them so\nAnd the possibility exists at the people that knew them in that time it might not be around them anymore even friends and family\nThat's that's true and they're no longer they may no longer be you know in in the sports so they're not getting the same attention that they got from a clinicians that would be looking at them as\nHigh risk people mhm right so so they go to their family doctor he overlooked say he doesn't see it oh you have a headache okay well let's see what happens in a couple of weeks you know\nThat's that's where the problem is and so nobody put it together early on I think that's why it's so important to have the testing and then use it throughout their not just career but their lives I think it is is the bottom line [noise] um [noise] and we'll talk about other tests that are coming\nI think it is is the bottom line I'm Talking about other tests that are coming down the pike\nThey start to have a lot of movement disorders which are really interesting and that this is a like Mohammed Ali where he's very jerky movements in his um his Parkinson's like disease\nOkay well that might be overlooked again as part of a a brain injury right but it it's very common issue they get tremors they get rigidity um they get lost in court nation or their speech becomes erratic they have motor problems with their speech to not only is it happening in the brain itself\nAs far as they're not able to maybe understand a word or come up with the right word but also they're having motor problems with the you know the muscles in the face in the mouth\nAnd and actually phone aiding the word so it really becomes very difficult on many levels and it's often times missed at ... at as how severe it is until somebody maybe you know does really a intricate neurological testing like a neurologist right\nFamily doc may not see this because you're not thinking about it\nAnd this is the major progress is over time and it gets worse and it's very much like of Alzheimer's like dementia and Alzheimer's is very confusing to any type of dementia is [noise]\nBecause it's a slow onset and by the time you start to recognize it usually there's not much you can do you know unless it's caused by a\nYou know or an infection or you know toxic effect of some medication or toxicity from something in the environment or drug they're taking whatever the thing to do about it would have been by let's say twenty or so years ago right right right exactly exactly when\nI think intervention we have the best outcome right and that's why I'm saying testing is so important early on and frequently so that you can see changes happening\nVery early before they get to even stage one right\nOr or at least to be able to recognize that you're in stage one which would be excellent and maybe we can start to\nMake some better choices like not allow two hundred and fifty pounds line back just plowing chip\nI'm so speech behavior is the major issue they it's it's explosive behavior it's pathological jealousy and\nTremendous paranoia and they think that some that's like that's a hallmark of this right and it's something that that I think we've seen with a lot of these football players that again it was overlooked because\nYou know they were anxious maybe they had these ADHD symptoms obscene is excited they are putting some medications um they were acting out in strange ways I mean it it started to look more like you know a psychiatric or or\nOr even personality type disorder right and it was just overlook and you know a divorces occurred with a lot of these guys because\nYou know the pathological jealousy and and and and paranoia you know choosing wives and girlfriends of of things that they didn't do a you know which led to you know I'm doing crazy things maybe\nYou know a ... you know stealing something\nOr or going into a club or using some of ... shooting the gentleman was you're right in the ... very calm and you know and there's guns are being used or\nSo so it's it's overlooked as part of a disease process you know and then there's legal problems that overtake everything and and they just don't get evaluated so it's it's really sad to see there really is because\nYou know if we think about this we catch it earlier you know stop them from the the you know the head injuries\nIt's possible that we can see this from you know go to stop this from progressing have about a minute left I Want to ask if if there's is it easily capable for the self the person who was injured to identify these things happening or is it\nOr the antibodies start to form to the brain and it is it is posed right now but\nI'm the antibodies into the brain by means of this disrupted blood brain barrier and start to attack neuronal cells which are normally protected ... so it it they're they're really starting to do more and more research to their their understanding that they're not understanding how it happens right the breakdown of blood brain barrier\nSo they feel that at Boston University's a C. T. center\nFeels that they may have a a a marker that they can test in the blood that together with a PET scan a PET scan with tracer might be enough to you know and then put the symptoms together to actually make a diagnosis in somebody who's still alive\nSo that that's promising because they think the sooner we have a way to make that diagnosis\nI think the sooner we can you know ... intervene aggressively right because you know you can go to all you can say to a football player listen I don't want your plane anymore which is only my first year in a third yeah random like yet but you understand you keep playing like this\nYou're either going to die from a head injury directly or you're going to maybe in your thirties or forties you're going to start\nOr you're going to maybe in your thirties or forties you're going to start to lose all neurologic function overtime and become more and more\nA I'm a ... a but I'm getting scouting right yeah and that's the problem is the prom and these guys know they're worth a lot of money I get I mean but you really kind of look at it you know both Jackson said I think it was twenty six Seventeen he said if he knew what happened\nYou know with these chronic ah ... concussions and head injury he never would have played\nAnd because of it he doesn't want his own kids play so says a lot you know when it's easy for him to say that now we are as he got the problem and you can now say those kids know right but it's hard you know put him back to when you know is this starting days when he was as talented as he was\nThere was almost no way to stop the guy you know what I mean he knew any knew he was worth the money he knew he was a great player\nSo how do you intervene there without some really good data and say listen you keep doing this\nYou're going to be dead and let me tell you something the average life expectancy of a pro football player is fifty six that's seems low it's not okay I mean it is look yes but it's not inaccurate that number is accurate media because\nAnd and actually with more and more of these players killing themselves in younger and younger ages actually\nThat number's going to come down because the majority of these guys die that football players die of heart related issues because they don't take care of themselves you know they're in great shape physically for a number of years they stopped playing the keep eating like their gorillas and they broke up in fat\nYou know part of it might be because of the CD making impulsive decisions continue\nA lot of that is true yeah that's exactly right and I so so yeah right right exactly so you know it's a chicken and egg story isn't it yeah you know where to start\nAnd a lot of it can start all the way back to high school yeah all the way so you've really got to take the serious as early as possible and I again I say this is the most important thing is before you start playing any kind of contact sport you should be getting neuro psych in rural ... talkative testing\nTo have your baseline so that if you have a head injury and there's changes we have all the information we need to know that you've changed and that and and veteran back to base line and that's\nAbsolutely imperative all I'm hearing here is that we should really consider a getting more table tennis champion\nGoing I Love it I I agree I mean in boxing ... for years there was a whole crew of medical professionals that have been trying to shut boxing down completely\nThat's it's going to be hard yeah you know and but but I see the reason I mean is it it's it's a given that if you have somebody beat your head up several times during a fight that you're going to eventually have C. T. I mean one form or another so it's it's it behooves you to really think this out\nI mean it's it I'm sure it's a lot of fun to play I'm positive it is but and I'm sure it's really fun to make that kind of money but it's not fun to have CD there's nothing funny about this and these poor guys I mean some of them end up going to be able to feel stand in front of the coach and blow their own head off I mean I have a story after story that I can\nTell you that one I have not heard had not no I have not heard that that they go down to I can pick I\nSee I don't know how much time is going to have I'm not believing\nI Know say very surprised no no I I but I got a lot of stories it's fascinating is it it's but it's not in the news you don't hear it that much you know one here and there but you put it together and you look at it and and over the last you know Fifteen Years there's been\nWay too many and again these are the the fringe in extreme cases these are the people who have ended up suffering so so much that that was the decision that they chose to make and for every one of those ten twenty thirty fifty a hundred who knows how many people just living and suffering or barely living\nYeah yeah exactly that's right we don't even hear we don't even hear about him mhm maybe they've killed themselves and nobody put it together until way after they've gotten the brain they've done this study and they so they had seen the years afterwards and nobody puts it together and says you know so and so had seen the\nCensus of the puzzle just scattered over a period of twenty or Thirty years right exactly\nExactly and we're seeing a lot of changes in the NFL too and there's a lot of money that's coming up a hundreds of thousands of oh I'm Sorry hundreds of millions of dollars being set aside and\nUm we'll try to talk about that in the last part I'm\nSo prevention is the most important thing in the bottom line is prevention so better equipment or taking people out play you know are doing the neuro psych testing your cognitive testing and having that baseline and the following it and and doing it I think at least every year and then every time they have an injury it has to be done\nUm the there was his ... really interesting study that was done in animals that now we're talking about blast effect like like in a in a bomb blast\nUm and it's they they know they showed in the study that during that costs of blast if the head itself and the body or remain a mobilized and then the blast occurs that they actually don't have any ...\nAnd then the blast occurs that they actually don't have any memory loss or learning deficits but that was really interesting but they don't know why that is so that's there's ongoing study going there but it's pretty gruesome study animals blasting\nSound a little bit like but I think it might have maybe depending on the method that they're using to immobilize ahead it might have a like a sort of the way your your ground a wire ... electricity but uh you know ... pounds of steak into the ground you feel it everywhere sure sort of dispersal of force mhm\nAnd and that may be and I think that but what's interesting is you know and then they got a half months they figure out why and how than they could figure out a quip myth like you know for military recruits in a Humvee they might be able to mobilize them in a way that if there was a blast they might not suffer the same damage but that has not been\nFully vetted and and feathered it out so well if you have to be seen\nPlus you'd probably need a larger footprint that he

baseball is the intimacy it has which the fans and unlike others forge the crowd is on top of the field of play\nNBA fans can shit courtside but it's rare when you have Billy Crystal or Will Smith tripping somebody now Spike Lee's a little more complicated but in baseball the proximity\nCan cause real problems and we saw that last night we've seen that before I go back to the famous case where the cubs fan Steve Bartman interfered with his own team and two thousand three Jeffrey mare he helped facilitate of Derek Jeter home run in Nineteen Ninety six there was no replay back that last\nNight another incident that will go down in baseball history the red Sox ... stretched his glove into the crowd trying to Rob Jose out to be of a home run now I didn't catch it but the umpires ruled fan interference shelled to bay was out\nTechnically the fan being hit ... glove\nAstro fans reason to be upset today\nThere was over three minute waiting period before they finally came back and so there was fan interference there's no perfect solution for baseball and like it or not fans have always been and will always be a big part of the game now there's some solutions to this you could say\nI don't know put flower boxers there or maybe you raise the fence a little bit higher but I thought last night ... was going to make the cash I didn't think it was fan interference\nI didn't think the fan reached out over the line over the wall in my opinion\nAnd the different angles that I saw I thought that he I thought it was very close but I Do think that would have made that catch and you know the umpires Joel West so differently I normally see it differently than Joel West does so I feel like I'm In pretty good company today yeah ...\nWhat what is the exact ruling is well he will the player made the catch part of the ruling or is it just did the fan entered the field of play with his arm to interfere because\nWhat if he does that then it's on automatically fan interference because that's what's the big thing once you go into the stands\nThen that's different the fans kind of have the right away because it's in the sand yeah if you go into the stands I I don't have to accommodate you but you ... I don't think you can you know be blatant in in in heating him trying to make that catch but I I thought that ... was going to make that cut\nBut I Do think that the fan\nI don't think that was fan interference\nNow I've seen fan interference before that didn't feel like it was like yes\nI agree like they're not intentionally interfering I don't think there's anything they're just take their catching on her rumble veterans incredibly athletic place who's up the whole thing [laughter] Ninety nine percent out the others are not going to be making that that I kind of like well that would have been a crazy cat show I Would have maybe rules at home right and what if he would've caught it\nWent way down and my my normal human being would not have gone to no no\nBut I I Would have when I looked at it I thought\nThat was going to get it because the fan hits his glove and closes his glove but I think best would have gotten it but I Do think the fan was being a fan I don't think he was impeding or in the field of play yeah for two\nAnd if you look at the body language and just watching the eyes of like I guess this group of about three or four guys that had a chance to get the ball farther than they were totally locked in them that ball and not looking to see if they can squeeze that's his glove or knock him from a catchy man\nIt was a pretty incredible game last night but the Sox win an eight to six incredible catch by Ben attendee there with the bases loaded in the night if he does it make the cash they probably lose the game he was that big it goes to the wall and I think he had camp on first base you are running with two outs\nIt was to the wall and I think he had camp on first base you running with two outs\nYou're probably going to lose that gay so it was a win or lose or at least if he didn't make the catch diving for it and kept it in front of him then you still have a chance but what happened last night late in that game should not be overlooked\nUh because I think the headlines have to do with ... in his home run but the red Sox now for no on the road in these playoffs and consecutive nights they'll Jackie Bradley juniors hit a home run at a pivotal spot it uh to uh to run Homer ... go ahead homerun in the sixth inning yes by\nA according to and I'll be dot com\nWhen a spectator clearly prevents have field or from catching the ball by reaching into the or onto the field of play\nThe battle she'll be ruled out did did the guys in the outfield clearly put their arms that magic barrier of stands versus no longer in this day well what do ... what is clearly me where he has no doubt that when they make contact with his glove\nHis glove was not over the barrier of this into the stands so they have to enter the field of play with their arms yeah the fan I didn't think they did they can actually grab the glove off his hand if his arm was in the family and\nOnce you go into the siege their property then it's fair game yes according to him I'll be okay I just didn't think it was blatant um uh but I Do think best would've caught it absolutely but that doesn't factor in my guy movie effort to\nAlso think ruler not whenever Joe West called because it was so tough to decide they would have went with that he could have easily called that a home run and they would have probably just kept at a home run two two and the first thing\nYeah [noise] a Dodgers over the brewers um\nClinton Herschel seven innings allow one run three hits nice strike outs Ninety eight pitches and ... memory one of my head Dave Robertson and I said oh you're relying on the whole run too much and he said well yeah probably but we do walk a lot [noise]\nThe Dodgers drove in all but one of their runs on singles last night\nThey were the leader of the national league during the regular season with home runs they went home or lose in their third consecutive game\nAnd they're leading three games to two so\nThe Dodgers have hit only to home runs through five games of the ... three of their Twenty one runs in the series\nComing off home runs\nThank you thank you day letting in a hurry to do that even let it and so can you just heard what data\nAnd I would sell any of these younger pitchers if you want to watch somebody pitcher game watch her show last night he didn't have you know a a you know his fastball was in topping out over Ninety four was it\nA meal on rare occasions but that's when somebody pitches and it was brilliant because I don't think he he might get his fastball back next year\nAm not getting it back during the postseason but what you saw last night with somebody who pitched and that was brilliant to watch\nYou know we can talk about the brewers strategy where you have ... from one batter you know I I give Craig council credit you know he's handled his pitching staff he's not afraid of taking chances it's not a great starting stamp but they have pitched well and he got Miley coming back for a game six he had a strategy it almost worked\nBut here's the key it had to work because you're going against ... and ... after not going past the fourth inning his neck start is unbelievable\nSo we've seen this before with Clayton courage show I think Craig council new you know I'm playing with fire here scarecrow and I'm going against Russia in ... called the bluff and shut them down and did a great job with that um yeah phone\nWhen the need for senior care arises there's no place like home your loved ones should never have to give up living at home visiting angels will provide home care for your mom

in Portland but\nHis strategy for the first month of the season [noise] your phone calls people fired up over the baseball last night [noise]\nOnce again late in ... [noise]\nWhat growing up in watching baseball and falling in love with baseball when I did you saw pictures of guys when they didn't have this pitch than they\nWould try to go to another pitch and you saw that with her show he didn't have a great fastball but that breaking ball was unbelievable and I believe you could have told the brewers hey breaking ball and it didn't matter less uh but you know he he stepped up huge yeah I don't know what he's going to be like if they get to the world\nIf they get to the world series his velocity\nI Know we get caught up on velocity but sometimes when you he needs that velocity because that separates the speed pitch with his fastball and the brilliance of some of these pictures I remember baseball tonight Harold Reynolds\nAnd call rabbits one night we're looking at Johan Santana and Johan Santana had a run where he was maybe the best pitcher in baseball\nThey slowed it down and Harold said I'm going to show your two pictures\nOne is ... all one is change up he's so now I imagine you're a batter in real time as you see the arms slot 'cause a lot of times pitchers will give away with their throwing with their own one he shows me to release points which Santana one found fall one change up\nThe exact same picture\nAnd he said that's why the great pitchers are so great because you don't know what's coming and I can do that I'm sure would her shoulder go here's his fastball here's is breaking ball here's a change up and you can't tell the difference because that's what pitchers hitters are just looking for something just a little just just a hell anything\nBut watching Kurdish saw last night was a lot of fun because it brought me back to when I was younger and I'm watching somebody pitched not throw pitch and there is a big difference with a high like love and what kind of pull question do you have for me\nOkay this is appalling special if you were a fan and I would add a little twists and thought you could get away with it would you interfere on a home run that helped your team\nYeah probably\nNow if I'm reaching out in the field of play than they are going to catch me but I mean how can I disguise that now I get ... that's a good credit you can't\nWell let's say there's a pop fly down the third baseline you have a lot of time to think about it you see the guy coming and you catch the think I'm going to go for this fall because it's good for my squad like you yeah if it's your own team in the ... you got a pop fly you would probably ... arms out if you're a smart fan would you do the opposite end engaged the ball knowing hey man I could have I\nHave any comes into the stands yes yeah or if he's close to the stand and we saw that last night\nIt there there's too many cameras now after last night I'm too afraid of of getting a interference call I Would stay away what else do you okay uh we could put up as a poll was it a home run or not you want to get the consensus on that that's a possibility another option or\nWhat would you watch tonight you get the red Sox Astros\nI Believe the bronze Laker debut and the Broncos cardinal rule for me it seems easy\nI'd watch LeBron yeah you have to watch [laughter] yeah I don't think I think he'd watch all three easily but ah but you only get to pick one\nYeah no I'm saying but uh yeah I Know sample [laughter] but uh [laughter] uh\nYou got to the ... the number one choice they're the only they only do scolded McClellan was just saying why are they are that the concept where we're going\nYeah yeah you only get to watch one to one of three ... three you know the truth is you can\nWatch a baseball game catch to movies and about three other games with no problem to flip back\nHey I was doing that last night I'm flipping all around and watch an NBA much in baseball I watched a modern day St John Bosco high school game from over the weekend\nWhat [laughter] so he wasn't live no watching California high school finance\nI was but the answer to the best teams in the country and an flip it around and want to see how good these quarterbacks are a one and I believe is going to be a star maybe both are going to be stars but those are two great programs I'm flipping around all of a sudden I'm watching a quarter of modern day I'm watching the second quarter modern day St John Bosco\n... where do you play the Broncos at Cardozo ... watch ability wise might be ugly [noise]\n\n[noise] it's it's not high on my my viewing pattern tonight but I'm curious to see how case Kim does I'm curious how that cardinal defenses I Want to see Josh Rosen you know sort of a prime time coming out let's see how Josh Rosen is but\nI get the feeling you know\nThings go down through the Broncos you might have a coaching change and maybe I have a quarterback change\nSo it might be the aftershocks of the game and not the game itself ... plus you had them into the high school girls volleyball chai positive tonight if I if I Need to watch it and I might I might breeze through there on direct TV you go into the six hundreds there's so much there\nAnd I think you know I'm watching replay and sometimes you know I like ... years of games but then

I watched him too [laughter] I feel bad for a little Kemba Walker little legs out there and you know and I'm forty one didn't know how\nFinally got confirmation because I told you this little brunch day they were trading for Kemba Walker and I kept saying you know the person who told me this is not going to lie to me and last night um onto the broadcast and they go you know if a liberal minded or stayed the Cavaliers were going to trade for a walk I go what\nWait what\nAnd then I go oh okay All right fine not that that matters to Kemba Walker Lubrano or the NBA right now but they wanted to get Kim ...

game plan is going to be [noise]\nBut I'm sure he does have a game plan\nAnd my thought is that first month of the season is\nLet those play everybody kind of find their way without LeBron dominating because we would see there's sometimes where you'd watch the cabs and everybody would wait around for LeBron to do something I think it's important to have everybody go about doing your job do stand around waiting for a number on or watching LeBron\nI think this is where you need to force the issue you're going to be up tempo we know that but don't wait for Braun to bail you out there's going to be lawsuits there's going to be ... slums there's gonna be confusion there'll be down\nGo out there and play nervous players when they played with Michael Jordan would be nervous because if you made a mistake Mike would give you the look and they call it the look you know LeBron's the opposite\nNow he might trains you but if you're on the floor he he wants everybody to be involved\nIn me and it makes LeBron better because I I Want coups meant to be a weapon anger him to be more of a weapon Alonzo ball which Ron does we're all going to be you know all of these players\nGo out there you have a role to play instead of saying hey you know LeBron might get this feeling and maybe in his home debut against the rockets he might want to put on a show in front of LA I I understand that but that's not what I Want\nI mentioned that if I'm lukewarm and I got unlimited miniature I really have to be aware of that and looked said yesterday that's what he's going to do\nI gotta I gotta monitors minutes here because I'm not trying to win a championship in October or November or December but can I compete for one in March April get ready for that and that would be my goal but you want to see growth\nIf they make the playoffs as a you know five six seven seed I'd be fine with that if I'm a Laker fan if I see progress they're entertaining to watch and I feel like there there's a core there\nThat's the important part don't try to dominate and do it all one night apple\nCould you see a lot with a brown are really the first three quarters of games he's different differing differing and then they're not belonging anybody out probably not blowing a lot of things out where he has to do his thing and the fourth quarter that becomes like the first month and he's and three quarters for you or a quarter for him\nYeah but I don't want him to feel like he has to take over a game but they do need when they do but but I I think that you can have these games that you may not win on the scoreboard but you're still winning by these players contributing I Want you to grow I Want you to be better I don't\nYou know LeBron can stunk it grows a little bit\nYou know Kevin Love it took him a while to figure out what he was supposed to do Chris Bosh in Miami it took him a little while to figure out what to do because with LeBron ... there's no other player like him\nAnd how you play with him or how he plays with you is a learning process and it's going to take these but keep in mind Ingram and ball who's when they got there she whenever they wanted to\nNow the brawn comes to town now much different when do I get to shoot my shooting too much am I making sure LeBron has the ball those liberal and want to be the guy who's handling the ball\nIs Alonzo ball when he's in the game what's that mean from abroad or Rondo a is LeBron gonna be a point forward it sometimes so there's so much that it's going to be involved in this\nThat you just don't want him to go he doesn't need to put on forty five I got I don't want to see forty five\nI'd love to see twenty out on the brawn but I got five guys other five of the guys and double figures yeah I'm a club\nI saw a column in the
