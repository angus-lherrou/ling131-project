C.\nAnd there are reports that a package was sent to the time Warner center which is where CNN is headquartered in that building is being evacuated to get an idea of where are you go with an investigation like this and\nHow you sort of when things seem to be spinning out of control we're really really privileged to have one of the finest law enforcement professionals\nProfessionals in American history quite frankly on the line with us now he is the former New York city police commissioner actually the longest ever serving a New York city police commission as well as many other uh an incredible positions he's held in law enforcement give me a great deal of pleasure to welcome commissioner Ray Kelly ... thanks for taking a few minutes this morning\nFrank and good luck with your bank ...\nWell it it you know it has the added virtue of being true I I Am curious you know we're seeing that the ... the FBI is investigating the secret service is investigating and the finest police department in the world the NYPD\nHow do you get when you're in\nCharge the NYPD and you have to work with other massive agencies like there's how do you even begin the logistics of a coordinated effort like this\nWell there is a structure in place because the joint terrorism task force which is essentially an FBI entity that has about art in twenty NYPD investigators in it or closer together they've worked yeah ... ... every day this type of situation would be handling necessarily\nBy the NYPD they have the bomb squad there on the ground\nThe federal government as wouldn't have these types of resources available you know all over the all of the country so this will be initially as far as the bomb is concerned the NYPD or a fair way have it's horrific bomb squad they probably have large burns that involves what\nAh in the country what they what they doing now is obviously assessing the device\nItself ... they've already I'm sure X. rated\n... is a possibility with active devices are using something called up awarded disrupt the to\nSort of a do it this is a is this a naval it or make certain that will go off and it they will take this device whatever it is to in a self contained vehicle it's a big um harden truck\nThat is is built specifically to transport bomb they'll take this divide and they'll bring it to the Rodman neck\nPolice firing range where it will be detonated but of course they'll want to gather as much evidence as possible before that happened so it looks like there's been a pretty ordinary envelope looks that gets a pipe bomb of this or they want to get\nThrough your friends all the envelope as possible and want to get DNA is somebody actually lick the envelope got ... votes sort of thing or how to be addressed before the that they should\nTake place but it's done very very carefully of court\nA Jew final questions and then I Know\nI'll let you go but uh I'm being inundated with rumor after room or a unproven fact after Ron proven fact callers are emailing me or or college or calling people are emailing me about reports of a a suspicious package\nTend to the White House as well we're informed that's not true there were reports that a suspicious package was sent to Governor Cuomo this morning where we understand that's not true how difficult does it make up the next few hours\nWhen you have all these rumors flying around which seemed to spread a lot faster and the social media area than they did Eighteen years ago\nYeah right the world has changed and there's a lot more information out there uh yeah it's difficult you have to respond to the ones that have some\nData of credibility to the I think it's important for public buildings and almost all of them have they caught a cold to do it to conduct a search of the building to see if there's any suspicious packages the public ... locations train station that sort of thing I'm I'm sure a lot of this is going on\nBut it's sort of a self help of an issue that has to take place look in your own space to see if there's anything that uh that around the suspicion but you're right that\nYou know law enforcement these days is dated with copy cat calls or people who just want to be a disruptive and it it it takes a lot of time and effort to dispel effect\nAnd finally commissioner I'm a Jew or we would you be pretty certain not that you're involved in this investigation but if the facts are true that they were similar packages sent to the Obamas the Clintons and to CNN [noise] um is there any doubt in your view that this is a coordinated effort by some wanders some group\n\nBut I think it depends on the device itself I'm sure a bomb squad and Westchester and in a Washington D. C. N. N. Y. P. they've all been talking this type of this nation is out there looking at the ...\nAnd the laws we use some of them are apparently or sent through the mail others that are dropped off so uh ... we want to get\nAs much information as you can eat specific incident to see if there's a link it just says there's connectivity and that's precisely what's going on I'm sure are going on but certainly as well as we speak I wouldn't say you know you could also have this kind of a copy of this girl but one person\nLoves it and it might trigger other people to do or is this something simple it all in the next now that's what's being examined\nCommissioner thank you very much for taking the time this morning until we spoke with you\nThat this ... thank you\nThank you [laughter] this is my Gallagher show I I Am Frank Miranda we're going to continue with wall to wall analysis we'll bring you all the break is breaking news will try and dispel some rumors I Will take your calls at one eight hundred six five five Mike and commissioner Bernie Carrick also the NYPD will join me after we come back this is my ... show I'm Frank Morris of life from New York City\n[noise]\nButcher boxers the way that you get a freezer full of meat delivered to your home every month I'm Talking state beef Shannon chicken it's out of this world it's the it's all delivered guaranteed to be mainly raves grass fed and crash\nFinished beef and its show good it's it's delicious mouth watering\nFree drink cuts in quality that you cannot find in stores and I love the competitive pricing you'll get a month's worth of delicious meat from butcher box for less than six bucks meal six dollars a meal under six bucks you'll never find a better deal with this I Want you to try to put your box\nYourself again they're offering you a great offer a great deal twenty bucks off\nAnd free bacon what's your first butcher box when you sign up today just go to butcher box dot com slash Mike jeep butcher box dot com slash Mike gee we're Colin ... eight eight eight nine three oh eight one three nine eight eight eight nine three oh eight one three nine don't delay this offer ensure\nMy leg or here's the latest trying to say whether\nHe many golden valley mostly sunny today with high ground Seventy seven might rain tonight and I was around fifty\n...

go hog water wild on\nOver there already are you you know you hear people rushing to blame or either the Democrats are the Republicans for not certainly not the terrorists\nAre asleep right that doesn't help anybody\nThat what we we need to find out who did it with number one number two if the devices or will they need to prosecute that person to the next to the fullest extent of the law and seven and eight sample Caruthers that may do this I'm the one they're going to get caught until\nYou're going to go to prison for over ... ... this is attempted murder these things are real\n... and we're also seeing apparently the device that we send to CNN was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan I'm with that that that the caviar you gave him these things around and people are just tuning in my Gallagher show him Frank Reynolds sitting in for my Gallagher from New York City while my traveling this hour\nFormer New York city police commissioner Bernard Carrick a free kind enough

terms\nOf the likely perpetrator or perpetrators and what does that mean in terms of what sort of criminal penalties he's finishing\nWhile the criminal criminal penalties will be there for him to of course you know these devices are real explosive devices that can be charged with attempted murder 'em in in some capacity I Would imagine I'm plus all the you know the the transportation mail stuff

court function of locating inclined than the people responsible doing this\n[laughter] and then finally commissioner I also while we have you on the line I Can't resist at taking advantage of your expertise in your experience having worked in a Saudi Arabia or we've all been following the coverage and the investigation into the disappearance and death of\n... um apparently the Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman today a sad that this was a killing was a crime painful\nTo all Saudis and cold and unjustifiable\nOr or you know ... pardon me commissioner for being flippant but this is ... reminds me of a child who killed his parents and then complains about the fact that he's an orphan\nI I mean if if this guy wasn't responsible who watch\nUm you know frankly I I wrote a piece or you know when this happened I predicted you know what happened I was a hundred percent right you don't have four\nMen from his intelligence bureau assigned to his protect the detail\nThat goes on a mission to like this and basically kills a guy named the lights and ah you know this numbers of cuts up the body gets rid of it um without his authorization\nThere is no way anybody that's lived or worked in that arena\nThose guys wouldn't go to the bathroom without getting authorization they're not gonna go on some\nSecret covert mission\nTo eliminate some reporter that the government like and not tell the guy that they report directly to that's not happening so people are naive to think otherwise um then listen as far as the crown prince of what he's saying what's he's supposed to say\nYou know he got caught got caught they're gonna have to deal with it um the bad thing for us is the president's going to have to deal with is unfortunately we're in a position where Saudi Arabia is sort of a lynchpin to Middle East peace\nDealing with the Iranian problem dealing with counter terrorism um oil reserve issues I mean you can't just say\nOil reserves issues I mean\nYou can't just say we're going to stop talking to the Saudis you know for the political leaders of Washington it's up here's the deal with that garbage they know behind that political with that you can't just stop talking to the Saudis\nAnd the king's son the crown prince the number two of the country to talk of the step that\nThat's going to happen so get over it figure out what you're going to do about it and

person you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely no how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be of I I consider her to be a very powerful which and um she introduced me to magic\nAnd instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um but I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and taught me how to do it myself so\nI just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident\nWith with what I Do you know with the spell that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like I probably don't need a healer because I'm\nI'm using magic as a form of healing\nHave you ever cast a spell on somebody never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] not what\nI don't know ... what what what what good are spells that if you can't win anything\nYou know I think that the power of\nOur mind because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in my mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual London so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on money spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what are you what are we talking about there we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we absolutely\nAnd it can be used by anyone I think people you know use\nAnd magic can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic\nEvery single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply chanting to spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just chanting\nSaid resigned really that long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing for\nJimmy and ... just want to get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise in my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like this magical persona so all the negative negative beans leave this house like what we can say what is it I Know it I Know it I Know it I'm just a little nervous George\nWhat are you nervous for talking millions of people write about it\nSo excited though I'm Still when I exercise my house because I Do do a house exercises and every single month to keep out the entities and any you know opportunists that\nHappened to be sure crossing by and I will say on negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I cast you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charged salt water and the candle and every\nSingle corner of my home and it really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the ceiling and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chat spells like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning absolutely\nI think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we have I mean we have given our power away\nTo not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we were just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we've we feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why Mick stream Lee grateful that my ... didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your ... demons Savage I have I have um you fight them off or do you do\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story to my demons later [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience\nAnd I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real live demon men this wasn't like a portal ... was in my house and it came out and you know want it to play it was actually a demon that was something up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhich is a little upset I said is it ... is a religion and um they need to be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset\nOr some sort of you yes on ... it's a religion or check\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the Audi shots which are different spirits\nAnd so this ... that'll had sent a intentionally of course the sent a demon my way and this was after I had had a reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I didn't know anything about the cold or anything about metaphysics I was just you know whatever just living my life\nAnd I that same even in that same day in the

practice in which the good which groups or rent unreal on her website is linked up at ... dot com right now we'll get to your calls in just a second with her courses so we're talking about this demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well what was happening\nAt that point I was ten down on my bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know if his paw\nOr a hand split\nBut it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I\nI Need that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just\nSwarmed up when I went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone but it just like it flew away obviously that's freaky\nIt is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't have believe me\nBut I did go back to that psychic woman I'm like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man is something that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me it was\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that it's a house\nWell you know I'm not going to list the say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shine yeah we're we're going to the ... cemetery at\nYou know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have to tackle which uh which should have a tackle you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a wage but yeah I think you [noise] um\nI kinda wanted a ... but that's all right\n[laughter] they can do it and even if I tried and so one of the reasons\nThat I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we've all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them um some of these lifetime so we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof for my Sherman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma\nSo they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in his lifetime\nUm the demon that is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually\nHe's he's usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you've like slang\nDashed them all but they don't exactly\nThere's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at George it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reach incarnate and the demon is going to probably harassed them and molest him now that's\nOne one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of the people\nWho are being molested harassed\nAnd just you know that possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so what she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants corrosion what what are they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians\nWill cast spells against people who they feel they can steal like from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent\nSo this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions and people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate or thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California started heart yeah go ahead\nHi George how

thing about this is it's really interesting history\nThe people who manufactures its board\nSent a letter along with the board to president Grover Cleveland force for for his wedding gift and this I\nFor Cleveland force for for his wedding gift and won't do this I Know we know this because they took the opportunity to send that vaccine letter over to the Boston Globe who got published I mean there are matches the PR yeah now what do you think president Cleveland did\nWell I Would guess she kept the board\n[laughter] well listen as we said that letter comes to him and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by expressed today an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention called though which board\nPresident Cleveland highly wrote back and said I knowledge with thanks\nThe which board which you sent me as a wedding present I accept it as an evidence of ... feeling and friendship and Kim ... fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I needed to be tested powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nWhen he did take it I knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board is but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and they are now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman\nGot together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named and talk about this woman here her name is mishandling Peters not for the\nAnd they consider her a gift psychic and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device it's spelled out we job\nThey they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know I mean I don't know you if that thing there could spell out my name\nIs George what do you think happened ... and sure enough in the ... came alive\nNo didn't spell out his name was somebody on the planet ... where he probably would have accused him of doing something or did it work by itself you\nKnow you got to have your hands on the plants that have led\nYeah you have to so it started out they didn't know him and it it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not for the uh it's really critical of crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent it and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it's we were honoring her just last month in uh Denver, Colorado and they were beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard at are buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and\nAnd now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called the Fairmont cemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of all read you board the proper way he felt and it was to burn it\nAnd he said as she was burning you could see little ... coming off it and screamed she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions beliefs\nOn how we view the world her own fears or own desires and so I don't mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even\nTruly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even a factor worlds to create in er manifest yet\nI'm going to say that's a story but what I Will comment on some board don't work very well because it might be made out of ... a night and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... you could have sent to us\nAt the ... society will take them and we'll refurbishing and selling it given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nSharing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest for the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got 'em roughly ... started being made in Nineteen Ninety One in production minds one year after that\nHow do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my ... show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've read a producer there\nAnd this we gee board is in the studio with me and I never had any technical issues with the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong ...\nIn the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors you know my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out or didn't know what was on what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know what the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl in hot word game Darryl\nLuigi board he said that George wants us you try to get and so he took it as a gift I didn't know that and um\nYou know I did much shorter than work ... I was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station\nWhich which kind of strange what he's gone and I want for that is weird uh again not knowing that he had the ... board I I run into him about a week and a half later is at a\nRestaurant and I went Darryl how're you I'm sure you've heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me the ... board\nI got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job I I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that care\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there than to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning well I you know we want to blame that we've all by something that you want to make a mysterious you don't want to look at something logically first it was ironic that it's very ironic I but I have to\nGive you that George but I got to say we we we ... the ... for it because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to board did it but that happens too often 'cause it's almost easier again is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the reason out now hold on his way to think about the two\nWe create a lot of things we could just have the thought in her mind that a ... it's scary dangerous fad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our mind this one power of unconscious mind and then spin around and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\n[noise] I don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the review board\nI Know and that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it oh that it can conjure up evil spirits let's say I'll say that\nYou can conquer anything evil in your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil is and people they're evil all over the world look around it's people cause evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have equal things happens and they are real bad evil things\nDoesn't see me just because you get a piece of wood outer cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool\nAnd away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose to find\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to use it I the best thing to do it's not gonna don't do that because they're going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what do you what do you think about it what do you like about what do you want to know\nThat I Want it goes to come through her that they want they want they want kids like the stuff of course\nSome adults do too I mean look up ... those shows are permanent investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well if it goes ... what's that going to do for you how's your life going to be and how the conversation\nI don't know where that conversation is going to go and it may go where you decide to for example I live in southern Cal you may decide to go take a child that Queen Mary and go up on one of their investigation\nOr hold on for a second term will come back\nTalk more and we'll take phone calls next\nThe independence and wellbeing new with critical Health News dot com that's critical Health News dot com Julie Leslie feel out the Howard group\nWith my fourth and our ... director of operation it was overwhelming running game being yellow it than cutting\nIt was overwhelming running again today and being below it while I'm hooked on the job I linked then it was impressive but what really connected with me was how passionate Oscar was about ... logical as operations\nWe started discussing excel that led to process blows databases child development when you interview became and he got ...

from when we came up where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between live\nAnd so I I came into this world as a very young child scene spirits having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections and continue throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my a gateway or becomes just the channel I use to do what I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nThat sounds we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting in a way that this was the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's myself with my ... my beliefs about those abilities\nMy allowance of abilities to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact\nWith them how often do you use the board not as much as I used to undo it a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often than he is the board\nBut I use the board would say about once every two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month but I I prefer to work with a partner at part as a very busy probably schedule himself would we do get together we'll do a session on my last anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I do live shows

answer people's questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody Frisco\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do it\nYeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I

door at the screen door opened\nAnd there was no way can open so we jumped up and when ... when the doors are locked it\nAnd just started shutting all the windows because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in well the next day he called me cause for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last\nNight I came home and you\nWere on me at that that that I get rid of the weeds you look at things a grudge\nUn gee that's an I I Love when she shared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher cells you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's it's what it is it's really too you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and these are these other dimensions of a person so I don't want that doubt that you can do that I as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad end to

often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we have I mean we have given our power away\nTo not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we're just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we we feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so\nThis is one of the reasons why in extremely grateful that my ... didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you ... it is indeed magical when it works is\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your ... demons average I have I have um you fight them off what do you do with it\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story that might have even Slayer [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive demon men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and it came out and you know want it to play it was actually a demon that was something up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's on the medal I said I said is ... is a religion and um they need to be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset\nOr shut down the you yes ... it's a religion or ...\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the already shots which are different spirits\nAnd so this song battle had

just a second with her courses so we're talking about the demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well what was happening\nAt that point I was ten down on my bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I felt that on my ear going up and down I don't know if there's a pall\nOver a half foot\nBut it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down so this wave of courage just\nCame over me and I just thought you know I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind right I said I'm going to fight the felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just swung up when I went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy\nLeg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it's flew away obviously\nThat's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't have believe me\nBut I did go back to that psychic woman and look like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man is something that came in and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me who\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that to help ...\nWell you know I'm not going to list the say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shame yeah we're we're\nGoing to the ... or the cemetery at you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany either way you ever to laugh you don't have a capital which uh which should have a capital you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you um\nAre kind of wanted a ... but that's all right\n[laughter] I Can't do it even if I tried\nAnd so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we've all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remember any of them on some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof from ... who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this and it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the team and the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime\nAnd the dean of the past is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually along\nIs usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you like slate\nJosh them all but they don't exactly there's\nThousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reach incarnate and the demon is going to probably harassment molest him now that's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my ... has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past lives and nail it\nAnd nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are the dark for she wants to ... ... what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nBeat also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal like from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions and people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding,

to share my information\nAnd you were considered to be a good which aren't you\n[laughter] well I I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely know how to dissolve start for you how did you get involved and witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be of I I consider to be a very powerful which and um she introduced me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing\nUm but I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me she empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself\nSo I just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spell that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like I probably don't need a healer because I'm\nI'm using magic as a form of healing\nHave you ever cast a spell on somebody never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\n... what what what what good are spells that if you can't win and he's\nYou know I think that the power of our minds\nBecause I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in my mind is more powerful than I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels\nThat we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual London so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on money spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the um healing and crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what are you what are we talking about there we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply cantina spell\nAnd when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say really that long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing forgive\nMe and then second chance just or get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kinda fun 'cause you have to put on like this magical persona so I'll say a negative\nBecause you have to put on like this magical persona so I'll say a negative negative beans leave this house wait what was it what is it I Know I Know it I Know I'm just a little nervous George\nWhat are you nervous for talking millions of people right\nExcited them I'm Still when I exercise my health because I Do do\nA house ... every single month to keep out the entities and any you know opportunists that happened to be sure crossing by\nAnd I will say on negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I test you out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charged salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and it's really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the feelings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun\nIt's really really fun and then when I when I chat spells like when I Do when crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and you do it very often and I'm a real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we have I mean we have given our power away\nTo not only our friends and family but to the government and it you know we just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we we feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so\nThis is one of the reasons why I'm extremely grateful that my sharman didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works is\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your careers are ... demon shepherd I have I have um you fight them off where do you do with her\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a sword and Maya demons layer well it's it's not as tragic as that but I have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive demon men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and it came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's a ... or send us in the ... is a religion and um they can either be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset\nOr some sort of you yes on ... it's a religion or ...\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the ... shots which are different spirits\nI'm so this song federal had sent a intentionally of course the sent a demon my way and this was after I had had her reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I didn't know I

turned off my life so I Can't even blame it on a train as soon as I turned off my light [noise] um I was pinned down to my bed [noise] and I was terrified I didn't even know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was just like\nI couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know after a few words my job locked

we'll get to your calls in just a second with her courses so we're talking about the demonic situation and you said it wasn't going well what was happening\nSo I Would point I was pinned down on my bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know of as a pall\nOver half split\nBut it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was pinned down\nSo this wave of courage just came over me and I just thought you know I I I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I\nI made that adjustment in my mind I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just peeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just\nSwung up when I went up and I'm not\nKidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously that's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't have believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman them up like what happened\nBut yeah it's so freaking and I will say and never happen again after that time so I Know that this man is something that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me who\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and and she was like\nWell you know I'm not going to list that say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shame yeah\nWe're we're going to the ... cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a tackle which uh which should have a tackle you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you um\nAre kind of wanted a ... [laughter] I can do it even if I\nTried 'em so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand\nI'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them um some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof for my showman who kind of confirmed um ... you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the\nDanger act with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in his lifetime um the demon the pay is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you've like slate\nCast them all but they don't exactly there's\nThousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reincarnate and the demand is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's one one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my ... has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of the people who are being ...\nHas a lot of cases of of people who are being molested harassed and just you know that possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past lives and nail it\nAnd nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants corrosion what what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic more hope and so this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf the demon intrusions in people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate or thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California together started I guess go ahead\nHi George

more\n[noise] you don't hear about um what do you don't know\nOn the other hand I Would say the great majority of people but ... the notion that this herbal life out there some of them might be coming here and when you find out\nHow many planets there are that came with a great shock through a lot of people one point six planets superstar you gotta be crazy and that may be conservative ... yeah ... that may not letting them X number\nBut it changes are ... by the rich should change our perspective about ourselves and also\nThe age of the system you know we're not talking about the life began a

waiting for the next step behind beyond nuclear fusion but there's a heck of a contrast between you know burning would have no fire burning coal ah two nuclear fission a nuclear\nFusion and ... naturally being the kind of ... through your weight on how to use a lot of energy for killing hey we're due for a device\nOn column atom bombs column H bombs et cetera but we're also\nLearning where

of the energy available for the benefit of mankind ah one power to take power for ... from getting\nPower and we've got some lessons to learn a we teach our children but you can always have what you want a much as it might be nice for you and may not be nice for some other people who will do you interviewed or trying to do them\nSo it is fortunate that we have and have a a great more imagined the

so\nThat's a sign of hope restraint\n[noise] gosh I Hope so passion I Hope to David my you know David Jacobs right Oh yes no them for a long time\nAnd David ... is a believer that whatever's happening here it's not a good thing that there's you know some evil evil ... interview you wouldn't even think about\nWell I Can't prove to you but there are not you know he's out there on the other hand I have to point out\nUh you don't have to be much more advanced than we are to be capable of destroying a lot of ... ... if you put your mind\nAnd isn't it amazing that we haven't done a couple of thousand nuclear warheads sitting around the world and none of them the the news that's remarkable\nIt is shown restraint I'm not saying that makes us great guy but it's the first step toward good

in the early sixties\nAnd you know it got a ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard\nOf what's going on ... you got to have people who can handle the heat's speak it's unfortunate

prove or brand and sheep blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window\nAnd there were campus is like ...\n... if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's coda a mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of I hearty courageous a mild still still has that frontier feeling well the the ... not very popular a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair\nAnd that's just general fairness in the cabinet ideal just wasn't fair and I think most people just law that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and and I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her\nEverything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she's really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stick so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a professor poured then she\nDidn't believe him but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned often noticed his demeanor you know just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota law that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nThen media has had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias\nAnd it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people should peroxide frenzy and fury and upset and and the left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with me get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than a one lesson that you\nYou know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um congressman in North Dakota or what lesson did you share with others who are listening across the country about\nAbout that period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep the prosperity going out into the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is ...\nLet's return to a respect for states you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states I Would consider bad states at places like California\nNorth Dakota is the second leading producer oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously technology to unlock it\nBut but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nStates' rights and and that's what would have got to read cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you'll have a much better country in my view\nUm congressmen finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices and some critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought his let's please not jump to conclusions let's you know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's\nPlease not jump to conclusions stretch\nHere this is why some twenty four hours ... watch which calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of his speech before we create something different than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self

stamped\nAssault well hot\nYeah it is a harder you would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean are there has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service the who who were they picked it up where they got it and how they got there\nNow if it's an inert

wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send up pipe bomb like this through\nThe postal service because it's too easily detected it's or anything to that\n[laughter] well I mean if you look or you know historical data the uh bombs have been put used you know through

or whatever but if you're gonna do you're not going to use what they used in the last few days but you're going to use something that's not detectable I'm looking at this again refer back to the FedEx

we don't know exactly what went down a with a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign\nOr it's heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santa

wasn't land developer it turns out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him\nAnd it looks like he had walked right into the trap and I thought he could get away with lying about it I don't\nTo me the whole thing is it's very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text

tribal here's what bothers me you know we have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across the border and there are ways to deal with it but you know what we're born in America\nWhere we you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not me born in Guatemala doubt they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us\nThat we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children we got to start putting ourselves into shoes or other people\nSo what does John Case it propose that we become Guatemala [noise]\nThat we have to feel so guilty that we\nWeren't born in Guatemala that other people were\nWe need to just welcome everybody who's marching in a big group cross the border or you don't notice how we never offers any solution oh we'll we'll deal with that he says\nIn other news that we actually have to cover on the show beyond\nA allowing one freak to dominate the news cycle of this caravan continue this way up and\nUp north and it broke early this morning that general Madison is expected to send the eight hundred more troops to the southern border\nA defense secretary Mattis expected to sign a deployment order a that could send eight hundred or more troops to the border with Mexico to help border patrol authorities stopped this caravan the official tells CNN final details are being worked out including where the troops will come from and their specific tasks\nNot yet clear if part or all of the new deployment will be federally activated National Guard forces or in fact active duty troops the troops will not engage in lethal operations to stop the migrants [laughter] instead they're expected to provide fencing\nWall materials and other technical support oh that's ... that's going to work at several points along the border where does believe the migrants may try to cross\nThe troops will also provide tents and medical care for border authorities in those areas\nThe troops retain the right\nAh as it says of self defense\nBut border patrol officers will still be the one physically stopping illegal migration\n\nThe troops are expected to be in position next week this deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort along the border to support border authorities with other technical\nA feed\nMe down here what are you in your book ... what are you doing in my room and your sense of ... it's been a long time since he had an adventure for mom to bring to the force last year and it's that's keeping it took me a long time to get here you're right I should get out yeah the first is not that far away hey come to the forest\nWhere the more adventurous you let's check out discovered the force dot org for cool places nearby brought you by the U.S Forest Service and the ad council\nHow do we get a diagnosis one of the stages of its when someone in your life as old timers\nThan a day goes by that you have questions we need full time care or they're in treatment so many questions where do you start how willing where can I get extra help\nAll tremors dot Gov\nReliable resource for information about old timers and related to mention what happens next where can I find the answers store here\nYou know the kids still do\nA triple\nDouble five of them were white [noise] call Laura now one eight five five forty Laura\n[noise]\n\n\nI spend a lot forty eight out what was it was all these immigrants and by the way they are not criminals there no terrorists doesn't have you been in the refugee [noise]\nCriminals for me\nIt's not that many I mean this is a good before he used to\nCost too much to do that but that doesn't mean that everybody is\nWhy I mean why wouldn't people come to think about it [noise]\nThey know they can stay they know they just have\nTo show up and they're going to be given a asylum interview they state they have credible fear they give it a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists\nAnd then they get waved into the country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nSo why wouldn't all of Guatemala\nAnd El Salvador and Honduras eventually figure out a way to get to the border and come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then they have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported\n\nSo we're making it an obvious choice for people who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't get leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost\nTo illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people who are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them are children who then have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals and the lion share or not but they are here and they're not going anywhere\nSo the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border at this point\nIn my ... I mean you could see the art and it's just easier at this point we don't have a border\nOkay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a great\nPiece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday and the reason for this is that\nMost illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market first end because black American a labor force it's so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas\nWhere illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skilled black workers\nIt's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers'\nWages are under cut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fix Social Security numbers and African Americans\nAre in other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with this it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four\nAnd I will tell you this a rounded Santas is the only choice for Florida oh we're going to play the sound from a last night's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely and I played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and\nThose who seek political favors are political consideration which that should in of itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming rates of course for any question about his ethics so we'll play the race card a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\nTo or do you bring it up as Andrew Gillum gets elected I'm going to have to leave Florida with like she'll that's that's just the first point what felt\nLike I said about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking and people will take them into is all\nThat of all those people are ... states and they want to be part of us without carrying American flags while they are carrying flashing their own country slugs around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to take what we have looked at it for us\nAlong some excellent points are carrying the Honduran flag other blue flag that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flags\nOn the Democrats and others has trouble or ... why haven't authority has given us more information about what's in these packages such a good question people are asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing and the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nI think a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempt at terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copy cats and so forth so I understand that as well\nUh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma\nTheresa welcome\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly ask how much of your personal time in your personal many do you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I have all ideas it's not very\nIn causes and helping your fellow man I have all ideas it's not very much it's just the soundbite for them and they really have no care for those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor individuals who apply for legal of\nEntry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially\nAccountable for them and also civil reliable if they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up I mean we know they enforce\nTheir their perimeter around their house with alarms and fences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Kades tickets taken into his own uh his own you know governor's mansion and Im sure you can take in a few it's pretty nice house\nIt's a great point All right you're listening to the lord anger show a very tight race\nIn Indiana and we're going to talk to Mike ... a bronze who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points\nSo this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about Indiana as a ... it's a reliably red state many a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came for all of course a should also not be a Republican strong conservative\nAnd what what Indiana's think today\nExcuse discourse ... excuse me for the Democrats are\nIncumbent senator or governor I'm Still have governor on my mind a so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race but I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break a five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political timing is very strange and a lot more coming out\n\n\n\n\nTime she runners maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your

sixty six Laura that's eight five five six six Laura or go to resort released dot com\nAnd Missouri and we feel real good about it a momentum everything on our side and I really believe we're going to win\nSo your opponent says like well he supports Trump to does he\n[laughter] well all the stuff that doesn't count a\nVoted against tax reform and you know it was for Obamacare all the stuff that's really important he's a hundred percent lined up with Chuck Schumer and the liberal side of his party and\nThat record being fully flushed out here uh through this campaign and that's the reason we're going to win it with or without the capital\nYou know Bob but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we restore strict competitively in great fundraising and not a whole lot different than executing a business plan and we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or and what what is your take on this that the criticism of the president was almost instantly even though he condemned that's of course and asked for national unity it was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these a package is being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge but for the main thing he's done the reason I'm running as\nA wouldn't be running and it's a it's been a rather outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity to kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still really litigating I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets\nNo credit for the great agenda that's out there that's a\nExciting Hoosier Z and he was popular in sixteen hair or among conservatives and even more so\nAnd I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh I think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly is try to become so proper you when you don't eat ever a you know he's been always with the liberal side of his party's\nBut he never um you know he's been always with the liberal side of his party's so uh um I think this is just another example of how they try to distract than a given absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence we're seeing from the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after ... least once almost\nKilled at the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened in fact I wasn't shocked by the security they would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it's a lick me of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the capital hearings and all of his challenging Democrats in these red states or the amount of just absolute negative or lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packs dump into George Soros than the rest of 'em uh\nI think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda and\nI think voters are going to hold him accountable uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings for ... years would have been part the point where our race changed and many others and I think enough was enough and they related back to my race and many others I sell something\nFox dead on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped you on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity earned force the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to\nPersonal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade he won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about ten years ago to\nMake sure he'll be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail but your big government hooked up with big health care is specifically insurance I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd law upheld premiums flat for ten years\nAnd it's the absolute truth and\nIt's kinda blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually might have a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was\nMade of consumer driven made a transparent the kind of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the Senate I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race against the guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been\nA career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progressive results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on the heels and constantly apologizing I mean they that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like some of like a John ... forever back on the heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and and I I think it's a little\nWell Austin's pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWow I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get as this agenda\nReally heals and I talk about tax reform and I do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners value got more Django in your pocket share it with your employers we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping the plot for ten years and I've preached out all the time you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated we talked ten months people now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us that ... gone out there and touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employees\nPeople quit looking through the false hope of a federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put us on the brink of\nA financial calamity if we don't get more people in there they're going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going and there'll be more obvious\nRamifications that's why I'm going you know there'll be more opposite effect that drop on the bandwagon sticker ... joined the Trump train so\nWhat will happen well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race or the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get to the polls vote for an advancing economy an uh an America\nThat's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more ... illegal immigration got to deal with this with the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're gonna win this Mike and I'm I'm so glad or in order to win it\nThan that I'm looking forward to it and the

I don't like that word used by anybody but you don't get drunk out of society if you if you're if you're a Chris Rock because everybody knows that your motivation is not this deep hatred of racism another example it's always sunny in Philadelphia\nIs a is the longest running a live action sitcom in us history\nIt's fourteen season it's going to sign up for the fourteenth season at least once and I think twice they've done entire episode where they're white characters were in blackface\nK now their motivation as liberals right\nTheir motivation is to show that racism is really dumb and their characters are really dumb and their dressing up this way and they're showing how stupid they are and making the point that they think it's okay to dress up in blackface but they actually did it on camera multiple episodes this is a a liberal icon of our program\nOK totally okay for them to do it\nBut for her to question it and say if it's a positive motivation is that okay well I don't remember I don't remember a lot of an outcry from the left over it's always sunny in Philadelphia doing it multiple times they did an entire episode ... which is one of the greatest television\nUh episodes of any series of all time called the gang turns black\nAnd ... and they have a situation where they all wake up after getting electric or getting struck by lightning and they're all black and they have to live as black people for the day and they walk around ten minutes\nOrderly amazing but beyond that it is something that there's been no pushback on look at things like family guy you'll see the you know the animation but it's still the same types of things happen because they believe and we all kind of like well the motivation there is\nThat he he's that they're not trying to be racist an upstarting trying to say black people are inferior or anything like that they're doing this to make a point on the other side we think their motivation is good so that's okay\nWhat she's saying here is if the motivation is good let's say a child for example who thinks they want to dress up as a hero of there's a happens to be black\nAnd they don't know what I mean than the dynamics right you want to be black and white they don't understand the dynamics of blackface they would think OK well that and you think the kids not racist their motivation is they're trying to look up to a hero and that's the only point you bring up it might not even be true\nSaid the president is acting unconstitutionally talk to the other branch you need to arrest him an exile him the other branch did so two branches of the government ousted him said that's not\nWhat we do we don't want to be\nA Hugo Chavez Venezuela okay\nHe said ever since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many things try to buy a ... and his party deliberate which translates to Freedom Party\nTo destabilize our country this is just the latest stunned and ... of blame\nThis is just the latest stunned and ... blames America and has also made America is now reaping what its own type statements\nHe has said that America must take in the migrants because America has supported the current administration that he now claims has caused all of the misery that we as Hondurans are living through\nThis is why they're marching with a Honduran flag because they blame us for their misery\nThis is nothing more she writes than a strong arm tactics to embarrass both Honduras and America sadly the migrants were lied to and had been told that America must accept them in\nIn one news report a lady who was interviewed told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel once they got to Guatemala\nBut there were no buses waiting on them that I could tell from the report some of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet\nThis is really sad and frustrating because many migrants ... a has been a had been told that they will get in and they will get jobs once they arrive in America and therefore many are good with the hopes of a better life\nHowever these are types of situations that criminals are a\nMight have been the organizers of the march will take advantage of\nPlease keep spreading the truth about this situation I enjoy all of your content and you're a podcast thanks for being a truth teller in a world of lives God Bless you and the family at the blaze for all that you do\nFrom someone who lives and was born and raised in Honduras\nThat is verifying exactly what we were we're being told what we had can do you know just as\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you know I was gonna say\nYou know as reporters and then I was going to say no we're not really reporters and then thought of journalists because they're not really a journalist but then I thought of ...\nHe's a he's a journalist with the Washington Post you know and it's that everyone keeps saying I ... I think columnist would be more accurate uh well he wrote\nFive five five columns for the Washington Post that of course makes you a journalist does it ...\nFive ... I mean you'd probably written five columns on out here to have places like the rest of ... I I did something for the Washington Post at one point to the gym now you're a journalist or\nJournalists aren't doing their jobs the ... news organizations don't want to tell you what's really going on but this is what's really going on with that caravan\nUm we hope to have Michael Yon before the end of the program today to talk a little bit about what they're doing about this in the Congress and the Senate and what the president can do a and\nHow we can hold Mexico accountable and these other countries accountable if they just pass their problem on to us I feel for on doors because these guys are the guys who are causing trouble in their own country they're having to deal with these guys all the time\nAnd our press is not duped by them\nThis is why it's hard to defend the press when they say we're not an enemy of the people\nYeah yeah I I agree you're not an enemy of the people but you are definitely an enemy of the truth and whether that is intentional or you are just unbelievably a\nLacking all curiosity all natural curiosity you just start unbelievable\nIn how a daddy inside you are on trying to find anything other than what people are just telling you in the next cubicle what'd you all just or agreeing on\nOh look at this bombs come in there's ten of them none of them have gone off they're they're they're not even\nPipes their their PVC pipes that defeats the reason of having a pipe bomb you want the shrapnel of the middle of the pipe as it blows up\nWhile yes but they put glass inside a black glass is not the same as ball bearing you put metal not glass you put metal in these things\nPlus\nThe wires are on the outside and they go to a timer a tie him or why would you have a timer for something you have delivered through the mail what\nYou expect somebody\nByrd through the mail what do you expect somebody to open it up and then like I guess I should set this for two minutes\n... is it doesn't make any sense\nBut then it seems like that's what happened with um with the George Soros one someone else picked it up from his mailbox opened it up saw that it was some device\nWalked it over to the woods and put it down then called the police and the police came and blew it up right but I mean that's like ... this was a a bomb that was supposed to be triggered by being opened\nDoesn't seem that to be that there's a timer on it you think it's a it's a time bomb but you don't set a time through the mail I noticed that means it's ridiculous\nVery strange ridiculous uh let me go to Kim in Virginia who's a US mail carrier a hello Kim\nHey Glenn I'm actually from outside of Charlottesville [laughter]\nOh what a hateful racist even those that are liberal city I've ever I've never been in yeah well I I just want to point out that the guys who organized that in Charlottesville we're from Florida so just how you\nCould not family I took my family both protests not because we wanted to be a part of one of my kids to share because I'm like you're not going to learn history unless they go to these places so wow well\nAnyway why tuna anyway yeah I'm a mail carrier then about three years [noise] um I'm not buying that it's being shipped to them and they're being sent to the mail at all um it's three fifty is in first class parcel\nUm I heard somebody on the news yesterday saying something about that like access it posted this on it well the forever stance you know it's good for whatever you know try to stand up to um to me that six chance they're not even three fifty um there is no cancellation mark so there's no way\nIt went through a processing plant and they cannot have Donald over the counter because of the courts where I picked up on that if I Know every now and I come across something like that I don't elaborate that it has not been process I take it back question at you know anything in a letter anything\nSo that that's the thing is that all these red flag like what what how how are they getting the rhetoric and it's not the postal service well that was the one that I saw the picture I shouldn't say all\n[noise] yeah well there was one today that was found in the uh postal office in Delaware I think literally you say that yeah so but I I I I Wonder the same thing I look for the cancellation of insulation\nThere's none of mine supposedly delivered by career which will be completely from the U.S protests are yeah\nYeah because we were pretty you know we're working at work were shown and you know tall you don't get anything like I say even a letter with no cancellation march we don't deliver it get sent back to get you know return to sender it we we don't pregnant elected their quirks did they what they're going to do with it so\nLet me ask you if you got a piece of a package in the mail and it said it came from Glenn Beck and it had assigned book it it would you open it or would you just immediately\nThrow it away at all what if you had assigned book from Glenn Beck or in well I Would I Would I Would open all wow All right well then I got out of the main one I'm going to make one for it to him I'm going to make this an an acme book\n[laughter]\nA lot of my appreciated your copy of the outrage is on the way\nThat's a that's why I've been at the names consistent with what I've heard from people\nWho do this for a living\nNone of this checks out doesn't make any sense [laughter]\nAll

P. Morgan it was the morgue and house if you will his office was in there\nOne of the bombs went off right next to that building\nBut Morgan had built this classical building so deep and so thick that it didn't penetrate anything thirty eight people killed a hundred and forty three severely injured the bomb went off just off of the sidewalk and it didn't affect his building\nExcept there are ... marks from the shrapnel in the building look it up twenty three Wall Street\nYou'll see the shrapnel on the side of that building the pocket marks and Morgan said we're not going to repair it\nLeave it there as a symbol that no one scares us no one is going to push us into a revolution no one is going to scare us leave it there don't try to hide or cover up those pockmarked\nNow I don't know how many people in the media today even know that story\n\nI can guarantee you nobody is telling you that story they're saying this is unprecedented and it has to be the rights historically speaking it's almost always the left\nNow this might be the right but it might be actually Republican because Republicans are known for not getting anything done uh\nAnd so this guy built these bombs and build them in such a way that they were never going to explode\nI don't know who built these bombs could be somebody from the left could be somebody from the right\nBut it's unusual that you could build this these this number of bombs and none of them\nWent off remember\nNineteen\nTwelve bombs were delivered twelve bombs went off Seventeen were not delivered Seventeen were stopped before they could go off\nThis time not a single bomb went off\nWe're dealing with somebody who has not just the lack of sophistication but is completely incompetent and may be crazy and I thank God for that no one was hurt or injured but there is the other possibility\nAgain you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves having to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing that when they get\nHere the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at just creates a whole lot of headaches for them in the process\nMike I gotta I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah in Honduras\nSaid been following the news or on the caravan here locally\nOr been also a fan of your show watch your show and I have to applaud you and your intel um the origins of this migrant march this all wrapped it in in two thousand nine when the president of Honduras Manuel ... men well a ... a\nA lackey of Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro was ousted constitutionally by the other two branches of government\nEver since then we Hondurans have lived in chaos many of the things are have been tried by ... and his party ... which translates to Freedom Party to destabilize our country this latest sons of his ... blames American\nLatest sons of his ... blames America and has made America is now reaping what its own type statements he says that America must take into migrants because America has supported the current administration\nThat he claims is caused all the misery that we Hondurans are living through\nSadly the migrants have been lied to and have been told that America must accept them in one news report a lady was interviewed a and she told the Honduran reporter that they were promised buses to travel on once they got to Guatemala but there were no buses waiting for them\nSome of the migrants have returned home one twenty two year old man died in Mexico for reasons unknown as of yet what's really sad and frustrating is many of these migrants have been a told that they will get in and they'll have jobs waiting for them when they arrived in America\nThere for many or good with hopes of a better life\nBut this is the type of situation that these criminals are who are the originator of this march will take advantage of\nSomebody's messing with them and we have to remember that most members of the caravan or ineligible for asylum or earlier this year or the department of justice clarified that you cannot claim asylum simply because your home country is unsafe\nBy definition by law aside least face in individual in particular I danger in their home countries\nAnd because there's no legal basis for the vast majority of those in a caravan to remain in the United states ah we end up doing what we can what we can to prevent people from making the journey at all that but this this statement you just read is part of it is\nA narrative is false rhetoric that is perpetuating the problem and I think it needs to be called out as such just\nBecause they have a country that is a mess of the government that has made life unpleasant for everyone there does not mean that any particular person necessarily has a valid claim for asylum in the United states\nMike have you heard have you heard anything talking to Senator Mike Lee have you heard anything about what Mike Pence revealed I think it was not yesterday day before I'm On a that Venezuela is behind the funding of of this\n[noise] um I had not heard that but uh we're hearing all the time different theories about who might be fun to get ... that is interesting it's an interesting theory that Venezuela might be doing it begins Venezuela is broke Venezuela's perhaps a as broke as any country in the region right now\nAnd so that would really be something if they were doing it\n[noise] what do we do if they make it to the border Mike I mean well the Univision I think it's Univision is reporting that that number has now fourteen thousand I think that's hard to

what that would do it or already overwhelmed immigration courts or immigration courts are nowhere near being ready to handle that kind of volume but nowhere near ready to be handling the kind of volume that they've already got\nA and so I I suspect that we will need to um\nOut a whole lot of additional human resources let's just say in order to make sure that our border isn't completely overrun and that it doesn't just become a free for all for people to enter the country unlawfully we have no idea no ability to control who comes in once there is um\n[noise] ah that kind of stampede

toll free at one\nAid for four to one nine twelve fifty Dr Don how are you today I'm doing well thank you how are you are less um arms is fine or so of all the way for some colors usually have some pretty darn good topics to talk about what you bring to us today so\nOctober is [noise] breast cancer awareness month and you know these awareness issues are great because they're they're helping make us aware of of of a diagnosis and\nAnd maybe screening and and a lot of times they're very helpful in in reducing the amount of debt from a certain disease\nIn this case we're talking about breast cancer and it gets very interesting to me because breast cancer is one that we we see a lot of hype about in the news which is good I Want people to learn about it there's a lot of different organizations out there with the pink ribbons and\nAnd you know they're reminding us about people that had breast cancer in in and to go get screened\nThe problem is that they're not really advocating the the the eradication of the disease if they were this would have been taken care of years ago you know they they really more interested in the business of medicine if you will or or basically\nDriving people to getting the ... you know the treatment center and the the the work opposite and that that really is supportive of\nMedical care right you know if you know helping to increase the profits\nIs one way to look at it and it will the reason I say that it's because of it over you know since the Nineteen thirties we really haven't seen a significant increase in in the improvement of the mortality of breast cancer really hasn't changed drastically even though we've we've\nSeen advances in treating and now we are seeing new treatments and we're not talking about those specifically because there's only brand new I fermented static disease and those are having some interesting promise\nBut when we look at the conventional therapies today you know we're really not seeing eradication of disease right and and we're not seeing any discussion of things that really had great impact on the outcome of the disease as far as lifestyle changes and there's a lot of evidence\nTo support lifestyle changes yet these companies that support awareness never talk about them ever in fact if you bring it up to them if you're a supporter or part of their organization they will ... you from talking about ways stop people from getting breast cancer who truly fascinates me and I I can\nI can tell a story a little later a ... a really good friend of the doctor Don show was doctor was hired to recoup seated on this show with me who had breast cancer and ... and ... and actually chores her cancer\nHas been exposed to throughout their life the increased risk they have for breast cancer and of course women\nTheir bodies make estrogen kind of important a sexual hormone um but if you have early onset of of your menstrual cycle you know historically women\nStarted and it's called ... the start of men seizes men are and ... men awkward channel around twelve to fourteen even his latest sixteen year olds today we're seeing and especially in western cultures Israelis eight nine years old\nRight and then the other end of the spectrum we're talking about and applause where women are now stopping their menstrual period used to be is you know maybe the mid ... thirties to the mid forties now we're seeing it even later into the mid forties in the mid fifties even in some cases\nSo much longer period of exposure to their own estrogen right increases their risk of of a developing breast cancer but also exposure to other estrogen is very important and of course we're talking about birth control pills which a lot of women take\nEarly on in their life to not get pregnant or later in their life they may be put on hormone replacement which is\nMore recently fallen by the wayside for specifically reasons that it can cause cancer as we've known 'em but that was one thing that we put people on and we found that it's not really good idea anymore but still there are women put on it for severe symptoms posts\nA good idea anymore but still there are women put on it for severe symptoms post menopausal we um if\nYou're eating a lot of animal based foods a lot of dairy has a lot of estrogen in it because it's a product of lactation ah so you have to be aware of that and as well things in your environment like pesticides that are absorb things are in your food or you get it you know by working in your garden or\nA plastics in the environment they get in to your food source and then into your body are ah estrogen causes estrogen like the fact so again has the same negative effect an increased risk toward\nDeveloping a breast cancer so so the longer you're exposed to estrogen that puts you at risk if you're obese\nThese estrogen the estrogen deposits in in the the fat cells so you're exposed to the estrogen that you've made for longer periods of time and when you lose weight it's released into your system over ... years of time ah so again more risk or because you're you're being exposed for longer periods of time to the same estrogen\nUm [noise]\nSo there's a whole multitude of reasons why we developed cancer and a lot of it because of us you know me like if you drink to excess alcohol and put your written in fact if you only drink one drink a day that put you in about a\nFour to ten percent increased risk if you drink three drinks a day that put you at a forty to fifty percent increased risk so significant increase risk if you drink um if you take estrogen as I said pills um if you have a longer period of of your menstrual period\nUm you were at greater risk as I said um if you're not eating enough fruits and vegetables that the the fiber in the fruits and vegetables increases er or re absorbs a lot of the the the estrogen and decreases the amount that sort of keep circulating through your body\nSo the more animal based food you eat the more extreme you get from the animals are put you at greater risk if you're sedentary and you're not exercising you put your greater risk you're right in the fifty here at great risk because most cancers are picked up around that point trying that forty to fifty we start to screen because of the risk and of course if you have\nA primary relative your mom your sister your grandmother maybe\nHad breast cancer you are at greater risk\nUm the ... genes I talked about it a little bit if you're a night shift worker you're actually at increased risk because of disruption of your circadian\nRhythms as well as depressed melatonin levels which increases your estrogen levels so it increases the risk as well and if you live in western part of the world but you live in the northern climes\nOr the higher latitudes you're at greater risk because of that [noise]\nSo there's a lot of factors that you can control and there's a lot of factors that you cannot control\nRight so I I always say well let's control the factors that we can control and worry less about the ones that we cannot um and so losing weight is important right exercising is absolutely key or if you're in the wrong geographic location maybe that's not something to likely move\nYou know it'd be nice to maybe moved to sunny climates southern part of the country but that may not be possible again changing all the other parameters that are within your around that would be the best idea and would that\nNot also potentially just increase the risk of skin cancer [noise] perhaps that's a whole nother and no not necessarily because actually sun exposure does increase it but you actually if you don't get enough sun exposure\nAnd women who are at higher latitudes actually a greater risk for melanoma ... so less sun exposure actually put your greater risk for melanoma but I'm ... and usually unless son expose parts of the body and melanoma is interesting the the the skin cancers that are more likely common\nWhen you get some exposure a bays and in ... and those less likely to kill you ... removed thousands maybe tens of thousands of those in my career so far\nAnd nobody will die from okay but the ... melanoma definitely\nUm other things you can do is oh if the early in the early or your first pregnancy is the more protective that is the higher amount of children that you have put you at greater risk a decreased risk I'm Sorry so more children less risk of breast cancer\nAnd the longer you breastfeed your children put you at decrease risk ... which is good\nSo if you're a nun who never had children and that's not a joke you actually are at greatest risk for developing breast cancer especially if you live in a monastery at a high altitude I Will not so much high altitude but a greater higher latitudes are in the country\nUm if you're higher altitude there's other issues I thought you said out loud a sun shines less right higher latitudes\nRight um so where are we in the day okay just\nBlowing through this stuff ... we're going to be done in five seconds now so let's talk about soap\n\nIt's real quick here if you have a question for Dr Don regarding a breast cancer or any kind of cancer he's very knowledgeable man or\nAnything that's not feeling quite right with you please do feel free to call in if you're inking golden valley nine to eight seven five three twelve thirty in Bullhead city ... valley and needles if nicer wait seven six three fourteen Ninety and of course the toll free at one aid for four to one nine twelve fifty all those numbers are on the\nWebsite that talk ages the dot com along with the stream for the station\nSo the American the American Cancer Society recommends that you get a yearly mammogram for screening right at at at the age of forty and above and and that's been the recommendation for years and they've been telling us that it saves lives\nBecause we're catching stuff early and that may be true and there are cases without a doubt that we catch it early cancer we eradicated and the person goes on to live a normal life and that's absolutely true the problem is that when you make recommendations as as in this case for every single person\nRight we we ... you know it's not always true and what we've learned over time is that there for every one person we saved me how many do we have to screen before we saved one\nAnd that has now it's starting to come clear because there's a lot of really interesting studies out there and there's a couple of groups out there that have started to look at all the different studies together to put it together and really make sense of it\nYou know because you know in in medicine is really interesting that you know we can we can do a study\nYou know and and we can you set it up the way we want and get some results but that doesn't necessarily apply to the real world right and what we do it in animals it doesn't necessarily apply to the real world even if we do it in humans it doesn't always apply to the real world because we've controlled for a lot of factors\nRight but when we look at your evidence based issue when we look at overall ... studies of the population in general\nYou know things that where we're not doing the studies to control for anything but we're just seeing what the outcomes of what we're doing we begin to see a different picture you know we start to understand that you know for a lot of women that get mammograms there's a lot of women that get treated unnecessarily\nYou because we're picking stuff up when we're finding well yeah we're finding changes in the mammogram\nBut you know more and we're very proactive you know when it comes to cancer it's a very scary diagnosis so you you get in you know a twenty year old woman who comes in with a lump in Nebraska than you do a mammogram and there's some changes on the mammogram\nYou can't not go further and study it take out the ... you know do\nWhatever other tests for them I mean you know and you do lumpectomy and and then you do the the pathology and and you know looking to see if it spreads the knows I mean the of course you're going to do that every person that has a lump because we don't know until we studied that lump whether it's going to go on to cancer and I\nHad a civil biopsy won't cover it has to be a a lumpectomy\nWill know a biopsy what may tell us that it is a cancer it may tell us um you know what tissue type it is will tell us the stage 'cause we have to go further to find out where else in the body it is\nUm but it's not it doesn't tell us the outcome in fact\nThat's the point to the stories that a lot of times we'll we'll there's some early changes in cells that look cancer like\nAnd of course immediately we have to think the worst than we do and we move forward with taking care of take the lump outdoor things and then we find out well actually this was not a cancer that was going to become met a static or this was not the type of cancer that maybe would have killed the person\nA war we found something in screening mammogram that we do the diagnostic mammal right what's the difference between the amount of radiation it's the technique they use is how long they they radiate the breast I mean there's there's a whole protocol it's different\nThat doesn't change the outcome but but that together with other studies\nHelps us to make the decisions again this is not an easy diagnosed to make\nRight but if we're just going on screening mammograms and we're saying that's what you need to do I'm trying to show that that's not the only thing you need to do and that you know we used to teach women young women to to breast self exams and we found that we thought that was a great idea\nBut then we found that a lot of those women were getting treated unnecessarily\nAnd so the Cochrane review group looked at that and they they found that and they looked at two large populations and they randomly assigned to doing self exams and the other half were not\nAnd what they found in the study was that there was no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality whether a woman did for self exam or not\nThat they weren't able to pick up cancers any faster\nBy doing self exam they might have found things they might have been alerted to concerns they might have been freaked out about it and of course and they weren't for the man when they got the lumpectomy and then they found out later on after all of the sudden necessary treatment that it wasn't cancer again ... creating a more hysteria\nAnd you know and it gets people and I understand why people get hysterical it's cancer yeah right I Do understand that and I'm not blaming the patients they've been told to do this so it's really not their fault they don't blame them and they're not medically educated right they\nOur issue that we have to work out um what they found was twice as many biopsies with benign results were found in women who did self exams versus those who did not that kind of makes sense you know people who are not doing exam Sophia lumped so\nIt makes sense and of course and I would I Would agree with that I've I have had women come into my office I've had them with lumps are changes in the breast than we've gone to do the studies and we found things we move them along and we've gotten the biopsies and the lumpectomy and all the treatments and many of them were not cancer\nSomewhere but those are the fewer cases what we're trying to figure out how do we not take those long steps that are not necessary to take that and I think that's a hard question\nIs it just going to be a change and the types of screenings that are used for less or I think I think it's I think it's going to be whole multitude of things but we'll try to get to that okay in the show\n[noise] [noise] so as a result they could not reach they had not recommend breath breast self exams or even a physician's physical exam they're saying they're not much more reliable so\nWe're not doing that anymore we're not educating women to do their their breast self exams uh we're now suggesting that screening memos are dangerous um you know because they might put you at risk for unnecessary treatment\nI'm so really the the issue is that women really need to learn early on uh about their breasts and they need you know or they need to examine but from the standpoint of understanding normal versus abnormal and then any changes that's the woman's responsibility you have any changes to your doctor\nSo that's that's it there there's nothing else for women I mean I don't blame women because we've created these problems and we told them you know if you feel this lump it's cancer come to the doctor and that's fine\nBut what what we're suggesting is if we have somebody constantly checking they're going to be anxious right because any little change you know every you know two weeks or three weeks is going to alert them what they're saying is slow down watch for changes and and go see your doctor\nThe question then is with the doctor do in the case of the mammogram the diagnostic mammogram needs to be done the ultrasound should be done in addition to that there's a halo screen that they do which aspiration fluid from the nipple which can test for uh for for cancer cells right\nUm and then you know if you need and there's a big question\nYou can do an MRI memorize a lot more sensitive as well\nI still question and bring the breast surgeon as you know as part of the team\nOf course the breast surgeon first thing they do they want to take it out and I understand that that's what they're trying to do but we don't want to go to the breast surgeon that quickly if we can rule out issues you know I mean once you've disfigured the woman's breast once you've just figured the human body it's not coming back you know you're not going to it's not going to look better later on and\nYou know you want to avoid that if you can at all costs\n... the costs what they found is the cost of of breast cancer screening is about a billion dollars\nAnd and the way they come to that number is Medicare shelled out over the last year about two point four two billion dollars in the screening and treatment of breast cancer in Medicare population a billion of that half of it was screening alone\nSo the reason why this is so important is it screening is of low value why are we wasting so much money needs to change your efforts and really focus on and do more studies like the Cochrane groups in the in in the group to really focus in on what the best approaches for every patient\nShould we just take the million dollars and put it into MRI infrastructure\nThe you know uh yes it will be the answer is it depends on what you manufacture it isn't it I mean then that my company would say yes [laughter] right yeah you know the mammogram companies is working on the new mammal which they're working on new protocol\nI mean I don't know what the final answer is I'm going to be an honest with you and I think that we have to take into account all of them oh Dallas that we have and and take each patient individually\nYou know and and and you know if they're if they're Twenty years old I think you push them differently than if they're Seventy years old\nNot that you're not concerned about the twenty year old but you're not you know you're not doing the same thing in the seven year old uh you know that may be something completely different in the twenty year old maybe something aggressive but I think you need study both of them as an individual\nAnd they think that's something that we have to develop protocols for ... and we talked about a a you know I'm concussions and in the NFL and the NFL has to take every single player individually there's not one way to approach all concussions and I think the same wave for breast cancer and I think it's it's it's virtually all cancers\nRight is individual treatment the problem is that it's very hard to make protocols for every single person that applies to everybody\nAnd I think that's that's been a I think that's an issue that's very uncomfortable for most physicians because\nWe like political you know like a big book with a very concrete answers\nWe like political you like a big book with the very concrete answers in it that keep you from having to get into into the weeds on something\nWell there's that and I think we like you know when a patient comes to us and they have a series of symptoms we'd like to say okay this is where we started and we have a protocol to follow yeah I think that's um the easiest way to to practice right but it's not the best way for the patient right and you have to kind of individualized everything we do\nAll right ah we're going to take another break here on live and local in the afternoon on page ... when we come back we're going to finish up with Dr Don talking about breast cancer
