comments about President Trump that when he says he's a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John your comments\nOr a I think that folks get so wrapped around the actual around the around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving as a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great artists that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home\nYou know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that that look the same on us\nOr or uniforms

Debbie Stabenow your opponent\nIn this Michigan Senate race clearly has no ideas she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is the basic this is absolutely base you know we we learned the amount of ... of angers class we'd be logical fallacies ad hominem attacks\nOr you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these policies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a for her part has been a career politician for forty years has collected four million dollars and the taxpayers only got five hooker co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... those fiber remain buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzzword when she's anything but\nShe's a salad a as a New York senator loaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five and nine to ... some of the time a spectacle and the promises she's made around\nAround Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around and taking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and in our veterans were coming back home she's broken promises to what I say to her all the time and I would I tell people in the state of Michigan and a half\nIs why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected they engage in this politics to drive us apart and what I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this a lot of Debbie Stabenow now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of\nOf majority rule and Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\nA better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year career in politics to continue suddenly she Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\n[noise] uh she she is a selective uh in her position she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and Chuck Schumer will tell her I'm centers to have it on and you can\nSee our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around a but senators half an hour will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she's the court sanctuary cities and she will not do anything to secure order she's going up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is something we need to get done right now are we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who's going to work with anyone ever wanted to get this thing done because this is a matter of a economic and national security and it cannot be

and read the things that we have written you're not surprised and you are way ahead of\nThe game of what's going on with this caravan let's give you some additional information because it's it's\nIt's very important what Mike Pence said yesterday Mike Pence came out in the oval office and said this is being funded by Venezuela now the mainstream press they're not going to do anything but ridicule that but\nThis makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense of it does sound crazy when you first hear about it like if you're not if you don't know the back story here like Venezuela you know like oh here we go again and they can't afford anything yeah there is blaming something in the country so we can get involved or whatever you know or yeah or the how do they even have the money to do this\nBut um it makes perfect sense when you hear when you put it into the context of the relationship to Honduras had with a book Venezuela in Cuba it makes absolutely perfect sent in particular\nThese this group that SARS started this caravan they are the group that is that backed the ousted Marxist a radical a president that was ousted in Honduras\nRight and there they still have a populist avenue to go to like their goals are stated goal is still to restore that President back to the power and he was and they do have kind of a case there and an international case because he was democratically elected\nSo really if they can make such a firestorm such a big media uprising over this get international support and backing make could technically eventually may try and get this guy back in the power but that is their goal that and that's where this started I think that's where Honduras that this party these people in Honduras while they originally organized this\nBut Venezuela also has other reasoning a reason to be behind this now have you I mean you think about it just was a few months ago um Venezuelan president ... uh with just survived to a an assassination attempt\nAnd he blamed the United states people in the United states for um a were backing those people he blames nine states for the economic or her basically ... all the things that are wrong with them if not socialism if the United states is fault that at that socialism by working not the theory behind him\nI'm so he blames us for all these things so if you are my door oh you want to strike back they just tried to kill you and his words how do you do it when you can't compete with the United states in a conventional matter you have to go non conventional way\nAnd you have to understand too that\nIt was the ousting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things a new government did was get out of the ... agreement which was agreements of hey we're going to prop each other\nThem economically big time so he's got a double reason for doing this ... this is huge and this is huge so you really need to look at it through that lens they have a gigantic political and future economic reasoning behind all this is a very big plan it you know in place to do all this\nI mentioned before that um Iran and both Syria were big time observers of this economic union\nAnd a lot of people have been focusing on what would have ISIS gets into this uh you know to this group or whatever you mentioned the possibility of Cuban intelligence Venezuela intelligence was I think it's probably Ninety percent likely that they are a part of this caravan\nUm but also a through I uh Iran Hezbollah\nHezbollah could be all in this uh care of it I have no information on that note no intelligence behind it but because of all the actors because of everyone involved the because of the people that are are are still ... Venezuela Iran\nRight now that you could be has below would be my ... if I'm at a U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for Hezbollah links you know inside of the Caribbean\nAnd I guarantee you the U.S intelligence agencies are all over this I'm sure we've infiltrated this\nThat's why when when the vice president United States\nSays that oh the Honduran president told me this\nHe's not reporting on here say like that would be here say unless they seriously have something behind it I fully thinks he knows I think I heard your interview with a gun or having to yesterday yeah he knew he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela's behind that when the governor of Texas is not going to say that but I Do think vice president Pence tipped his hand on that\nI really think that they're behind us another question now is how does this escalate\nYou mentioned waves of attacks we already know there's a there's a caravan forming in El Salvador there's a carrier and forming in Guatemala and who are they form of who's forming them that we don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border all with Honduras\nSo the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework liberty and re foundation party in Honduras I Would not be surprised if we if we hear more names in\nEl Salvador in Guatemala forming these uh ... because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people Honduras anymore so they probably go there are those are their allies in El Salvador Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border countries\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats in the election but this is an absolute nightmare\nThe build up to it what happens on the border may actually work to their advantage politically because you'll have the big fat American Soldiers standing up\nHow are they\nHow who's taking care of the medical care young who's who is who is taking care of the food for seven thousand people\nThe diapers alone with the infant\nThis sanitary conditions must be strong how are they sleeping how are they moving with somebody 'cause I Want to help I Want to help I just I didn't know if ... Smith\nShow where they were sleeping they're sleeping on the pavement and it's burning hot pavement the ... going on yeah and um\nWhere where are they getting the water because you can't take Seventy five hundred people into a small town\nYou know and and and go into the seven eleven and say hey we need that you know fourteen thousand bottles of water [laughter] you can't know no one for right now 'cause I'm a little Thursday we haven't we haven't had a drink and two hundred miles and take one for the road\nOne for the road for everybody and one\nDrink now yeah I just need fourteen thousand bottles of water I'm sure the studies\nThat they're stopping get probably has fourteen thousand bottles of water okay yeah so I'm sure it's they just stop it stuck he's yeah OK along the way ... um\nYou keep saying something about a political stunt you keep talking you know the the funding funding ... funding has life change whether I hear oh okay oh all these questions about\nWhere they got they got them from a who organized or caused the care of in ...\n... or ... initially organized and in October for Facebook post he shared a graphic promoting a migrant march\nThe graphic told

generally speaking they riot generally speaking that's what you do does it's a riot starter yeah yes it is\nYes it is so I'm fights I'm Glad you're finally admitted I why with Mike Pence say that Venezuela is behind you probably haven't read the political article yeah well he's also a liar we know that for ... yes\nAnd the hate monger mongering and hatred and lives he's lying hate monger who mongers in\nMany different places such as hate in life so go so bad yeah ... these guys make it to our border I think they do\nYeah ... is Mexico gonna stop 'em well a way Greg Abbott said yesterday they would really yeah yeah he was on with you I Will be stunned he thinks Mexico will stop it'll stop them when is that going to happen I don't\nBecause I don't know I don't have my crystal ball or my connection to the Mexican president were lower fickle ... article to tell you what's happening you know the dog or have that right but yet the\nLocals in Mexico are saying it's the caravans grown to fourteen thousand people now and they continue to head north but I'm\nHopeful bill there's two others the news that we've broken this morning there are two other caravans that are now forming behind this one\nWell because they've seen you know the seriousness of the countries along the way that they're just well no they're not going to be stopped so yet they continue to come and can you imagine if we allow\nThese people all all fourteen thousand or however\nMany are there and then the caravan after and the one after that what does that say to future\n... no you're over there is there a foreign land is over it's over California will be offers to collapse [noise] uh yeah even if they\nAre or what the Democrats are saying they are that they're just all downtrodden people who just want to come to America and find jobs well okay but are we going to get fourteen thousand at a time month after month after month after month that's not going to work out well for us I\nI guess they think we can just accept an infinite number well into our country the good news is they're all good people yeah they are right except for the fact that all of them no\nNo I actually well we're not according to the people in the care of him\nNot to hold a gentle way who will do what do they know\nRaul it's a good point not hoarding ... in the caravan and yeah they they talk to him I heard in a caravan and are found asked them\nAbout about the criminal element mhm listen\nTo him in those everywhere [noise]\nHis criminal say here I mean it is oh my God this is not that many I mean this is a

what this\nMeans are about to since about ... not ... is no we don't leave because we want to violence and poverty ... us allies out\nHuh uh-huh they tell you\nIt's not about that\nThis is now the there maybe some people in that group and there maybe some criminals there may be something that actually believe that that's not what this is about this was started as a reaction to gather this same group\nWhat about the Facebook place for folks as right here in fact\nI was getting kicked [laughter]\nTo a restaurant and you know ... you know all I hear in my head is all of the response Glenn Beck conspiracy theorists very hard times I mean there's all over the place well yeah oh yeah let's check the Democratic\nParty what do you think you know there are now saying yeah capitalism doesn't

I don't I really honestly do not understand stew brought this up read the the times article that you brought up\nThe times article is anatomy does not determine gender experts say that's the title and now it's kind of seems through discussion of this Trump planned to change the way people register on paperwork as you'd be registering as a as the sects you were born out not to sex you believe you are today\nSo that's kind of where it seemed it of course every piece of news must go through some sort of Trump's filter to see whether you can blame Trump or excuse Trump or ... no one can just talk about an issue anymore\nBut through at the ... yeah about halfway through the story you get this and I was fascinated by this discussion 'em how to define identity researchers say gender identity comes from the brain not the body some put it more bluntly that originates between your ears not between your legs\nAnd so yes I Would say like that strikes me as I read it again almost like a conservative critique right of\nOh that's come in between you is not your leg right exactly right and this is supposed\nTo be what the researchers are saying and it struck me as I was reading that that\nWe're discussing two different things like the reason why you would want someone to register as a male or female let's say on a government health care for right would be something because not because of the feeling in their brain right like what they really are at like you would have to cover for example or you know birth\nRight of something that a man can't do well right now and again that the other player has University of of Obamacare and other things but the the point being\nYou know you're there's a reason to know these things in theory\nWith the government not because they're tracking how the feeling they're not tracking um how you feel in your brain right they're talking about specific thing that that\nBody parts can do and you know that it you know there might be a higher risk of breast cancer or higher risk of another type of cancer that doesn't change because your mind\nFeels like you're more like a boy than you are a girl gender has they have gotten away\nFrom one traditional definition of gender which is male or female I'm among the other part of the definition of gender is describing traits\nThat is really kind of you know a feminine that is a traditional a masculine gender okay those traits the tomboy the Tom boy that's a masculine gender trait okay right but those are traits\nThe ... for instance is we we say that it's bad to be anorexic because you are seeing your body and the way that is not reality and it's dangerous it doesn't\nIt's not a healthy the outlook um\nSee the staff of people who have just\nUm we see the stats of people who have gender ... more ... and the suicide rates are really bad\nHaving the sex change and everything else is not changing those suicide rates so why are we taking the the gender ... and say hey it's totally fine when it's not it's not the suicide rates are bad\nUh I Would agree that when we got taught that it's called ... I think many people who are coming out is transgender nowadays\nProbably have some other psychiatric condition that isn't being diagnosed because clinicians aren't able to do their job properly\nSo if someone comes into your clinic and says that they are transgender I don't work with patients anymore but um if someone comes in Allen says that they're transgender clinician really does have to take that at face value they're not really allowed to\nTo ask a question because that scene that's trans Celtic so I think nowadays because it seemed that trade trendy to trends that can be hard it ends up someone who had\nAnother form of psychopathology it's manifesting as something that has to do the gender even ... I think that to us at 'em but with regards to lie transitioning shouldn't be seen as something beneficial in research that show\nFor some people that can help I Do think if\nOthers things happened ruled out that it it can be beneficial for somebody um I think ultimately adults should be free to do it they won't let their body\nSo so do I don't get me wrong so do I but I I I think what a I was getting to and you just answered is\nWith his friends phobia the vis vis uh just hurting everybody into asked no questions\nIs dangerous it's just dangerous for people and and we we should look in the end you're an adult you get to do what you want to do and I'm fine with that but just the silencing of thought and in this case\nScience and medicine is is terrifying\nYeah but I mean going back to the difference between gender disoriented if something like anorexia with people who are gender just for their brain has been partially either my schooling I extending I\nWrite and correction I got out of that potentially they can if I write the thing is the studies that showed that ...\nAre also conflated with sexual orientation so if you had a study on trans women say so these are people who are pointing out that identifies female they are also attracted for the most part two men\nSo when you see these brain study it's we're still not clear on it like for instance we're seeing are due to then identifying female\nOr do to them being sexually attracted to that because they are very strong neural correlate are associated with sexual orientation that that's the other thing that people aren't talking about is that is has a lot to do with sexual orientation being gay\nAnd so the brain call it that people are talking so much about how transgender transgender is in the brain it's not really accurate because when we don't know for sure yet\nDr ... thank you so much appreciate it\nOnly enlightening to talk to somebody who was knocked politically correct and it doesn't agree with

life in a horrible experience and he felt this way and I and I went along so I don't want to hurt him I don't know I if that's what made him happy I when I say that but a record of law no and your

famous for that but that is a very long military career he was a he was a very much a a you know a Washington insider really knew the behind the scenes politics of it and you hear him talking about

kind of a fun look at the news here's here's what Sean Spicer said yesterday just a little bit of what he said about the this election\nThe problem is that their face the vocal minority of their base keeps dragging them so far in the left\nThat they kind of have to keep fumbling passed each other to outdo each other to prove who is the most ... and that's the biggest problem that we have right now for the Democrats that the ... they have been the biggest helpers to the Republican Party over ... because like going so far to the left in trying to ... this this law which is what it really is\nThey've lost the ability to talk about things on and I know [laughter] um [noise] they they for most pragmatic traditional Democrat they feel like the party so far left them\nI actually think he might heavy turnout problem you're talking about it with the Latino community now\nI think the Democrats is ironic is this may sound may actually losing the enthusiasm gap by big margin heading into the ... midterms because a lot of these folks are saying well they they've now expose do they really are this isn't about fighting for workers' rights are environmental causes that we've cared about for so long\nAnd this isn't about impeachment investigation I don't know that I bought in on that if you're a traditional Democrat and I think that they look at the Republican who haven't focused on a pretty pragmatic agenda of economic growth low unemployment deregulate tearing down the deregulatory state\nAnd I you know I'm not sure I'm\nA Republican but I kind of agree with that agenda so when the dust settles how many Republican senators are\nFifty five fifty five and I think if if you call me into a highly wrong is fifty six [laughter] it'll be okay with that but I I think that the way

on the lake fire and held today [noise] because hell has frozen over a ... a member of the media\nHas now actually admitted that he shouldn't have dismissed Juanita broad Rick's accusation against Bill Clinton now this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post where his name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post ... sixty eight\n[noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought Juanita Broderick wasn't credible\nI was wrong\nNow Juanita Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight but since the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings\nNow one of the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed to other media yet somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n...\nThat's really why is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit\nThat they may have been wrong about Broderick it's Twenty years later\nNow this has been obviously influenced by the me too movement but Cohen now admits to dismissing Broderick claims during the Clinton presidency is just another wild accusation made by twisted Clinton haters NBC's Lisa Myers recently told\nThe only told slate I tested Broderick story every way I could again and again and again I'm quoting and no detail ever change it never got better it never got worse it was always the same and\nQuote Cohen now wonders why Monica Lewinsky is now totally characterized as a victim while Broderick is ignored\nIsn't that interesting\nMonica Lewinsky who has always say she says she wasn't a victim is now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped she's ignored Cohen says\nIt might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter\nCome on I couldn't have anything to do with it Cohen writes\nI remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nMe ask you a question\nUnlike Broderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike he's Allison who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose the evidence is overwhelming\nThose two things you can look at and you can say there's evidence there you'd shoot you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh there was no evidence but if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence and it was presented\nI Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it\nWhy\nIs it that no one on the left is willing to do that\nWhether\nDealing with Clinton or the capital cases all political camps should tread carefully in their certainty about the truth\nCertainty always seems to get us into trouble\nRequires a huge dose of something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today\nAnd that is humility Cohen seems to be exercising humility and for that I think the Washington Post columnist\nThank you for being willing to step out of the crowd go against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen is a pretty big moment\nRecently over the details that Broderick accusation like to have her on\nYeah she she would come on I think um she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had a similar reaction to it at the time or in which a lot of the accusations about affairs and stuff seem to credible but you know rapists I mean the the\nThe accusation was really brutal or by the time she had five corroborating witnesses that she told at the time uh she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window ... um which was confirmed that prison was there she was confirmed to be at this nursing Congress that was there he was in town like I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel it was at\nA and she knew the time period unless you know the exact date but everything else you had pretty much locked down pretty ... I Will tell you I\nAlways found her credible I found her more credible than anybody else you know Paula Jones you know I don't know [noise]\nAnd and the ... and the real shocking that Glenn is not only that the case with technology and the prevalence but among young people where it's most prevalent Eighteen to twenty four year old men\nThe numbers show that\nThey view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean you're a guy\nYou're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a rape is completely undefined but I mean you know I asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now I hear\nRape is you know I'm a ... I mean it's it's crazy and confusing\nAnd I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy\nWell anyway\nCause and who would argue with consequences for it right like it's just yeah I I Am I getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean this round out once for any it's not\nFor it right yeah not at all um I mean the the pets are that are in the court some you may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson\nThe ... that are in the score some\nYou may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens he went around and he was the he was the apology apologies that went around him and and so and so he laid that all out about how you know destructive this really is to relationships and how is the silent killer\nBecause there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church into your testimony and there's some sort of\nYou know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people you know roll out the record but there's you know if you've come up and you're the porn guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that one at your church I have never seen it right and so and so\nAnd actually the numbers in the study showed that even church leaders are are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out too\nIf I Know in you know in in in my church\nAnd you know my church is a good way to to you know [laughter] you know right now do we drink milk [laughter] and it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography and starts out as pornography and it just spirals out of control\nPlay too if you're if you're ... you know if you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up in front of your rights because the stigma is big I think it's interesting about what you've done here is like ... that the same way that\nThe negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it online and your own right like this course that you have a kind of saying it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily you can kind of go through and and hear these things without having to stand up for it in front of your chair I don't tell your neighbors of ... I mean I Know you're ready\nYeah I Know it's really a no it's I understand the stigma\nBut it's the same kind of stigma as he would have as a as an alcoholic twenty five years ago you have to um there's ... it is\nThis is natural as you said God gave us the sex drive and it is different between men and women and men are driven by their eyes it didn't we just are we're very visual women or not this visual as we are when it comes to sex and so there's\nIt's it's normal EDS normal yeah you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal is trying to say okay\nSome of that is good some of the too much of this is bad right\nRight and and what we're doing and it's like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid without because cultures gone so off the rails and it's that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you let inside\nYou know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean as you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but where do you watch it on Instagram which feeds are you looking at I mean it's in ... I'm not like\nThe women in bikinis showing their ... said right now I mean like only when I got in the rain when you're just rolling that all the way through I mean anything you know not be considered part I think I think some people can make that case and make a strong case\nThis is an argument that it ... you know my wife and I have all the time a because there's almost nothing you could watch on Netflix or Amazon yeah that unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't\nHave this you know so you know click click click to go ahead and and um you know\nFast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like don't stop watching we have stopped watching is honey let's just zip ahead of this part of\nYou know but [noise] is that right right is that right you know and it's not because he\nIs of course like how does it have recommendations for\nFilters is it about that type of thing with me we we mentioned those things because they're good like having Internet filters and in our town ability partners you know things are good but what we do is we really just try to get to the heart of it because those things are bandied they're they're right the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and eat and so it's\nYour your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to do this and that to get around it can be so we try to rewire your heart and show you what God it would give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it right do it right\nTo give me some of the stats\nUm while I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn monthly they admit that\nI I went to him too that if that's the admitted to number it's titled Lee I probably I actually just\nTo hold on higher I think it was something like I don't have one in six church leaders have admitted to struggling with this that's church one there's sex and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and and I and I believe because it's it's just you know meet\nSort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here I think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical\nYou know coming out and saying let's fight this thing because they know they're struggling with with themselves but I'll give you one more\nUm ah kids are being exposed\nSo but I'll give you one more um\nAh kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they missed under series misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about Mm I'm so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed at pornography as young as ten and eleven years old\nAnd they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into port at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you um and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight twenty nine years old you've been poisoning your brain now in how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life who thirds of your life\nAnd an hour and ... people to to be a good husband\nAnd it takes more and more to excite you\nYeah I mean it just it is a gateway fits the gateway it is you start with porn and and we we look at it fairs and that's the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started\nIn the house in your phone you know and like and we can talk about this but I guarantee our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't lie the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not getting your neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sitting in their car\nListening to this and and it's hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that would that shame and guilt and so that's why we made this course\nSet free course dot com because\nYou know God wants you to be free from this he he wants you to live in you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so that's what we want to\nThank you very much Dan thank you thank you for having\nMe I guess he's doing something with his life [laughter] after this\nSet free course dot com is a place to go get it and the Israel thing is coming up to where we have the ... documentary I was talking to Dan a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences\nOf seeing the media as they cover the Palestinians versus the way they covered the lessons and old to go over there now however the media and yet that's what this documentary became because the media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle\nYou actually ... you actually observe something above the gaggle down that they're just never aware of\nWall and and even more shocking line is when the gavel there they get the story wrong I mean it was unbelievable to me you know because we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't do and and open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so\nUm that's what we were therefore but then what we saw was how the media can talk to the narrative that's completely false\nUm that I'll I'll tell you a quick story of you know for some some context I downloaded a nap while I was there called red alert\nAnd so you can try this at home and test it and see if I'm if I'm I'm full of it\nBut it's called red alert and what it does is it you know you know those annoying alerts you get on your phone when they land flooded it's only allowed well it does that whenever a missile or rocket launched into Israel 'cause we wanted to follow okay there's a rocket falling down right where we're going to go find where they are and so I downloaded the dad and so it went off a few times over there\nUh I get home and you know\nAll of a sudden it like two in the morning like my my phone's just going bananas and like all day for like three days in a row like on and off I'm getting is I had to delete the app because it was so annoying that I was that these rockets were getting shot and Israel all the time\nAnd you know and then they want is they want you to your show ... that the picture like there's the contact like their rockets are flying in from Gaza all the time than the media shows up and it's like look at these Israeli you know evil soldiers just gunning down innocent hapless and the protesters there on the on the gods aboard ... why do you think the Israelis are taking it very seriously when\nThey're burning tires when they're burning tires and they're\nTrying to break through the fence

they are back on and so there isn't around a while a I have a lot of questions for you Randy uh since you've told us a little bit about your story tell us the smart and final smart and final extra story how what's the history of that company I don't know\nWell smart and final extra is just a division of our of smart and final it's we it's just a ... we've involved to now it's just became a more retail friendly or the stores in the past four more business oriented and this is just\nBasically it's a supermarket that also we saw a lot of business items for restaurants and local business in a organizations\nI yeah I Do a notice occasionally when I go in there you have larger bulk sizes and uh some restaurant prep items here and there if someone wants to fancy up their kitchen\nOh crack retail restaurant equipment and I'm just a lot of things you wouldn't buy in a normal typical supermarkets so I wasn't totally off when I thought that you were an off the supply store did you know it it kind of we are\nWell okay I have ever feeling dangerous they could like at the staples and then they have the section where they have the chips in the uh weird brown and African\nYou know that's why it's so it just shows you how little I knew about smart and final now tell us the dinner scene smart and final and smart and final extra\nThose my final extra we just have basically the same thing but just to expand\nExtra we just have basically the same thing but just expanded on all the sets are much more supplied much more variety we have gluten free products are healthier choices\nRoasted chicken or think incredibly large or a or produce departments it's off the charts and we have a really large meat select\nNot elections or not they've gone and ruined it for me I was gonna ask you about the history of smart and final before the show you told us that it was a last names of two gentlemen the founders practiced are smart and Mr final that is I was going to lead into it uh so tell tell us about smart and final Electra when did Mr extra German God [laughter] I don't know that's a great point\nI was probably about a about twelve years ago I had to fourteen years ago I Believe when they started tweaking the formats and I'm like the latest product let's go back to a little\nBit of in the history when did Mr smart and Mr final decided to open a store window that first story all\nIt was and it was in the Eighteen hundreds it was actually in Los Angeles it's over yeah it's it's crazy it's over a hundred and forty something years old now smart and final is a store\nChain that's been open over a hundred over a hundred years correct I did not know that I'm learning more and more by the second\nIt's been around for so long and it's sometimes hard to tell a like again I I'm not originally from here so I get here I see a Ninety nine cent I said oh that's novel I'm not sure if that's a like you know you don't want to discount store to get their party supplies maybe some of them are in the packaging\nAnd smart and final ... it's nice and not just 'cause this is a new a new store a gun in their has a great new store smell you ever noticed that it was like everything's fresh and new\nBut are you ah ever considered like a bending green grocer underneath that or something just to help people out if they've never seen one before or did that now I'm Sorry like a attending the same as a smart and final extra green grocers now that would be\nThat'd be okay if tapped by our uh our marketing people but it's yeah\nThe one thing I had a ... back on the history just for a second where's the headquarters of Mr smart Mr finals company Los Angeles California still back home and they and they started there\nThat's and we're very large in the west yeah out out there they're well that's my next question how many stores do you have a link looting both over extra and over two hundred normal to hundreds of mostly focused on the west coast\nCracked and into Arizona Phoenix market a Las Vegas and up into other parts of Nevada well let me go let me\nContinue my story about my first um [noise] a visit to a smart and final extra never been a smart and final\nBut when I went in there the first thing that literally leaped out at me was your produce department and I don't know if other people that have just come to smart and file lecture for the first time had the same impression but it's right in front of you and you walk in the front door and it is amazing [noise]\nUh and I asked you about that because I'm I'm In Scottsdale and the Safeway guy not because it's the brand is just close to my house\nAnd uh you know they do a decent job on a produce and snus doesn't nice job you're you know everybody doesn't bouquet job but you are like over the top good it just jumps out at you or how do you how do you do that how do you make that happen\nWell our company we within our company we own our own produce company itself so or wind is that we limited the middleman there and uh we get product or every other day\nSo we're constantly getting fresh product and we had some very good training with some people that we have here we have some people that really just took to the produce and um they just keep it in wonderful shape\nThis may not be the case in on every item but [noise] I'm a Honeycrisp apple guy [laughter] bags and so when I saw that posts department that's where I went I went to the apple a section\nAnd uh my experience on that day that smart and final extra that I was able to buy beautiful honeys Chris apples for a dollar Ninety eight a pound\nAnd the other store that I shop at their their average not average their daily prices three Ninety eight pound and what's on sale two Ninety pounds\nUm how is it that you're able to um\nA cell that high quality because you also have an organic here we'll talk about that in the second but how are you able to do that at a sixty percent let's say fifty percent ... percent cheaper how how's that happens\nA lot of times when we have hot pricing like that on that department or anywhere else in the store are really not making anything and sometimes they're losing money on it just to getting people in the store and seeing what we're about and\nIs that the if I have the term ready to go at a loss leader on ...\nYeah non quality but on the price itself\nYeah a loss leader for the quality so if the yeah the price of customers and go and that sort of thing is a central not just the the the pricing itself but ah the the ability to serve that kind of thing to a community like this we had a show on in this time slot or months and months back with Dr Don Wagner he's here on Thursdays\nIt's locked the months and months back with Dr Don Wagner he's here on Thursdays and sometimes he would talk about food deserts and these are communities that are either just too small to support a large a selection of grocery stores or there are so isolated that they don't have a good produce and people in the communities don't need it well\nBut this sort of thing that smart and final helping bring to his community it seems like is a not only the quality of the produce but the competition required to encourage other businesses to say hey I think we can step it up\nA little bit more well I tell you my personal experience I've just you know I Will confess to all the other grocery stores I have only buy produce ... extra since that happened about a five six weeks ago [noise] um\n[noise] but uh the um the timing you know to get something you know an apple orange ... all that stuff has to go from a tree to a box to a truck to your store who's figure\nAnd all that out you got some produce guys enough angel way out of\nMy hands that yeah that we do we have buyers and uh we have you know they're sourcing the small over the world all of them wherever they can get the sudden they deal with brokerage houses and stuff and it's I mean it's nothing that none of the other chains are not doing I mean I think everybody's doing it but uh our people are doing a very good job they currently\nYeah but it just even though you know it's it happens in other stores just that that process is pretty amazing that they can uh you know you you go and you buy something and it says product of Mexico Honduras or\nYet again Tina everywhere we all have bananas I mean just think what I had that got here and it's pretty incredible it was with a whole food chain\nIf it's all logistics process I mean you used to see those commercials on TV about they would just do a bunch of a pastiche shots of a middle America and harvesting grain and people throwing an apple up in the years like logistics would result over and over you know that I go to hunters\nAbout once a month and I can tell you that I see the Dole and the Chiquita a semi trucks loaded up with bananas\nAre they pick 'em green courses and then they ah get him to they had it they obviously have a timed out after hundreds of years and they know when it's to get to the store but that whole process of a bunch of bananas in the back of a semi truck in Honduras\nGetting on a ship or a plane wherever they get it here to Los Angeles for getting on a truck and it's for us there to pick up in Bullhead city Arizona that's kind of a fascinating story and in of itself\nAnd all the labor disputes and the stuff from hundreds of years ago and all that moving forward\nOrganic um department of your ... I saw that I'm not I'm not a big organic purchaser but ah it seems to be something that's very popular because you have a lot of\nIt well today a week counted a hundred and fifty one currently in our story this morning of just different products which is a hundred and fifty one organic organic alone ... of all those pretty much we have like items and your normal regular sock also but yeah that's pretty that's pretty large\nWhat is it in most cases I guess for a produce to be able to say organic is referring to the pesticides used on it or non GMO were what sort of things are quality\nThey got it that place I mean down to the search and uh we opened didn't show a fire I mean we had we had a couple of setbacks at a fire about a week before which today and our grand opening a one week but a fire department was wonderful they took care of it they you know a minimum a damage with water and uh we uh\nI didn't even hear about now I remember I saw here's here's what I remember there was a set date and you were making a big deal out of this grand opening up your your advertising everywhere there's a lot of ducks in a row the majority I see on this\nDay shift and I love to chat with him about that but um [noise] uh but there was a lot of media about you coming oh yeah and then in the Mojave daily news and I read it or electronically on the phone so it comes out at eleven forty five at night so I read the paper by midnight of the day before that comes out\nAnd I saw that there was a fire at the smart and final extra store and I said gee they're supposed to open in a week that's going to set back\nSo how did you pull out altogether after a fire in a store one week before open\nWhile we have it in tremendous marketing and merchandising team and within our company you know that you know they that they set up over the last couple of years we've set up a lot of news doors\nSo they've seen a lot of things hit them and I they were kind of ready for this or where we're at the first person to have something like this happen but are they just had a lot of people working very hard I\nDon't want a rubber neck but what did the fire actually affect within the store\nIt really didn't do anything we weren't we had roast chickens [laughter] housing smoked meat you know we uh we didn't have any uh any the\nGroceries in this none of our fixtures really and that and the thing it was so into construction part so it was just uh some uh begins of wiring issue they never really\nMuch they they fixed it you opened and as I understand from the uh\nSo that if you might say they fixed it you opened and as I understand from the are the least the news reports you open to just record crowds come into your store hours days\nIt was it was crazy I've never seen anything like it and uh you know we just had sales of even since we open the doors of a beat expectations in our economy goal so pretty happy\nOne thing that ah that also would not go with what I thought a smart and final store was being office products is a meets as I said you have a fresh meat department yesterday as well yeah and that is a year\nButchers yourself no we we really don't do meet cutting we can wear were set up for it but uh other than the preparation of roasted chicken that we do there and uh it's everything's pretty much comes to us packaged and we can break stuff down if we need to\nBut uh we we do a lot of big book sizes and that's where a lot of the restaurants they come in and buy their pork and their shoulders and they're you know steaks and whatever\nTouching back on the story on the liquor ... old dumped tell us into the meats if I can uh you you didn't really mentioned at least I didn't hear you on the liquor department you know that's a pretty competitive business okay and if you go to ... and Wal Marts and other stores in this area is Mrs unsafe ways that\nI think that's the competition in here um how are you how are you in that range or you pretty competitive\nI think we are very competitive there's still some learning we have to do you know or fight to sometimes you August could be giving subway maybe cheap and you should or have you priced too high and we've had a lot of input from our upper management we have some people there are regional vice president's been very\nVery hands on man and he uh he's he's sharp we shop they shop competitions they know local trends and other trends in other markets and they try to get its priced in a you know you know integrated sluggish yeah\nYou know one thing here is we have a lot of tourists that come here we have a lot of people that come for sporting events where a a sports tourism city if you want to you know it's very very big a part of the community and a and weekend for like Labor Day or how is your Labor Day\nIt's busy [laughter] or holidays or a they especially over the last few years of really there's this whole area with the improvements on the beaches in the area and such is brought in a whole new group of people that come out here because I can I can\nPicture people pulling up than there are votes or a trucks and they're on the way to the beach for the day or they're on the way to the to the votes on the lake or the river for the day pull on there and they go loading up\nOh yeah and you find that ice and a soda vierra you barbecue meets a as any supplies\nHave not been a problem with people parking their votes in the parking lot coming up and running all the pavement up a dollar [laughter] now [laughter] so they pulled the plug before either [laughter] [noise]\nUm [noise] the other thing too is that um are we also have a tremendous amount of winter visitors um which were actually experiencing coming in right now it's happening now is um so I Would think that uh you know they're\nHere or are looking for you know I have to say I'm confident the Bullhead city is one of the great communities of knowing how to find the best deal you know what I'm saying they're they're great shoppers they and they I think they learn it from\nOh yeah we'll hear I hear it all day long if they'll suddenly when we're out of line and yeah I got this and ... and everybody out there has a great\nPrice on or not the most affordable city in America for a reason okay that's the reason we that we have great shoppers in this community\nThere's one thing I think Bullhead city could stand to get a little bit better with especially considering all the uh visitors from all over the country that come here is they've got a very southwestern flare that's where you are but I have not been able to find anything more German and sauerkraut and the city I looked for rain baloney everywhere can't find them there's nowhere\nNo fresh sausage either most places I I haven't seen\nAny German sections in a grocery store that maybe they should uh you know figure that out but on the winter visitors\nOr your store is kind of a hybrid\nBetween a Costco and a regular grocery store or at least that's mine that's that's a good ... and that's kind of feel for it you have an OLC option if you want it yeah and also get smaller I don't want to have to buy forty pounds of apples only won three you know\nAnd but you have these winter visitors visitors coming and they know they're going to be here for a few months or they might stack up are stocked up on a you know twelve Rosa paper towels at a good these you know cheap prices and inexpensive prize or what's the\nRecipe on there when they exit when they can always tell when they're leaving 'cause uh my shelves just get infected with items that specialty items that they can't maybe get back in Nebraska and a lotta lotta Hispanic a lot of our you know Mexican products that kind of stuff that was a popular in the mid west\nOf course then you've got the regatta visitors that just want to fill a cooler that's how she got that right yeah it's when they did a very good job of its opposition\nCooler that's got that right yeah when they do a very good job of it is now does this say when you know there's a a holiday coming you ... you you're you and your suppliers are in sync you know what you need to twenty seven years you kind of get a feel for you know I had to go down pretty well our whole team did actually and uh but\nThis is a learning curve now what's going on right now the numbers are crazy when we come back I Want to talk about the future of grocery shopping we're talking about Web shopping drones all that kind of stuff so uh\nWe'll get into the high tech shopping at smart and final extra in Bullhead city in just a few

I mean those are big ticket items there that you're not putting in their against Chris sales and granted sale is great against you know left handed hitters\nBut man at some point you have to say I think my guy is just as good as their guy\nAnd with what I saw was sale last night and then I did strike out some guys that they get seven strike out seven or eight\nBut I still have to play the odds here of getting my better player in there are better players will so we'll see how that works\nYou know the game is changing right before our very eyes and it's a shame that we're not looking at starting pitching the way we once did and that is you give the guy ball and you go out there and hey I Want to close it was the last time we had a complete game in the world series did you find that make what I was still operating okay shouldn't be that hard to find\nIn other words we have an effort that we are going to happen now so what I asked about eight thirty to this morning east coast time\nYeah OK kind of slipped by during breakfast [laughter] okay [noise] okay sorry [laughter] I don't know how much I think that's the only thing I ask for today\nPretty much so I gave you the the the ramp schedule that was a good time\nThat's not hard to find that so but thank you\nI'm I'm guessing maybe Justin Berliners blast gun Madison Bumgarner\nDon't know those are the names that stand out doesn't take long to coal role vote somebody who's going to complete a game of the world series\nYeah I gotta I gotta Johnny ... mix\n...\nYeah I gotta I gotta Johnny ... mixed in here ...

many calls you a genius and then you gotta keep living up to the gene\nWhen somebody calls you genius\nThen you gotta keep living up to the genius because I don't think the Tony La Russa couldn't ignore analytics\nOh you're\nI I always thought you know when when a manager says I have a gut feeling uncomfortable with that ... years feeling with your team in that moment uncomfortable with that it just feels like gosh\nDo we send Kirk Gibson to the plate he can barely walk he can barely swing and he's going to face a hall of famer and Dennis Eckersley\nI'm no no I don't think we're going to give me to the plate here the computer says you know with a guy who is going to the you know what the give away would have been wouldn't give these using a walk her to get to the plate that's when you probably know this wouldn't be a good idea yes but\nThat's actually dad was in ... left the if you can get a left the out on if you can pick up on a stretcher analytic say put them out there lefty righty\nHome you know you and your match up their eyes to a gym told me as a working for the major league baseball network coverage from Fenway begins today it's three and we'll feature and there'll be tonight airing before and after every game they do a great job and it's good to have the hall of famer back on the program Jim good morning how are you\nAll its great how's everything that's been a long time my friend other than go great\nYeah we're just trying to figure this out with the analytics that when you know that the un Christian on the mound the Dodgers go All right handed so I got three guys who hit at least twenty five home runs and I got the analytic saying I Can't put them up there against Chris shale\nWhat do you make of this\n[noise] well look I think the analytic having been a big part of where I think we've become more we're heading for it and it it's about numbers by the way I Would send it'd be up there just so you know okay\nI was upset and he'll be I Would have saying give me up with as they did as Tony as now is Tom and it was sort of did at the time but you know the the analytics or interesting because you know I also work with the White Sox and and\nThere's a lot of information being put out there and I think I I Do believe that that some of it is good and I do believe that you have to go off of wisdom to time in history\nAnd just being around the game and as you said a minute I was listening in the gut feeling and I think what made all of those managers great\nIs that they had those good feelings they had\nYou know they may be set okay Kirk Gibson came to hit that back door ... or even though he is hurt\nYou know Eckersley didn't throw hard but maybe at that moment he could have done that you know granted he was hurt but he could still get to that wrap around ... or\n... when he did which you know that's why I respect the guys that do have the guts the only for all those analytical guys that bring the information down and they put it in front of you I think there is value to that as\nI got a\n... even though you know when you hit six hundred home runs\n[laughter] I mean you had to take somebody deep a few times here\n[laughter] let me pull you we have Clemens were checking we have eight people working on this right now okay I Love\nIt yeah see it looks like he's got eight eight against Clemens a sauce anyway I started ...\nWe ... we always know ride around\n[laughter] that's Kamal Clemens was listening now he'd probably want to buzz the tower on you for calling them out like this\nThat's okay I got right back\nIn that they aren't you a big country boy you just get right back up there and you take your God she rushing dirt on a gym and you're okay that's right yeah that's right that's it hits here in the in the head [laughter] did he may throw at you like did you ever feel like you know what that's the purpose now\nNo I don't really I mean look look I was on the play I was all I was all over the place I wanted to create\nBy strike so I I wanted to leave everything out of the equation of an umpire calling the ball way\nCharlie manual on I when when when I turn when everything started turning for me for the right direction I think getting in on the plane was the best thing I ever did and and I felt like I control the strike so now I struck out a bunch\nBut I still felt that if if they made a mistake I was going to have the play coverage to cover the area\nYou know like I I got ... smoking you want\nThings he did I remember yeah\nBut but okay who's the guy you're not going out and do that you would give paused to go out to the mound\n\nNo one could you imagine if look look if a if it's called for and you get smoke or you know like the way the game plays out and you get hit like\nYou go to them I mean that's just baseball that's that's how you're supposed that's how you earn respect you know for your from your teammates if you get hit\nI mean ...\nYou're from your teammates if you get hit\nA man shot I don't think you every time looking to charge them up and you can get a feel during the game the other guys purposely like throwing behind you and then\nYou know like like yeah it's got to end you know ultimately you know that's why retaliation you don't you don't see I I feel you don't see you're not in a lot of retaliation but I Do I Do believe guys will ...
