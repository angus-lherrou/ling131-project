live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that was basically is happening is\nA a level of if you're going to find it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy either play right now one is a is you're honest and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the Tory in fine which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because you're honest in tourist is in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable sign that it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize established banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history\nOr that and because of the reforms of the banks those reforms has slowly been shipped part by Reagan and\nReforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same time demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the majority who have not so much wealth\nIs so exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it\nIs a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability button its negative it's about destroying from getting the house back\nGetting the Senate back but for what it's not really defined itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against I hear it every day here 'cause I live in the very heart of it sure but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said don't go a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it'll happen because if you're ... anybody but\nClinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally age you don't have anything to replace him except your wife turned down and then and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and\nIt's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it is really quite and this classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or something it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from your cells\nAnd you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been talking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really a hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day\nAnd starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if red voters threat American voters go to the polls early especially in other areas which\nWill be in the early times on hold on for a second

come together and have more common ground but that petered out\nBy may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy\nWill Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise] uh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both\nHave the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise]\nSo uh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survived this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president oh\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and\nTry and taking notes yeah taking off and it's like yeah I mean literally as all of our family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um\nEvery everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in its fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the the blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really win voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president\nAccording to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote\nI said ... ... yeah I said ten months\nBefore Trump was a ... a elected I said the the big upset could happen through their um and so it's it's my sense is that\nAnd so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats just switching back and forth and in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance\nSo it's it's just more and I my sense\nIs the next two years are going to be even more this functional than anything we've seen before and it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of the margins it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly astrology are saying that\nThey're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of having all in all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh my articles than that Kevin I Would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not thing they should be looking at according to their needs\nIt if you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so a lot\nBut I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planets of next year and into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two\nMajor corporate establishment will to power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great massive and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call my hope I'm wrong\nI Wish I was more [laughter]\nAnd he recently were on the History Channel show called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities leading ...\nYeah uh it was um [noise]\nIt was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show\nUh I mean to you have to kind of talk about something that happened uh

with fear the effects of this fire and that made a lot of sense to me too because\nThat was you know that was I was in the spirit that didn't affect me and my guess is that fast I mean it was God's burning ... percent so that was the message that I understood from it and then\nOf course I said I and many and many my wicked deny so it helped me a message of this many of these creatures there but

basically praying for the return of Christ you were praying for ... for the return of Christ [noise]\nUh you know and uh he basically encouraged me in and went through a whole series of whether I had face to believe this could happen to that could happen and\nAnyway that's that's the last part of the story but in the end he said well if I gave you the power to you know have crashed return right now would you do it and as\nThere's too many people that need to be saved yet\nThat's what I'm saying I mean yeah I Know that we we love Christ you want to see 'em but once you'd come that's it right

me I knew that he wanted me to stop praying and didn't want me to pray for these cells I give them a second chance you know because they didn't have it here and I felt I bonded with these people I've befriended the people I knew them I didn't hang out with him because they were kind of like I said live wicked in their ways but I still could relate I can relate to anybody\nAnd I can relate to these things I can laugh at them and you know I have to talk with him and stuff like that so I felt like I I Know that he and I just couldn't just I felt helpless for them when they when I heard that they die from accidents and overdoses and\nAnd and I just felt terrible for them and I felt like they're going to be in a in this in this fifth dimension a and heading towards the ... and I was just saying you know God you know if you can\nPray for the cells and can you do whatever you can for them over there maybe talk to them or something like that or I teach them you know what that there are there

I ... did in I moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep\nIt took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed oh what a madman events so wise as this\nAnd then when my head was well in the room I ended the lantern cautiously also cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek\nI ended it just so much that a single then raise fell upon the vulture high end this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nForce was not the old man who ... me but his evil lie and every morning when the day broke I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and a hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve I looked in upon him widely slept\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious and opening the door a watches minute hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of mice aghast city I could scarcely contain

me for a moved on the bed certainly as if startled\nNow you may think that I drew back but you know\nHis room was this black is pitch with the the darkness for the shutters were close fasten through fear of robbers\nAnd so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily I had my head in and was about to open that lantern when my phone's slipped upon the tin fascinating and the old man's spring up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down\nHe was still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night harkening the death watches and the wall presently\nI heard a slight grown and I knew it was the grownup mortal terror it was not a grown the pain or of grief it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with all\nI knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world's slapped it was wild up from my own ... deepening with the dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me\nI say I knew it well I knew what the old man felt pity him although white chuckled at heart\nI knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he turned into bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him\nHe had been trying to fancy them cause less but could not he had been saying to himself it is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single Cher\nLike this cat

strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your reports said\nWorse than ever before um but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see\nSo much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that you know nobody touch screen may argue but I've actually\nFound the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington

twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh\nI was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that was basically is happening is\nA a level of if you're gonna defined it in plants there's two major planets ... political strategy their play right now one is a is you're honest and just recently come in to tourists\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it\nFavors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because you've run us into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable sign that it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German third rice and being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize established banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth it's almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability button its negative it's about destroying Trump\nSituation the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house back\nGetting sent back but for what it's not really defined itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it you're a but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if it if you follow this pattern with much more energy to it that happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said\nWell the Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six\nI was on a show in Portland [noise]\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it'll happen because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally age you don't have anything to replace him except your wife tearing down and then what\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and\nIt's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it is really quite and\nThis classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sign it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from yourself\nAnd you know I have been held a long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been talking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is\nReally at hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where you are on us as going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around of just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day\nAnd starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if red voters Fred American voters go to the polls early especially in the areas which\nI not only guarantee you love our blondes are offer a fit or free guarantee meaning if you belong don't fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd that ... has made it even easier checkout lines there's no tool cellular shades the first and only shades installed without screws or tools coast to coast listeners take up to fifty percent off any order just use

E. R. dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBy the way of used ... dot com for some home projects they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different vendors and names and the other all qualified picked the one you want but\nSuperb workers John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions jar we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many of come true already\nWell uh there have been a number I'm more of a shocking than my my cross the what I did it is basically short um chapters that takes us being and\nI'm chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nDefinitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was or you're honest in the last chance sec style that look at the play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may\n... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third\nProphecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and that looks like that's definitely happening [noise] ah I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both\nHad the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave and scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January\nSo ah it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters said get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see in eleventh hour or close to the polls are turning around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\nOh what's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly\nWatching this and try and taking notes yeah taking off and it's like yeah I mean literally is a large family members and other things\nAre are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody who watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nAre they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side of the hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\n... ... yeah I said ten months\nBefore Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats the same number of seats just switching back and forth and in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance\nSo it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\n... units almost unbearable now\nWell it's I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolution\nAt the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and say it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly astrology are saying that\nI'm not going to see it a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of having all in all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I've said very clearly in my back in August eleventh my articles than that Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs [noise]\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset\nBy this Supreme Court no I don't think so why a lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn\nThe defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two\nMajor corporate establishment will to power that you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great massive and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people start really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope\nI'm wrong I was you know it was more [laughter]\nRecently were on the History Channel will show called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course is done on this fire for

have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs as in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is that Iran is if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion\nAnd unpredictability button its negative it's about destroying from getting the house back\nGetting sent back but for what it's not really defined itself is what we know what the resistance is against I hear it all every day here because I live in a very hard\nIt's against the hero every day here because I live in the very heart of it sure but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if it if you follow this pattern with much more energy to it then it happened before 'cause I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said\nOh God Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland [noise]\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later\nI said well no it'll happen because if you're ... anybody but\nClinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your wife turned down and then and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news that it is really quite and\nThis classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or sorry it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from your cells\nAnd you know I had been how long long time first with art and then with the huge orange I've been talking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really a hand now it's um\nIt's not going to be when I look at when I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that\nIf if red voters red American voters go to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which\nWill be in the early times hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of

a number of different vendors and names and uh they're all qualified picked the one you want but\nSuperb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\nWell uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking than my my eighth crop the what I did it is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then look at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of of the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nDefinitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was a year out of the last ... effect style that looked at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground\nBut that petered out by may\nAnd that scene in a way\nI'm In twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise] uh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both\nHad the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January\nSo ah it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters they get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in the week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see in eleventh hour or\nClose to the polls are turned around so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president oh\nWhat's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and\nTry and taking notes yeah taking notes and it's like yeah I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody who watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the the blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president\nTo my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\n... ... you know I said\nTen months before Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats the same number of seats just switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance\nSo it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\nAnd it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge and it's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identity you think of a way to get out of this merge and say it's going to have to get much worse and frankly it's Stalin Gees are saying that\nThey're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're we're\nWe're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of having all in all the small fighting about that [noise] is it I said very clearly in my back in ...\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh my articles than that Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed rushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so a lot but I\nTell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planets of next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people start really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate Lee control the United states\nAnd so that's that's\nMy call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter] Henry\nSimilar we were on the

[laughter]\nThe the thing is that the we are seeing him a moment coming in this century and the first half of the century where religions will see the other side of the prophecies the part the doors been shot too and there's indications in prophecy\nIn Christian prophecy even that shows that what's on the other side of this revelation will completely change the concept and leave behind even the identity of what was the Christian what it was to be Muslim what it wants to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door\nAnd what's on the other side is completely different that's all I can do right now\nI I Can't let the night go by without asking you about the middle east will start taking phone calls and winding up your for you what's your take cynically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria and Iran and this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it follows the prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made and Tim predictions for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and it is always long story short the\nThe not Saddam has properties that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this was a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagles cut them countries get pulled

America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours is there we've rescinded a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five of course it

reasons why the Islamic that's why they turn the Shabab revenge ally\nYes and so so this bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side uh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally\nSo so we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates\nWho we've been supporting and that's just the city in Syria\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um ... organ of ... or ... the president of turkey and water and food and\nGot together and made a pact to not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are are refugees\nAll crowd in that area owns a horrible what\nGood about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened\nKnow from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... stage and film the White Helmets and who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them and some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still is he started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime had chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused a you know we have thirty Russian warships as this time around\nAnd then a mere equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a nuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm the astrology kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to a long and short deadline if if we kinda move up what maybe the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce they had achieved a parity in March first this year they delayed they're putting delayed his address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted law this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a Harley report and so the Russians declared in March first is pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something it's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically that's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed we're doing the same thing\nAnd it collapsed we're doing the same thing so uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and who was considered the Swedish ... case the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and traps\nAnd he he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like Soviet Union at least in this economic sense\nThat's true ah with more censorship is happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say from my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with than the country I grew up with\nNo that's true in in ... in the last minute it's we before the break them will take final colds next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide ... this this intrigues me why are you doing this\n[noise] well I've been watching Anthony Bourdain since two thousand five I've learned so much\nHis unique rebellious but brilliant unorthodox way of kind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate in my travels\n... it's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach to really meet with people when people break break bread they they they it it's a

in just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and\nBoy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide hot it most people and counter I'm basically in the ...\nAll encounter um basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up\nWith your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in but in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained and so this\nIs one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of my life from all these years I've never known this way I was I was\nI was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park because I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me as as I could just keep walking a beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible and clear out to see how they're really one there really there are plenty of complementary Z or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was I tried to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to for all myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise up out of the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be telling you know not at all [laughter] and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little old eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves in Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree existence love me existence sees\nEvery thing that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel in significant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an a it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about the whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the messiah has a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something that looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of the rack and looks at it and it's the people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I've watched how she touched his cheek\nOn the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that

literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that that they it's their own

everything they're lobbying if this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very obvious\nYeah that was the uh that was the open to the show last night now if there's any doubt anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party at how they want it so chaos where we should have calm where they want to rebel routes\nAnd intimidate instead of show

you you'll walk I watch anything like that you can sit there and read it it's totally a lead in closed rooms so nothing's going to trade said they're considering they're read a recent report\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and um and then they can leave that for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before or something like that leaks out\nBottom line is how many and abuse to have to do are\nAs many tasted the latest pass the election\nThe law as many that takes the delay this past the election that's what\nThe hell out there on a card so that the current day I'm going down on this and don't you don't get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this weekend\nI think they should they should not be any more delays you do the best you can do\nIn the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to allegedly offer\nAnd only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a is going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that bear\nOut and they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental you know they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with\nOr who said yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it as well as those that are opposed to the\n... we have enough down here the bill bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that ah the FBI ... testimony from former classmates of cabin all these are people that went to Yale with them and uh they ... the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegation the problem is that you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo would the FBI proved those people are they just seem to not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line is first of all it's coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses to that they're not permitted on the stand in a court of law never mind are doing this and you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know calm and what does\nMake sense to do and none of these people make sense than anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody and\n... well again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense for and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here are the bureau's gotta get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out that the the the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from ... from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know look here has got to take a black guy from the other side of that was I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of you know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background\nOf some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not\nReporting properly what the role the FBI is\nBut you see the ignorance it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be sacred this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we right there's a combination of everything that you said or bottom line is the some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on that's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that uh that the judge Kavanaugh was killed\nWell I Believe that the judge Kavanaugh was guilty but you can't look at the facts and come up with that conclusion but they do\n... haven't here on the lower income show bell thanks so

five\nForty Laura I'm much time we have James Earl right when they're thirty seconds are coming out Mark Penn I he's going to give us a snapshot\nUnaware the mid term election cycle is and I'm gonna ask him whether the Democrats\nPlayed this game way too long of delay\nAnd whether you know they really they just overplay their hand it's overplay their hand here and extreme do they look too extreme\nFor the American people now and how will that affect a midterm election turnout if at all a five five forty Laura\n[noise]\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new

signed cooperation are not well what we find in the polling is that sixty percent said well look there's no collaboration them\nIn fact the nomination should be confirmed and that included eighty six percent of Republicans Democrats or do you\nLook Democrats even after there's no ... sixty percent of Democrats [noise] you know would oppose the nomination but you see that sort of the center\nOf the country says hey if I could see that there is no cooperation I'm going to be fair if you're not going to ruin a this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no cooperation and that's certified by the FBI are\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree\nUh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey hum who took white women to task after the Trump election ... who's helping him get elected providing him with\nFifty two percent of their support ... faith focused her remarks on college educated white women\n... faith focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent whom of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support\nAmong Republican women had dropped finite teen points oh that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people\nVoting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the geography\nBut I think that is the the biggest\nBut both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and victory points to the Democrat so far which is that the closet what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women\nWho voted twenty points for Romney's who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for uh for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never felt that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominees for what might have been more conservative ... would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues that Trump is\nFocused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us see\nUh LA Times poll counted twenty per ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points\nThey had a much bigger\nOr they had a much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is this is a substantial block or the married college educated\nWomen and that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump tone women like things calm things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and\nThey seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe the stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof\nWomen whom as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message clicked every day every day that the the national question is is she\nRapists or not\nThis is David openings focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know in the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home in the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states than show\nAgain the races are tightening in do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump did see data that shows that this is driving conservative a conservative voting base up back home of course he didn't Joe\nPlays exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case white male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion\nIs driving even more men though to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far in that\nFor ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare and the energy politics as a as a moderate Democrat\nYou know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here\nIs that the Democrats were completely energize they were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message\nIncredibly disorganized and I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base\nAnd I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately\nUh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you're going to see it kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you\nSee what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination uh the the party when it's United is pretty formidable\nI mean even a bunch of older white guys it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing that I could see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTightened up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted for the courts for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see confirmatory in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job and I didn't believe there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or you say has stepped up ... maybe some people think right leaving some people\nThere are too harshly but as you said you stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I have to run or less\nIt's right or left and it said Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should have left to let this thing it'd be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now I'm Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nEight five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people that Trump was\nEmbodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote are some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news is if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in his basic principle of fairness and would mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nAnd political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote get a

again I think people's\nVS detector or when they really step back take politics out of it there's a lot that doesn't make sense about this and again\nI Hope I and I hope I wish nothing but the best for Christine Ford and all these people but you cannot condemn a man or a woman\nOn unsubstantiated allegations and just because someone a man or woman makes an allegation\nDoesn't mean it is true\nDoesn't mean necessarily seen big cases of the media celebrated over from the Duke lacrosse case to UVA rape case and they were false and everybody had egg on their faces Jennifer and Indiana line too\nHigh I was calling because I I'm a white woman here in Indiana\nAnd I'm I'm just tired of being categorize I'm tired of white women I I listen to your show and the polls they've been giving I think these pollsters are dead wrong and I think they're going to shock in November just like they were shocked before because I may be a white woman that I can think critically and\nI wouldn't want my son was they forget to realize it's not just white limit when then we have a son who has since we have father I mean I Would never want my son lives\nLike there's a that's a good way of ending at thank you so much will take a break we have a lot more to go to David Limbaugh is going to stop by here's another new book out and a lot more say there\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be ... and where does exactly the losers Tom Kelly studio a biology teacher Mickey and every American sort of are from the ... served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing to do to help protect yourself from room to where\nThe buck up your computer often\nIf you have questions about identity theft and even if you're struggling with fraud to the ... or ...\nGreat thanks for having me on a of Savage Tim relentlessly and shamelessly and morally and what's going on is a microcosm of the the existential struggle we're in with the left today\nAnd it's why I Am so happy that we have a a general in charge and Donald Trump because he fights back and all these purists\nHe's never Trump purists who who think that he doesn't have the right manners they sit on the sidelines expect us to be passive and meanwhile the country's being taken from us by these relentless people on the left\nAnd and just the Democrats are just so shameless and they're almost a parody of themselves they said they wanted the FBI investigation that was never about Kavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any original is on there they want somebody who will preserve\nTheir judicial manufactured right to abortion so\nThat they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting like pre announce that they would reject him and it's despicable I'm sick of our\nOur side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll put the nail to the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the\nMost qualified and and and one one of those digs employ people find judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of\nAnd intimidation rabble rousing in chaos and meanwhile Trump is slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is it costs\nIs delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is in Congress this fall but we did read it NAFTA he's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than seven of all federal judges are Trump\nAppointees uh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past\nTrump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say uh well the reason you guys want Trump is just because of gorgeous well no you're not just because of him is because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes\nUh and its regulations it's better trade deals that say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there who will fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity and realize that we're in a in a in a serious battle\nTo preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is\nAnd where mccaskey and all the others are college but I'm hoping with this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the the audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church in your new book a Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nUh you're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ... ...\n... in in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand\nHow the early church was formed how unlikely it was that the followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and devote their entire lives and and give their lives or to this ah this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ or\nTell us about why this book was you know what so important for you to write at this point in your own life\n[noise] ah well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible because I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started\nInhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I add something some some books some guys in ... that would help me understand it better be less intimidated shows I've studied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back\nAnd start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last book I wrote was about the gospels\nAnd a ... foot paraphrased in and stay to most of the verses and the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book\nJesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church\nOr which follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed that he planted and they were they were dissipating from the the true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of\nOf adversity and opposition and secular influences corn and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I'd dollar tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix and secret ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back\nAnd we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's the conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel\nWhich is faith then Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to ... to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books is to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely\nOf Christ disciples Paul\nPaul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law and when and he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were new competing religion but that they were perverting\nThe religion of God and and it was Judy as well as a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be them aside because they expect\nOutraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be the messiah because they expect that the Jews expected a military our political I deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nAnd I didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was a hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory he didn't even raise a hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't meet on the side and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the same ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus wrote blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelists So Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and that in that periphery of the Roman empire and sadness churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the safe as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him in the Bible says before he created the universe\nAnd I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual relentless\nAnd determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is like around two fifty seven in your book um\nWhere you talk about how the apostle Paul\nCorrected obviously and the letters Corinthian church um and it it was the way he did it was not with condemning Atari language or\n[noise] you know railing at the end planning a thing as they are going to turn all damnation but it was with with love and respect and you talk about how that's a great lesson and I think I Need to take that lesson\nSomething that we all do um because it's easy to get you know upset or demoralized or even angry at people when they don't see what you see but that's not really the way to change minds\nNo and he can argue people into the kingdom when we got to be a little different than we are in politics but you know you don't want to be too strident and\nHe what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews who would adopt their practices when as long as they didn't violate\nHis basic core principles there's around Greeks he would do what they did he was talking with invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and to relate to them and then he was present the truth of the universe and the gospel\nOf salvation through Jesus Christ\nAnd it was kind of reminds me of one of my favorite apologist today Ravi Zacharias he says when we approach people in a van july's and tell them about to say\nWe want to understand the question or as much as the question they asked meet them where they are understand where they are because you're not going to for rape somebody into the kingdom you have to tell them

country and if we fall down on our job it will change and it will go away and I think it will become very bad however\nIt's not the battle that you think it is you've been convinced by media and

great great guy and good thinker\n'em and they have the stats and the book and they have different things we've ... we were concentrating just for a second on millennials because I Know David is seen it and I've seen it because we're doing it with mercury one\nAnd when you present the facts to millennials if you're not trying to when they say wait a minute what\nDavid talk about a few of the millennials that we have had in for our two week you know training course and they have actually come\nA little hostile sense right yeah we have a number of Columbus skeptics here to disprove us that showed that were all wrong and\nIt's All right you know we don't we don't run from that situation would you roast them and say let's have a conversation as long as you engage in the Congress right and so we start asking them questions and you know they have their opinions but we just ask them questions and it's kind of like they sit back and uh I don't know\nAnd so once you ask the questions that lead them to affirmation\nIt's amazing to see that they didn't take those questions or go back to those that taught them and change that we literally we have a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions\nHe got all the photo because he didn't know the answers he now has asked her to meet with him once a week and teach teach him what she learned and and all these classes it's amazing it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an ass or this is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources\nAnd she had him nailed down into he had never here's a professor that didn't know this stuff\nAnd economics professor and he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then show them the documentation\nAnd he said okay I I Want more because I clearly ... but that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys\nThat come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them and quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm I Love language if we don't make fun of you is because we don't like you say this though [laughter] so you know we we we kid and joke and I have a great great time\nBut they come out transform and there's some of the most mature individuals and these these guys are all\nIt's in their mind to become leaders and I tell you they are so so good and it's just amazing\nWe were at a meeting in February and we I don't think I've announced this formally uh may I David go for it um we are going to do black history month a museum here at our studios in February\nIf you don't think that's\nA little controversial um but we have worked on this and we're working on it with the Lincoln museum and uh it's gonna be a little mind blowing and really really eye opening to a lot of people on both sides uh and it's black history but you know not all the black history that everybody knows\nLet's tell the black history that really nobody knows a and that is going to be here at our studios in the month of February and yesterday we decided that because they're they're gonna we're gonna have do since we're gonna have people\nThat are going to tell these individual stories about these people in the ear on stage Nineteen as you've come through and they're all\nYou just left no anchor babies citizen goes citizenship goes from parents to child not to ... not child's apparent\nWow security risk can be deported and permanently banned from the United states the government must protect the borders during times of war states will have a definite role in immigration so that is what they that's what they did a ritual immigration law okay\nHow I found it fascinating in the book that we have\nArgued as if these things were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language how dare you insist as if this was just some\nDocuments in German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing he\nSaid we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was were separating from Great Britain 'cause he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nYet simulation I mean ... Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in their early use\nThese old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation they will infuse it into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render if a as heterogeneous incoherent and distracted mass\nHe says the solution it is thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this\nIt seems to me necessary this is Franklin seems to be necessary to distribute the um the German is the Germans are more equally mix them in with English established English schools that are now where they are now too sick we settled\nI Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for ... the great farmers\nHe's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite of what we're doing now know\nDearborn, Michigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them creating a parallel culture where as almost a no go zone now for for police\nSomalians in in um Minnesota exactly\nAnd we've got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move to whatever your country was\nYou come here to be an American now that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America is really bad ... you know we need we need to be like Europe or whatever\nOne way to lose it is is not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we don't we're not in the government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top now\nYou say that racial healing is\nFairly easy oh we have to do do it ... what what what is the plan for racial healing\nYou know that there are several things one is you've got to change some of your knowledge basis or find with millennials they are taught about race from the way the professor said and we showed them seven things that everyone needs to know about race and generally they don't the historical\nBut remember all stuffy headed with those are oh yeah there are several things of this the first permanent ... permanent slavery was introduced in America by black man Anthony Johnson who sued ... on other black man\nUh we show the fact that a ... forty three percent a free blacks in South Carolina on black slaves that allow one out of it yeah nearly half\nA one out of eight a Native Americans own black slaves and major tribes\nAnd that didn't stop that and even though the amounts of Asian proclamation when did slavery\nWas didn't name stop with thirteenth amendment when we abolish slavery because we only abolished slavery in the United states but Indian nations are their own nations right down by the way that they stopped it was years later it was probably a decade later before slavery stopped in Indian nations\nSo what we do show slavery is a human problem it is not a black white problem despite what your professors say\nIt is a problem and the way you view humankind\nSo we go through and and show for example Tim Scott and James Lankford in the U.S Senate have come up with with\nThis thing where you invite other people from other races to come eat a meal with you on Sunday come into your house and you know learning and touch you don't solve racism institutionally you saw that one percent of the time change in a hard time seeing people different\nNot having this black white polarization that we often try to make today\nHow worried are you David about the level of anger now\n[noise] level the anger is a real problem but what it what is derived from is is the bigger problem and the stereotypes and and and all these\nThings we really don't know each other and once you get to know each other and what you did this inter relational stuff like with millennials unlike with folks of other races and other groups once you start doing individual stuff that's where it breaks down\nAnd that's where you're able to demonstrate

expressing either condemnation or support\nHe spoke about memory and how it applies to both Kavanaugh and Ford you know how dangerous that is for him\nIf you were on the Glenn Beck program strike one you talk to them about Kavanaugh's strike too you didn't say an opinion on Kavanaugh strike three you're out yeah I mean any\nRegardless of his personal politics a lot of his listeners would be from

it bounces back\nThere's which they call this coup and counter coup injuries so you never know wearing the brains can be injured [noise] just because you know where the impact occurred mhm right so the whole mechanism is important but the brain can start to swell\nWhen it gets hit right and if it swells to the point where it it can it's too pressing the brand against this go you're going to decrease the amount of blood flows in and out\nAnd that happens you can go on and have a stroke that's rare takes pretty significant hit to the head but it can happen it's really interesting also the brain the relative moments of the different parts of the brain\nAs the movement to be a nurse ship moving one way one part of the brain may move more rapidly in in respect to another part of the brain and cost sharing forces they tear parts of the brain\nBecause it's not a solid in their brain is a massive sort of well it's not as you'll ... you'll also have to do but it's it's it it got scorched to it\nIt has a little squares to it that then and that's a medical term [laughter] so the sharing forces you know when\nWhen part of the brain is moving in your tearing right you can be sharing blood vessels will be carrying neurons and and so the symptoms from that then then there's more than a concussion right\nBut now you can get bleeding in the brain you get more swelling in the brain you can get herring right or what they call if you've ... you've actually torn neurons and it leads around those now you'll look at a scan\nNow that's something you'll see you'll see injury right you'll see little bleed that this little punch tape right that tells you that that can be very devastating because there's a whole area of the brain that can be affected and you can uh basically kill awful lot of neurons by doing that but that's\nThat's a little more severe than just a regular concussion but these can happen in the cause of forces\nThat's one of those things where you have an old story in the family is like oh Bobby got hit in the head with a baseball and he's never quite the same ...\n... that's exactly right usually takes more than one hit but it's good solid hit\nYou may not be the same or whatever whatever it was it might be partially apocryphal but you never quite the same afterwards but you know baseball\nI've seen a lot of injuries baseball baseball bats to hype Snow White of damage because they will cause depression and go\nAnd that can cause bleeding right at that point\nAnd you get a a human Tomas formation if it's ... around the skull area it might be tethered by one of the ... the in the brain itself the brain can be compressed significantly so there's all different types of human told me a depending on where in the brain it is you know for the elder people when they than this rapid movement of the brain\nBecause it's a little bit of atrophied to the brain or if somebody drinks heavily they get a little atrophy that actually puts them at risk for believes when they hit their head because of that movement can check tear blood vessels\nSo even mild head injury in older people or an alcoholic can render a severe believes that can lead to other problems with the brain so again never take even mild head injury\nYou know with a grain of salt it should always be taken serious and and of course looking at the symptoms you want to be able to put together you know figure out who's at risk for\nSerious injury versus those who are not and so what are some of the symptoms I think this is good we'll get to know about two minutes okay good good to talk about this for to mix them all come back with the ah the NFL particles are\nSo what signs or didn't tell us if you have severe or serious brain injury\nSo pain definitely is is a good symptoms to look at not just in the head conscious knowing the head but I'm Glad because we're talking about ... but but it's a constant is worsening it was a global or is it just at the point where of impact right you're sharp pain versus a you know\nWell you feel you know pressure in your head that expanding ... there maybe some you know the bleed it's expanding so\nSo worsening headache I think it is the best way to look at it or persistent headache and I think you suffered something like that\nQuite possible um motor dysfunction so if you if you've lost control of a of a limb you you're weak on one side or you're just uncoordinated something\nWhen ... you're weak on one side or you're just uncoordinated something to really think about\nLearn how to do that thing where you flip the coin ... and then ... can still do it yeah that that takes\nA lot more coordinated and then you think ... ... century changes so if you lost\nSight hearing tape the I'm I'm sensitive to lighter sound or if you did ... those are all symptoms that you want to definitely take seriously um if you're\nIf you're not able to focus of your little confused\nI'm your cognitive skills are off your disoriented in any way or you can't follow directions over tell you you know ... ten\nBackwards you know ... now from him back with someone and you don't know how to do that or you can't remember what they told you that something to be concerned about his speech if you're having trouble finding the right we're uh if you're not able to express yourself like you normally are\nAnd because one of them went on the road a suicide ... shock on himself as a child so that they could look at his brain\nAnd and they had a chance to yeah yeah\nUm she knew something was wrong deeply deeply wrong as a result of Sonia concussions night\nRight so so that they now they're going to start hopefully you know this is going to stop that kind of problem I'm like the most important thing is once somebody had a a a concussion in the NFL his daily monitoring okay and that's you know that's to what you said earlier\nI'm you know to getting good good history you know what's their medical history what was the concussion that they just suffered and more importantly what previous concussions had they had B that puts them at risk and and family history is well medical issues so the first step in\nIn all protocols should be but in in the NFL protocol is rats and and when they say rest they mean zero physical you're not doing any team relate whatsoever you totally removed from the team but in addition to not you're not running you're not doing any you know I'm I'm Jim work or anything um\nAnd the other thing is you're going to avoid electronics you know social media you're not going to get in on the on I'm On you to you know you're not going to Facebook your friends or your your followers\nI'm In no team meetings no team activities whatsoever and just designed to reduce stress as much as possible and and have them completely rest absolutely key\nAnd this this is going to happen until they're back to base line right so they're going to hopefully in the NFL is starting to do the neuro psych testing baseline so we know where they're at and then they're going to test them afterwards until they start to clear until they're completely clear\nAnd all their symptoms have resolved and then they can start to move toward some light aerobic activity\nAnd that's going to be completely under under some medical supervision so they're going to go into the uh the team facility and they're going to work you know to the white activity and they'll do that until they feel that their tolerating it and they built up to a certain point and then the next step is they can move to strength training\nRight and it's and again they they will they will do their strength training until they're completely tolerance there's no symptoms they don't have any ... current symptoms and then they can start with some some non contact football related activities\nThe meeting throwing the football running plays without contact right and then once once they've completely you know ... and their their tolerating that there's no other symptoms now they will be ...\nReturn to the team physician team physician we'll do another assessment they'll do another narrow cognitive assessment to see and if everything is one hundred percent clear back baseline they have zero symptoms and they tolerate it all the previous steps\nThey can be cleared back to play but before they go back to play in the NFL now they see an independent narrow consultants or neurologist or neurosurgeon now sees you in addition to the team physician who probably knows you better than anybody 'cause they spend a lot of time with you\nNow you're going to be cleared by a narrow specially you have to be cleared by both of these specials independently or you won't play\nAs there been any one that has been restricted as a result of that again I don't know if anybody's ongoing that's that's a good question I tried to\nFind that I don't know if they're putting that information out or not they should be but I think I figure every time they were being news because I think it would be you choose people would be upset you know your fantasy players people and you're you're a you're a league and that'll\nThat might be reasons why they're not advertising and I don't know I I it it may be just that everybody's making it through the protocols and moving on and nobody's held back\nBut here's the problem if you regardless of you saying if you've had multiple concussions and here's where the ... you shouldn't yeah period you know and that that's not something that has happened in the past\nRight I mean in the past you know you had your bell wrong you're going to go back and play yeah you know that most has passions they still played you know and that's why we see what we did you know these poor guys who were you know\nYou know and that's why we see what we did you know these poor guys who were you know they they they had depression ongoing depression and maybe even send psychotic overlays just from the ... the the repeated impact\nIt becomes a question of ethics after a certain period of time because if we know there's information and we let people go back out there and someone gets themselves kill with ... like a seven and a cousin\nThat's bad enough and if you're going out and willing to say oh I'm I'm willing to give my life for football that's probably a ... especially if you can ... stuff to make that decision I\nI have to agree with you but the problem is that you know getting these players that's their life you know they want to get back and and we have to recognize that it because then we have to work with that instantly working with players I don't work with the pros as much\nI work with a lot of college people I see a lot of the high school kid they want to get back to play and they will tell me anything and that's why there's neuro psych nurse cognitive testing is so important but I don't know most of these kids I don't have based fines on them and they can tell me nope I'm fine and I'm ready to play\nAnd I don't have any good objective information that's that goes along with that show that seats he was negative the cat's games negative maybe I didn't MRI maybe the neurologist saw him you know but but I don't have anything to compare to based on I think that's\nKey I think today we should be screening everybody at risk for they've had any type play\nAnd and have a base line that I think so key for every player\n[noise] and they think we're starting to see that a little more in college but I don't think the money's being spent I think individualized per player yeah you know in in in the end I I\nI had a party and see a plan um and and it's\nPart of it will let me let me tell you that that they require that student athlete they they give them all the information they need about a concussion symptoms you know what to look for 'em and then they have to sign a waiver that says that they're responsible for reporting injury and I think that's fine I think you should put\nSome of the burden on the player because most of the time they will deny it but a lot of times they don't remember it so you can't put it on the holy ... there has to be more than one screening for that right\nI think the pros should be held responsible to get it they don't want to tell the truth but I think I think everybody involved should be responsible including the coach all the coaches another week\nComponent of this is the state of health care and the United states right now are we are in didn't do cost with these kinds of screenings especially the expense of scams and so that could be another aspect of not wanting to get into it not wanting to cause a problem because of your potential severe injuries you know my problem\nWith that is that if you're practicing medicine based on the economics of medicine you're gonna miss a lot of very serious thing under still only way that you can't you can't look at that yeah you cannot do that I mean you know you don't want to join necessary test absolutely do\nAnd we don't want to do a multitude of scans because that extra radiation so yes we want to you know do we need but we should be doing them and making sure you know don't we uh for me it's never a cost consideration\nEvaluated plan outlining follow it All right we got to take a break\nHere on live ... in the afternoon

more likely to be a hall of famer Andrew Luck a Russell Wilson which would have gotten some form remember we used to do that all the time I don't remember that oh van for years when I was a biggie yeah and fans would call and\nIt was a great question back then but I think we can't do it now these Russell Wilson has a leg up with the super bowl win okay show who could I gave you more likely to make the hall of fame Andrew Luck I wrote Jared golf I don't even know his life even have a chance at the ... is his hall of fame career he's twenty nine ... under his belt\nAnd she still had it on that trajectory\nNo yeah no I don't think so because as teams on any good\nThey can but yeah they they have had a good draft I mean if his team gets a little better he's only twenty nine eight or nine and ten more years yeah but\nYou gotta he's gotta have a couple of Super Bowl parents has because his numbers aren't going to be great he's got to have a you know Phillip Rivers doesn't have a great postseason resume but he's going to have big numbers when it's all said and done\nA I think that's the difference if you don't make the super bowl do you have big numbers to back it up and Andrew Luck has neither and probably won't get either you know the injuries you're saying yeah gambling\nWhat does look at the injury hall pass but the mid part of his career and he pulls like a Kurt Warner man from thirty to thirty five member Steve Young didn't start until he was thirty Andrew Luck is twenty nine he only has a twenty thousand yards Andrew Luck you know what if he goes on a a run with and it pays off of the super bowl\nHe'll get credit for the injury\nBecause we feel bad for him was not his fault he stumped for a few\nYears ... ... ... and I wouldn't look at him as a whole fame
