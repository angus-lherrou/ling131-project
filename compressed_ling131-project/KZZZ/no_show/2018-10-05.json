I really do and people talk about that now the scouts talk about that a coach's talk about that with Patrick more homes like there's an ability that you have to get to that level\nBut what do you do when you get to that level with that talent and can you develop it further and that's an understanding the game you have to anticipate what are they doing and then how to counteract that that's the great chess game that all of these guys have\nOr at least you hope that the marquee guys had that in common the old guys have an edge in the crucial area of the game show celebrate Brady and breeze and remember\nThey're not doing achieving incredible things in his game it wasn't long ago when we looked at Andrew Luck and we said you know one can't mess hall of famer\nSteve Young the hall of fame quarterback of the forty niners said yesterday\nHe would go to Stanford games just to watch Andrew Luck throw football so in the bay area Steve would go just to watch because he said it was a thing of beauty which I find remarkable\nThat you have somebody that pedigree who is going to watch Andrew Luck in college throw football\nWe thought that he was desperate and maybe still is I don't know what he was destined for now but it could be trouble or more trouble two hundred and forty five passage him so he's averaging forty nine pass attempt that's the most all time through the first five games but season\nHe's a one hundred Twenty one attempt\nAims of the season he's a one hundred Twenty one attempts over the last two weeks and actually it's not even two weeks and it's two games and that is what five days\nThat's the second most ever to two games spam behind only Philip Rivers who did it with a hundred and twenty three attempts and twenty Fifteen [noise]\nOut of the day to day for us to do that [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's um [noise] that what data\nNow is he throwing it far or is he just throwing it often because there's a difference there I think that they're limiting Andrew Luck in how far he's throwing a he throwing in a lot but you watch the colds last night and I know they're all banged up but if you don't have chi why Hilton like what are you really have their\nNeed jak oils out which are running game I Know they tried to improve the offensive line with Clinton Nelson by all accounts he's a really talented often she'd Wyman but this is how Andrew Luck got in trouble got hurt and the first place by throwing the ball behind a battle offensive one\nThis is a team that I was told was only in for a lady on bill\nIf they could get way beyond bell because they need a running back desperately you go back to Trent Richardson bay thought that they had to steal from the Cleveland Browns and as it turned out they were stolen from by the Cleveland Browns\nBut you have a situation here that's not going to get better anytime soon even if these players come back because it's not a good team\nBut Andrew Luck with two hundred and forty five pounds of temp so averaging forty nine per game\nThe most all time through the first five games of the season but you start to wonder what else can you do I guess if you limit how far he's throwing okay because there's a timing cadence to this so he doesn't get hit\nBut if you're going back to pass that many times how many times are you going to be get hit\nI don't know how many times he's been hit make love and I don't know pro football focus could give you those numbers or steps Inc but with Andrew Luck\nYeah it's just a matter of time it feels like before we're back to where we were in each injured again and I hate seeing it but it almost feels like it's inevitable\nBut uh last night it was a Tom Brady in the patriots Josh Gordon with a touchdown reception as the patriots hold off the colds thirty eight twenty four Tom Brady had a visit to say after the game\nThings like that Moscow and so forth it's there's so many people that contribute I just think of all the people that\nQuarterback and thrown to himself in these people to catch them and block and defensive plays and coaches the coach and these are all great team or so\nPretty cool he doesn't throw it to themselves but remember when she was ... said that after the super bowl last time he can throw it in ... so he was right I mean you can throw it in catch it but you're not allowed to do that that's illegal a bill Bela ... ah\nI Love the answer he would have been a whole lot better if he would have said somebody other than his quarterback here's a here's coach\nFor the touchdown passes to a lot of different sort of so\nNo quarterback I'd rather have found very is is gross so we've got a weaker euro\nAll situations is for a job yeah [noise]\nIt's just an bill Donald jak would pick Tom Brady

his helmet Sony Michel last night\nA cream hunt in the previous week or are they going to enforce this\n[laughter]\nYour answer [laughter]\nWell you you know it is I think for a running back is the hardest thing to um\nTo kinda get out of your game because the natural reaction for running back as as we get ready to embrace contact is is to lower your head and because ... that's what we've been taught and so I think maybe there is a grace period for running backs that they're giving us\nBut ah yeah yeah I think eventually they will um they will start calling those calls but right now I think is so difficult to take a play you know light or ... or ... it's hard to take the play away and throwing the flack\nYou have a you saw these guys that you know this guy who Sony Michel hit got knocked
