that will give us the capability to go to Mars\nUh and if they should um you\nKnow ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must be ... next to the edge of the ice I'm there and got\nA blue origin company by a lead by Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so ah we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions Senate space astronomy missions uh ... their work in that field is ethic but ah the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is in that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster if NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program I mean that storm cabin in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago or a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem [laughter]\nWhat what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you've got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who do that we went to the moon jumping for joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's this thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they called us the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill and I'd pass on their hats in the end this thing is that I buy the ... and you probably sell me what\nYou buy the swamp lend you probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land then with this well\nYou know with measles doing what he's doing fell in ... it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching national just kinda and not do much anymore with manned space flights in just a poignant Robert really is\nIt is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon ah and\nThe highway system and that government got us to the moon\nAh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects and and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping Bryan it's fine would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flights of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and\nHalf the people who are looking into the guys that night uh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech you alert to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nDramatic it's dramatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compared to um what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone\nA it was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people thought were helpless uh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott large in but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the\nUs space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at fusion parents all this has just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but\nPeople than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem [noise]\nAnd um I gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one\nLunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours ... because the\nBoys on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android rose or to go to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nAn unusual guy um do you watch him uh\nYeah although we can be a difficult at times I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise] uh okay look\nUm the thing to know about Iran is is is okay on the one side he well he is very driven is very hardworking uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do\nGreat for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's\nIs he likes money he likes cool things you can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh now he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for\nDoing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal glory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish\nHe he um and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people are and you know if you look at some of the things about him back to um didn't come off so well why keep getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescue those kids in Thailand\nUm\nThat that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is um\n\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great\nThe eagle ... it's not exactly ego it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the we had this is what homers\nHeroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh uh when he gets in that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must cause a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person I'm\nA ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who\nGoes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you come from the ... results Robert Well Jeff Bezos is much calmer I'm much more laid back um\nI don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect the at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday\nAnd um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model if his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise]\nUm well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space access to the hair um blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know beat shows is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so\nI mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also want a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military base is doing it all with his own money okay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nOr the quicker you just do something the cheaper it costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no\nUh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no it costs much less uh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March march what what's going on with some of the latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European but all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm somebody is not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar than his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nAh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment\nUm it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found and I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north and the northern hemisphere of Mars which find ways to same latitude to San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers\nSan Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get at it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's\n... there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars\nUm them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past\nWell if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur\nSome of America's brave was four years of

Obama was\nA how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report and you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and that's because people wanted what they want a strong America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my state\nWhen they voted for

high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but the point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your

mean about various issues\nThough I think it's been usually resident and you know people just have to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape\nSaying that she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nThat belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's essentially what our staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter it really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life in this state and it's going to go represents\nA Josh or when you look at the makeup of the Democratic party to name the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks\nIs that on people's minds of president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just wanting to calm down in government to work for them\nYou know I think that's ... you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offering it's\nYou know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offering it\nAt home and weakness abroad and this this law behavior is it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think that folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenity is I mean this is not\nThe United states of America or this was not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but to try and shut down speech and harassed intimidating even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder\nOut they're encouraging it Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed that is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of a conservative\nReligious voters have is the social\nTransformation of the country and the the idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate these things in public schools and\nAnd obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nYou know it was ... leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion to churches to individual you know this is something we're supposed to look through my career I've only been in politics for two years\nYou've been going on now you know a lot of girls out there\nYeah yeah I've spent most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nAnd as a religious liberty lawyer and the you know the people said they are a fair minded people\nOr the you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value face and we believe that the importance of value of family and community and those things built around faith in churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think to have the again the left wing agenda\nWhich has become so hostile\nTo people of faith a so hostile to religious liberty just like it's hostile through our Second Amendment rights just like a become hospital the free speech I mean think about it what what the the left wing it doesn't really offered to\nYou know you agree with us or you shut up and that is just not what the people of ice they want I don't let the people in this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you of many many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right deans on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell

don't want to talk about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for them they not speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask questions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\nWho do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foot hold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when when one is the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to the rest of Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part because in the process of stopping if we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed\nAnd frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session how do we

hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being

a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history and our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to get a to get a better

show up so it's in the Senate and the is finally going to agree to move forward to change us otherwise we'll have a caravan every week\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on their we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rules\nClaim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can\nRefugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare and on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come here to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ... and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emit into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the lower ... shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republicans in in a\nMid term cycle cycle normally so what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming at all scared by the media you know all the all him being carried away with all the Trump drainage meant center of\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing paste over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see is I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant manager says\nThey said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert or work programs and our welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because\nThis is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because\nStyron Soros than others have really\nFunneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans care about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho ah was living in the United states he was a it was he he was\nPreviously a kind of a sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and not to radicalize media have been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more instance of things that they do that or not good for America\nThere's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand ... says in Pakistan supported by them the ... network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went through in the process funded by Saudi Arabia and\nSaudi Arabia and ... and Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation but there there's a growing faction of uh those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis I'm not so sure that the Saudis are lesser evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be the hopping mad about\nThis but what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world well the\nThem in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said\nYou know they're and they're important partners of ours though\nIn the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assistant American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ... Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and therefore the ... is that is being sent an export around the world so uh as far as arms they by sort of are I'm sure but I don't think the arms are military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nAre armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that we\nCould get jobs by selling you have six team to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it was about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis actually puts it I said at greater risk\nIt increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nI Know a gym here who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the show the Japanese had to\nFind that very surprising that some of the miles away can be sort of us in his mom's way no access information on intelligence and this is going to\nFall has not seen since she speaks on the notions of the nation\nTickets that\nAllowed to excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial\nSo he says oh we shouldn't presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven what about the three thousand people in your country that you get locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too so I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence\nAnd say oh you need to presume the crown prince to innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince being involved\nThe Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are henchmen there travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment now has been being fired\nTo chop ups or to the chopping up and that just remember him and other journalists\nAnd you get fired my guess is they're uh they're banished from it will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talk to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and this so no I'm not too excited to be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...

five\nAh they're freaking out in the Democratic party doesn't Latino voters you heard from a Enrique who is on the other big rally last night Houston He said there are a lot of Hispanics like him who are illegal immigrants to the United states who are totally pro Trump and they're turning out for Ted Cruz and others\nAre they are not liking this massive humanity crushing at our southern border they don't\nWant it they don't think it's fair to legal immigrants and uh they're speaking out uh I think this is excellent news for Republicans because it shows you that Trump's policies are working in the resonating with people are RC pi has a piece out Latino voters still up\nFor grabs in the mid term Democrats are worried they don't get the Latino turnout that they want their toes same thing with African American voters if Republicans can get African American voters to take them take a second look to reconsider their their\nOld views about what Republicans are like and what they believe in what they want\nFor them and think about how the country's improving and the opportunities that they have today that they didn't have maybe two years earlier really start thinking about it and I think they're going to see a greater African American mid term turnout for Republicans\nThis cycle than we've seen probably ever that's my view but we'll see I mean if it's risky to predict stuff Sarah Carter is going to join us uh she's been down in Guatemala\nAnd she's been doing your own investigation as to what's going on what motivated this a mob of humanity and we'll bring you the latest on what the administration is planning to do policy wise to deter this don't go away [noise]\n\nIf you suffer from Dee Dee and you see your doctor about the little blue bill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nVery well connected with what's happening on the ground here and what I did have an opportunity to do with with meat and speak with all the people that were cutting through mostly young men are a lot of Thirteen I saw as well as just a village hurts farmers\nAre able bodied working men who joined it this group in Honduras as it made its way through and what I can tell you is that absolutely\nInformation that I was getting on the ground based on what they were carrying their backpacks and everything the very well coordinated they had a coordinated message a very\nVery very few of them veered off that message because there was leadership within the group you know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I Do because\nYou know you will catch people in the light OK move this way don't talk to the reporters right now we're moving forward chat this say that and I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but demand up ahead is actually telling you guys you know so I'm assuming you're a leader\nOh no no no no we don't have any leader we don't have any leaders I go up and talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward\nI said well you guys have matching backpacks you had\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked that tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some watching\nThat people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or that they heard it did you uh that they were coming to America to look for jobs this is about poverty so very well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In like Doris\nUh remember there's and you know a lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically but\nA lot about this or there's a big battle here in a politically between the various ah conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here have been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S\nA elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\nOne thing that I I find to be very disturbing are the ah are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation for children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks\nOf these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to coach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan ah they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out on their way or if something is done to stop and soon we'll be well they're not\nA Sarah a group of thousands every week\nComing into our into our borders border area\nAbs yeah ... absolutely Lauren this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nUh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part of these caravans of big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media\nAre in danger are in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what a mall and officials apparently a child a baby I'm\nWith trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to\nTo try to gather information to find out what's going on here who is coordinating this they talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was not down to the ground\nA the baby was buried apparently asked by some of the leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government we didn't have any access to the body\nOf one of the reasons uh the government wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward and\nFor the United states and our us southern border and this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nAre not just regular farm workers are people for villages are that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used by these coordinators but there are some as Thirteen gang members there's some pretty bad guys and these groups to\nUm we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people\nSo we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use\nBy these organizers by these governments\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people are\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ball yeah ...\nThere's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will to all of Eric ... going to let us into a their country and they coached them my coach them on credible fear\nCredible here this is what you say when you get to the border this is how you say in America\nAnd it's just a just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you released to the piece of paper and a judge judge Reinhold women and children separately you can't keep it keep them under the twenty days and then\nThey're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional Saturday get\nThey'll feel like a debt of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that his ear retrieval for Republicans in irreversible\nBecause of the sheer numbers\nYet a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some\nYeah a great point I mean which is the reason we've seen some of the reports coming out of California and other parts of the country where we've seen that illegal have voted right\nUh and and there's a ship and there's a ship and if they become citizens of course there was another shift a one of the interesting things I spoke with a somebody for an immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is\nIs that for example men will take young girls you know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border and if the you know as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother\nSo that they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date\nSo we're seeing the catch and release it still on going oh we have men who have little girls they know they can't put them in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they kept separate them so they released them so we're still seeing the same problem that we've seen for years happening right now and\nThe president you know President Trump is it very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders work in a pool aid or the ... the complexity here is that okay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do\nFor the United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hunter in government that's working against some of the socialist or\nA aspects of their uh their country at political uh apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any with money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating the separate than we really need to start pulling the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people may as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from\nFrom USAID a groups that are that are actually assisting and that's a carrot and and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along that track because believe me\nYoung women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of a red us care of this walk put on the back of card so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nI'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose doing this and what's going on\nHow well again ... follow the money\n... to fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the\nUh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't move this ... this number of people without an organization behind you cannot it just now I don't care what people like if it would be the equivalent to walking from Boston to San Francisco\n[noise]\nKids will spend twenty minutes listening to songs like this\nHow about two minutes to brush their teeth are rushing for two minutes now and see your child from severe to paint later for fun to minute videos to watch while brushing the two men do ask dot org two minutes twice today they have the time a message from the partnership for helping out of the lives than the council\nRight now Doctors Without borders medical teams are operating in some of the most remote and dangerous corners of the world one front yards become front lines at the crossroads of conflict an epidemic where there are no hospitals that where we are\nYour response is critical to our response in places where a few others will go\nThat we operate\nLearn more Doctors Without borders dot org\nAnd Patrick's weekdays Gigi Gigi\nThe fact that we're only on the air Fifteen hours a week of well maybe that guy ... three hours [noise]\n\nTo the dance friction\nTo Chris Weber Turner's forge NBA analyst how would you sum up the Lakers first week or for a couple of games that are going out on the person can make the playoffs there was no you know shooting zone behind\nEverybody was in the Bronx [noise] anything go have to make a choice\nSam ...

they had the big names shake ... junior and the remnants of Eli Manning they just can't seem to win football games\nAnd I think you come away still puzzled as to why and you start with the line I guess that there has been played well but there's plenty of blame to go around the often should one who struggled deep and she was not what it used to be certainly back to twenty sixteen and then you have a new head coach ...\nIs played calling you suspect sometimes teams are fascinated when things don't work out I thought the giants were going to be good this year I thought they could win ten ten games this year\nThey had a formula you had to eat ally and they miscalculated\nThey went all in the defense is going to be better than what it was the ... was going to be shored up by that off into line made shoulder they brought in from New England you draft shake one Barkley the giants thought they were ready to win now and as we see that division there in is up for grabs\nThe imagine if the giants actually played in according to what you would think but their talent level they might be the class of the division right now\nThey're interesting they're interesting to see how this all plays out\nOr they bad enough to get a topic I think bad enough to land the best quarterback in the draft\nOr are they entering in that long run of mediocrity in either way a lot of fans in the NFL probably pay more attention than they should do a team that one in six\nThey got one more primetime game and that's a Monday Night game in three weeks that'd be a kitten San Francisco that might look good at the start of the season a Jimmy ... and the niners and maybe they're playing for a playoff berth than the giants all that talent and ...\nYeah and it's not going to work out but\nKnow you're watching the giants and and it just feels like ... if you think of Eli Manning the one play that stands out in his entire career this signature plenty of Eli Manning is what\nHe scrambled to keep all play alive in the super bowl any threw the ball up for grabs David ... caught up with his helmet so he like that might be a last scramble buddies hat\nAnd it's one of the most iconic plays in NFL history and then um school of course they scored a touchdown with ... to beat the patriots\nNow when he lies under dress he goes down I guess not even they're not even very yet and he just goes down\nBut\nYou got sacred Barkley I Can't given the ball fourteen times might do commit to him he's gonna be a home run he's a very Sanders kind of running back\nAnd he's not very Sanders but he's a very Sanders running back he's not a power back it's weird to watch him and I know he can bench press in dead lift in squad you know it can ... stadium well it doesn't feel like he runs that way and very Sanders was built that way too\nHuge dies but he was in you know he's\nThat way too huge thighs\nBut he was in you know he's the guy who maneuvers he would make you ms sacred Barkley\nI got to get him out in space and let him make plays but he's gonna frustrate you with mine is too plus one plus three you know forty eight yards and that's the feeling you get ... back and sterling shepherd played well last night so you do have the ingredients there\nBut this is where\nI Would call Jacksonville just to say hey I Know I hear you're struggling at the quarterbacking position you interested in Eli Manning\nPlane kick the tires at least if you're Jacksonville and I don't know the lie is any better in Jacksonville because he doesn't have the weapons in Jacksonville I think he'd be even more exposed\nBut if I'm Jacksonville and you've got the eagles coming up in London and Blake borders on his short leash with Cody Kessler warming up in the bullpen here I'd probably make a call to John Gurdon feels like everybody's on ... or you know for sale out there\nWhich leads me to the Dallas Cowboys in a panic mode trader first round pick for morning Cooper\nNow give John rooting creditor Reggie McKenzie or whoever wants to credit out there made a great deal\nBecause I don't want to pay more in Cooper that kinda money first round pick and it goes back to should the cowboys have taken Calvin Ridley the wide receiver out of Alabama get him on a rookie contract now you do draft a linebacker because Shawn league injury prone I get it\nAnd banned her ashes played well but you need a wide receiver and before the season started I said the one gene that means\nThere's Brian is Dallas because they don't handle number one wide receiver and even though does Brian is not a great receiver anymore they haven't filled that void so now you make that trade\nAnd I think this trade says a lot about a couple of things I think it says a lot about jak Prescott because I think the cowboys want to find out if we do surround him with a little more talent is he or franchised quarterback\nBecause I think there has to be some doubt right now\nEverything went well line great ... great uh I had hall of fame tied in a ... Jason ... you know it it all fit together\nAnd then all of a sudden you wake up and you go who are these guys that I'm throwing too and I think that the Dallas Cowboys have to be looking at long you know bigger picture here are you going to go all in ... so you get a more Cooper who was what the third best receiver on the raiders\nFormer all pro wide receiver and you give up a first round pick Jerry's been down this road before\nCan't keep up first round pick up\nAnd what do you get you're going to have a mark Cooper for one more year ... then he gets really expensive you don't want that\nThat's the way and I know there weren't great receivers in the draft but if you get one and you can have that rookie contract then I'm not worried about paying somebody you know Fifteen to twenty million dollars a year because mark Cooper is not worth it\nBut Jerry Jones series desperate desperate though I had a\nCouple of years ago and you're desperate going to get a winner going to get a Super Bowl get back to the super bowl and that was a desperate move there and you know I don't care what John ... says this is no front office tanking here\nThe junk and say oh we're not tanking well I Know the product to put out there they play hard that's what coaches always sick but when you're dumping good players nice tank\nCocked his late ... and that's on the southern Mexico border Senate Judiciary committee Chuck Grassley and Senator Mike Lee are urging the administration\nTo make an agreement with Mexico that would stop the migrants they see a third party agreement with acquired I was asking for asylum to do so in their first country other rival most of the caravan of come from Honduras and other Central American countries in already in Mexico\nPresident Trump blame one asking to taking in Saudi Arabia after the kingdom admitted it involving in the death of journalist ...\nHas a very strong ideas both both ways uh I've been told by certain centers we want that investment to keep coming at the same time that doesn't mean that that they're not going to do something that has to be some kind of retribution after the\nCalled the Saudis account of what happened to the show gave one of the worst cover up in the history of cover up I'll secretary palm pay us as the administration is revoking the visas of some Saudi officials implicated in ...\nBaron County Wisconsin chair Chris Fitzgerald says some items are found during a search for clues into the disappearance of a Thirteen year old girl whose parents were killed but they don't seem to be linked to the case came it costs has been missing for over a week and this is Fox News [noise]\nMissing for over a week and this is Fox News [noise]\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has right Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked us highest in the nation for mortgage servicing Richfield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nThey can rock and words date in comparison to public records racial upheaval only balance or eight thirty or her just turned ... information and conditions equal housing Leonard licensing office he paid animal after thirty thirty additional conditions of\nThe way home\nReaders outcomes Rader an issue to try to change the way things are moving [noise]\n[noise]\nI think we got a full question here loving to have that for your coming on Saturday as well kind of busy guess less Reggie all the wishes Miller Adam Sandler\nThe Oklahoma quarterback Kyle or marine age seven seven three D. P. show I was looking at a more Cooper's numbers and this is where you go what happened here he's one of four wide receivers in the last Thirty years to make the pro bowl\nIn each of his first two seasons the other receivers Randy Moss aging green ... Bek um junior the third and I'm Ari Cooper\nGood group to be in but he's been trending down a he was receiving orange per game his rookie year sixty seven yards\nA than Seventy two nights pro bowl both of those then it was forty eight now forty six and he's become the third best wide receiver for the raiders and now going to Dallas\nI just don't know if that's the receiver that's going to make jak Prescott take the next step here\nIt feels a little more desperate\nI if I'm a cowboy fan I'm looking at this going okay but you gave up first round draft pick and then you might go well how high is going to be between ten and twenty but the pay you have to pay more a coup or if you're going to keep them so you're going to get him for one year\nAnd then are you going to bring him back\nIn michelob and what kind of numbers will a mark Cooper be demanding like fifty million guaranteed yeah but the guy is what they're saying so you can't do that\nIf you're Dallas you can't\nWhat if you get that first two years I'm Ari then can you pay fifty maybe the Oakland off heads on\nI mean down which is often she's not lighting up so I I I don't know if you're walking into a situation where you go man that off inches wide open and you put him in sound like you're going to Kansas City solve it split it that way or what's your question may club\nOkay we are a lot of options we can start with a New York giants we've done this before this literally two weeks ago what's the problem in New York he lie align\nPatch armor when I say that I think there I'll tell you who won the poll last time he lie ran away with it but it's his scapegoat\nWell he's also culpable here there there's part of this where you go in the play calling leaves a lot\nTo be desired sometimes um he gets he got sacked four times I Believe last night um you know can you call a this was basically what has to happen I'm going to throw it six yards to oh back from junior and hope that he takes Seventy or shepherd\nForsake one Barclay three step drop or put him in shotgun and then just say I get it out quickly that that would be my logic here if if I'm approaching it from that perspective a much be logical what can my quarterback do\nWhy is it that he why manning has less mobility than Tom Brady\nApple it wasn't even the most mobile manning in the building last night and I was there doing better\nIn our she was there are she'd be more model yeah she\nHad often seems to be having a real hard time communicating with each other because there was there was this a string of plays and maybe like three or four in a row where he lived through to a spot\nMissed the throat and then complain to there was one to the tight end another neighbor relievers yeah and he's just like what are you doing and you can see 'em like Jeff during with his hands like cut this way not that way and whatever and there's there's probably three plays in a row that they that happened to one drive\nI was also bad beat too if you can blur and you're thinking okay\nToo if you can blur and you're thinking okay I Am the falcons are giving for I feel pretty good good touched down to point conversion bad beat\nWhy is that we don't go into football games when you gamble the way we do when you go to Vegas so when you go to Vegas you go to a casino what do you say hey I got a thousand dollars to lose you don't go into a football game going you know I got five hundred to lose\nAnd it's still the same thing I could play blackjack for three hours and I'm Still entertained couple of drinks and I'm expecting to lose house always wins\nWell house wins a lot in football too but you don't go into a football game going hey got five hundred I got to being on the giants here are being on the falcons
