a business\nWhat it what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was a [noise] an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer\nMarketing officers in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there ... and at a shark him as their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the ... the industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media\nAnd and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why are you know how they think how they buy and Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room smaller in your lobbies bigger\nNow what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it yeah it is\nBecause if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market ... you know it it for about Twenty years they couldn't make their products fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off is was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said I'm ... so you're\nYou're ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he set an Eighteen to thirty four year old man and woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he's over ... they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nThere was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight and he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know your your last gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales one from eight billion get this George eight billion to\nTwo and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from it came from people help people and you will understand\nWell isn't it simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after a bench ally and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people are mine down from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\nJudge you too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic and common sense is not so common volunteer said that you know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and they say that's the boomers\nEverybody you see that the boomers all sat down and I'll say okay if you were born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large groups that sounded ... and I said that's Jenn ... about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials are born Nineteen eighty or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here\nAnd it makes me crazy\nWell ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening to like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing genius suddenly sledding\nYeah I Know you're not you're going to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off you know they're all their increases are coming from um their\nOverseas operations [noise] I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now for team to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you you ought to three ends of of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition and no it's it's for French\nFries darn listen to what they're trying to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food [noise]\nThe exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food or in in the supermarket and if you want to sell food interests\nIt in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trench or are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that\nUh in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation of called Generation Z and Generation Z started in two thousand fired and they will they will be\nA but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise] but\nIn Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier\nBut what's happened since two thousand seven is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next outward Iran coast to coast am\nGet Daily

incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely if there's if it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it it has to a large degree um\nThe [noise]\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a a large number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people I consume a specific product the\nLarge number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce head of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat batch that simple isn't it\nWell it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and the smokers people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal\nJust based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um yeah I'm a guilt companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing department said it kept on firing their their chief marketing officers\nBecause they couldn't come up with the secret to\nSelling as many SUVs to this other group\nBut nobody bothered to count them and the other group of generation X amount of the five and make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said papa you know kids are age you know what she calls herself for Cuba but she's young woman now uh we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it it's funny because I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today uh the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know Democrats\nAre born outside of wedlock they're they're born outside of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture [noise] uh where Seventy five percent of the kids are bought outside\nOf the the uh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that though\nOrange now\nIf you could understand that so whether it's a you know we're talking a lot of our business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to ... forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies but the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I asked folks and my audience what happened to the\nTo a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the the boomer hippies live became Republicans [laughter]\n[laughter] in all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now of thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThere were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five or sixty four [noise]\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nA superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... where there was you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between of generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing a cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age and and um and\nA middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle aged small and then your middle income as small as well but it's a demographic issue it was just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nAnd let me ask you this to me look let's use Facebook as an example you know what I mean they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to becoming a change there where I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for ... year or you were converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that\nA Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way\nTo a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet and and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up if you're a sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's\nA relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but the trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that\nIt is involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust\n'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that ...\nFacebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis puts people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who would pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky jobs you know the idiot that killed the loving people in the Jewish synagogue the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs\nThey use social media to kind of ... their hatred um how come we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert ... in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know

their focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist will gas because Japan had tight immigration but they also believe in the

language all those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and the supplies other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nA and includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the left has to grab

left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this was the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country\nAnd why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the ... they want they want to kind of take those issues away and I neutralized Trump on the campaign trail and probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told not to mention it right by all the ... there's an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\nCaving on these issues and just saying that well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why start out there that cynical they know they have not offered her a platform on any issues and immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and so yeah you're right that the kids were loading up with Twenty one trillion in debt\nAnd then catch and release you know these are all children have got to cross the border right like the Catholics are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted and all are there any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill right so you run those basic issues by the\nThe tax payer and by the kids and say you're paying off the debt you know we're putting all of this on your credit card\nOr the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know ... or leaving their jobs because they're that confident and go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so are the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know it it it it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody\nBut there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offer a result\nThey want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted investigations they want to page the president and peach cabin all my

answer these questions and why she hiding I Would keep paying that where is she why she hiding\nRight right what if it thinks she's hiding came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her hide but she worked at a a Saudi\nA school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is a U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel anti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThere was a bar right what hobbies fundamentalists Saudi training school that produced terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she still proud that she worked there but like you said if you're proud of the fact that you worked at this school that is they hate school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she's hiding or policy platform she's hiding her position on\nHealthcare immigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the ... district in Virginia\nI Want to play a ...

[noise]\nI think again the media really miss apprehend where the American people are on this I think most Americans are probably shocked to hear that illegal aliens living in the United states\nHave a child and that child becomes an automatic citizen I think most people they don't focus on these issues are off doing other things Trump all of a sudden brings it up or like watch\nAnd then you go to U. K. doesn't allow it to Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it Canada does allow it\nIt's other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows this bingo automatic citizenship\nAnd Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I think it's just as a matter of common sense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the left claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate it's a fascinating subject\nJoining us now Mark Krikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura a Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up a yesterday and\nThe media that there have loving response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog whistle dog whistle\nOnce again\nWell I mean us to expect and quite frankly but uh the president is I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting\nIt caused within the fourteenth amendment in such a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists\nOr foreign students from illegal aliens that phrase a it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means\nSo it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue it's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a ruling one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists um our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever's\nAnd start it is for the president to do this issue an executive order and what it means is that\nThe state department won't issue passports for instance for kids born to Chinese burst tourists good woman who um and then somebody will sue ratio you will find one of them they'll sue nobody lawsuit that's this is\nUm you know whatever you think about this Fisher literally whatever you think the policy should be\nThis is the smart way to ... the issue so we can move it along in the process of\nYou know public debate because all we're doing now saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight met acts and somebody says no all this other senator and Eighteen sixty eight men why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's sucking us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless\nOf what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the prison\nI completely agree we have to get the thing resolved I mean that's the Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians and Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business Justin Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid with a passport and your golden yeah your goal that\nIt has as a kid has a passport you can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reason they're people from Korea and turkey who do this\nAs a way of um helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have as all it's a retirement plan\nFor some people because you know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid is an adult and has a job and it's working if ah you know you want you can sponsor you for immigration so that when you're finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this\nNone of which is in the interest of the United states\nUh it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for Immigration Studies will take a break we're going to highlight one of the key congressional races or that is a winnable seat in New Jersey stay

keep the corruption machine gun I guess in New Jersey just keep that keep the liberal liberal party rule going\nYeah that's their plan certainly I mean anytime you support bumping into for reelection boy that says a lot about where you want to take the country and and what you think of congressional ethics\nTell us what happened ah yeah I Know you and your family or have been targeted because simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\n[noise] yeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn signs stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed with a a a letter suggesting that ah my seven children would be lucky if I were to win and uh it was you know disturbing a law enforcement fantastic uh they're on the case of making the kids feel really really safe and secure\nAnd my wife and I look at it shows you what do we do about it but we're going to make sure the kids are safe and then a way to push back it was just not going to be intimidated by some ... trucks things in the mail than hot so we're going to keep pushing forward and the only way to deal with it just push back and set up for yourself so that's what we're doing\nThe district in which you're running a the eleventh is a tough district Trump won it by one percent\nOf the media and the left the resistance are geared up their jacked up to try to uh run the tables and congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers aren't ...\nOpposite ends optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up at ... and you know who's jacked up the taxpayers begin screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it and the state has gotten more and more on affordable with every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here jacket up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or measures let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their taxes just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction withdrawn and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then the blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and its support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both um lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduate and back in two thousand ah went to that now that it's an it's an okay schools Harvard law school but not as good as

is too important\nTo not get involved Johanna and I decided that uh we we're not going to sit on the sidelines\nOr in a year's critical is this a come November six come next Tuesday we're not going to watch the returns come in and not know that we didn't do everything we possibly could for our country to expand opportunity and continue to grow this economy keep us safe\nAbroad and in reform those immigration policies you've been talking about so uh we were we went all in because the country's worth it in ... people have been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and that's what we're going to do\nA when you look at the national debate and uh [noise] you know the Democrats have funneled millions and millions of dollars into voter outreach registration getting people to the polls\nHave you gotten the assistance that you need a from Republicans and the RMC and others to do the same for the Republican side\nThey are and see the end our Sisi the White House they've all been supportive of the president has\nEndorsed be in a fundraiser for me vice president Pence has helped me twice a Speaker Ryan has been in to do a rally\nYou're always a would welcome more help 'em but they've been helpful they they know the seat is important and frankly they're spread pretty thin this year so um we get it we're fighting hard and uh we're in a north Jersey district that as winnable\nAnd we plan on a delivering a major upset to one of the Democrat's hand picked\nCandidates this year uh they're dumping a lot of money and against us but uh it's a good district in good people around here who know a which way they want to take the country that is lower taxes as\nWell and this yeah this is your

Columbia is is having a huge problem trying to bring in a Venezuelan same language\nOr many of the same traditions but still different people a and different traditions and there's a lot of resentment being built up in Columbia friends of mine there's like a teaching profession everything construction same kind of problems stay there\nYou guys heard me talk about a product for months that has changed my sleeping habits for ever it's called my pillow\nGuys I used to wake up with a sore head I often have one of those critics in my neck you know it's like you can't turn your head one way and your neck hurts forget about it I don't have any more I didn't believe that my pillow was going to be so great until I tried it and guess what I tried it and\nWell the fact of the matter is Mexico has confirmed Mexican official speaking to me last week confirmed that there were a Honduran left\nWing politicians one of them was removed from the caravan along with a couple of other associates a who is an opposition leader was actually working in concert with Venezuelan\nA bullet politicians and getting help and comfort from groups within the United states who also have been aiding uh these masses of people as well so there's a\nComplicated Web of facilitators behind the scenes a who's who put the word out that it's as long as you get into this group Katie you'll\nBe protected because there's strengthened numbers\nBeing a part of a caravan does not give these special rights\nI'm but our message is simple at our message is clear we will not allow a large group an authorized migrants to enter the U.S and unsafe for unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say break immigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala data employed violent and dangerous tactics that you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week that\nWe will ensure that our men and women on the front lines of protect and defend it and the president has done so and calling up the military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you I'm prepared already a and homeland security with the\nChance that the president was referencing yesterday that you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does as they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens throughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now are forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit\nWords out Laura I mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase and family and apprehensions and the last five years\nWhere I record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you went to the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before\nWe're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way\nA male adults coming with children than ever before we're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space and tell Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrence to immediately upper hand and repatriate which ... which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a that's a pretty decent percentage well record\nLow a male um of adults apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one at the last time we were the slow in terms of adult apprehension\nYou know so that you're able to deliver a consequence know migration pattern changed when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty\nYou know illegal aliens they they know they know are you a lot better than members of Congress to\nUh this is Terry McAuliffe costs are good front of the Clintons former governor of Virginia on speaking about the uh the use I mean current governor of Virginia speaking about the use of the military what was\nGoing to a thousand miles away their goal is three miles an hour as a several weeks and by the time to get her and here's the point he did as the show today to deploy the army ... what a disgrace\nThis man has no politicized the military and his use or military for political purposes is while I was in the Marines today I can tell you is ... children who were wearing the quality of our country to protect their vote for\nPresident should not politicize\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours and I get Katie uh you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border that that is politicizing the military\nYou know all I can say is this president didn't create this caravan this caravan you\nKnow took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group as president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended and that's what he's done\nIn the homeland security department people you know think about in a border control and\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement ice as part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of ... absolutely\nSo we got the left wants to abolish ice on despite all the great work ice does with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work and deporting a dangerous people from the United states um but I think people don't really quite\nComprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration their victims or economic victims there the effect on public schools affecting our health care system how closely is homeland security working with other agencies\nOn the effects on American society of math illegal immigration\nThe secretaries just in Yuma, Arizona last week with both wrong to tell the acting ice director and Kevin ... and the head of customs and border protection to meet with local sheriffs local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units\nThat they see at the border you know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nAnd I think people forget that every time you you see the illegal immigrants dropped off at bus depots or even flown around you know the the when you know the kids are kids are coming on accompanied their place where they quote sponsor sponsors sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants that costs money\nIt doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say someone has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied alien children in a church has custody right now they cost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually wow\nJust that just people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars\nEach illegal immigrant in the United states annually to the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it cost for me to go to college\nOh my gosh this was Brock Obama just a few days ago on the uh mid term trail referencing this issue of the caravan and the president's concern about it once was\nRefugees ...\n[noise]\nFear mongering Katie\nLast year we apprehend at Seventeen thousand criminal aliens at the border three thousand special interest aliens we know that there are criminals and the flow and the caravan that heading north border security and queasy ability to move as we apprehend and give us the right to defend our borders it's that simple\nKatie Waldman spokesperson for U.S Department of homeland security Katie thanks so much we'll check back with the sound will take a break

Eric meant Jeannie Romeo Cornell and Schumer is back with the ranks of the head coaches with the giants but\nIt's obvious the organizations problems run deeper than the head coach he might start with the owner there and now the browns have an exciting on quarterbacking Baker Mayfield it does feel like they're building something there and there's a chance to reverse decades of futility if you get the right coach in there\nBut if you're the right coach do you want to go in there with maybe the wrong owner\nYou got a good gee I'm a proven GM and John ... and you're all in on Baker may feel and it's something that I talked about yesterday I talked about it a few times on the program it's the development of a young quarterback a lot of it is based on\nWho is your coach ... coordinator how study is that relationship and then off into line and skilled positions there's a lot of ingredients that go into being a great quarterback yeah have to have some kind of relationship there you have to have somebody who is often should minded\nI use Jared golf is deposed poster boy he was going to be a bust under Jeff Fischer will just Fisher is not an often she'd minded coach Sean McVeigh comes in and all of a sudden Jared golf nobody said anything about him being a bust\nIt's that quick it's that simple\nSimple it's maybe not the right word because you still have to find that guy\nAnd finding that guy for Cleveland who wants to go into that situation\nEven though I got a steady GM I Believe a guy who has a true but a proven track record I'm not convinced that that owner knows what he's doing\nNow if you can get him to stay out of the mix then you've got a chance here but you do have some pieces here and I do think there's been momentum with the Cleveland Browns but what do you do next\nWe'll find out eight seven seven three D.

their separation he uses his body and he's still a big guy out there but\nIt just felt like he was laboring there and the patriots really miss Sony Michel which is strange to say because you don't think of the patriots as they were depending on ... a run dependent team which Sony Michel when you have core Darryl Patterson in there\nYou know just different 'cause he looked like a wide receiver kick return or playing running back he did not look comfortable there but without soon even show a little bit different there I've said all along and uh had a friend gave me a heads up just to say
