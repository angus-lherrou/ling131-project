sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity\nJuno very emotional apology doesn't matter they began ... according to Wall Street journal should going or that\nHer ... her stars light at NBC is Jimmy now again\nTo the ... to some of the the the comparisons I think the inevitable comparison with the Roseanne\nBarr situation you've got Roseanne Barr one tweet your route fire you've got Megan Kelly one Ninety second conversation she's fine both of course you had to do with rich\nBut in both cases it seems to me that it's impossible to believe that it was that one\nStatement or comment or act they could get these two superstars fired from the two of the major networks in America\nCould it be that race is just the third rail you can't touch rage that all in any way shape or form and you can be politically incorrect on the subject of race and if\nAre you're out or could it be that Roseanne Barr\nThere\nCould be that race is just the third rail and you can't touch race at all in any way shape or form and you can't be politically incorrect on the subject of race and if you are you're out\nOr could it be that Roseanne Barr was a Trump supporter but making Kelly came over from Fox News and had some\nConservative views on policing on race and other things could be that she wasn't the right kind of person\nTo be in the NBC world now ABC justify Roseanne that's their their candy store NBC gets to fire Megan Kelly is it there can be sure Megan Kelly is a rich woman Roseanne so ritual it's not it's not a matter of of the of trying to preserve their finances\nBut isn't it an interesting thing that this happens in a climate where politically we are back and forth at each other's throats and people on CNN and MSNBC can call the president Hitler they could call Republicans Nazis\nThey can call us all kinds of awful things regularly and that's all right\nIf if the if the raft comes from the left there's no problem with that if it's somebody who supports Donald Trump or somebody who made her bones at and got her chops in broadcasting at a place like Fox News\nNow you're gone doesn't matter how many times you apologize\nAnd it fascinates me that there are some issues for which apologies don't matter race must be one of them when it comes to ABC NBC CBS\nWhatever you know there could be I mean Megan Kelly as the back story goes which I don't watch I've never seen her ... I've never once she and her show\nI I I've known making over the years that on her show a lot and in fact I've been written about a lot in the history of of the Megan Kelly show a lot of people said I helped catapult her to stardom it's a bitch bizarre how it happened\nChris Wallace and I from Fox News were joking around one day about maternity leave Megan was off I was a ... do a lot of appearances on Vegas show years ago on Fox News\nAnd I made a joke is I often joked with Chris Wallace about maternity leave and what a racket\nThat is for ladies and old vegans offer fourteen weeks or whatever Boyd men don't get maternity leave it was just a couple of guys joking around and came back she came back from maternity leave the day she had she came back she had me on as a guest to talk about some political ...\nAnd then she surprised me contrary to what she wrote in her book by the way that I I knew that she was going to ask me about it 'cause I did not but that's okay it was all in good fun and she blasted me a for talking about maternity leave and then that guy that went viral and a lot of people\nView that and if the narrative became look at how Megan Kelly stands up to a conservative big mouth like Mike Gallagher she's tough she scrappy and every time they wrote about it from Vanity Fair on there I was always\nIn there with that time that she yelled at me about maternity leave again it was really kind of in good fun\nAnd I was shocked when she wrote in her book and it's just a minor point but she called me a good guy in her book and she said that\nIt it it it was a reflection of how what a good person I Am that I knew she was going to ask me about it on air and I came on the show anyway\nWell I guess I'm not that good a person because I wasn't briefed at all or prep that she was going to ask me it was I was blindsided by it which is fine I I mean that's I get blindsided every time I go to a caller's that's okay\nI thought that was a little bit interesting I don't know to this day if she really thought I was told or if she\nWas deceptive in and talking about that story\nBut in any event I've always liked her and she's always been nice to me and ah you know I Wish your well\nIt's just a very interesting dynamic that again that third rail seems to be in America race it's got to be about if you if you make a mistake on race it as a capital\nAnd I find that pretty interesting [noise]\nWhere the relief factor dot com studios in Chicago land the big am five sixty the answer aventura Morrow the freedom some it over the west in in ...
