Saudi Arabia thing is a mess but we don't know anything for sure um because we don't have the evidence now maybe the United states has the evidence the president has the evidence I don't know it's all coming from turkey\nAnd turkey is motivated to destroy Saudi Arabia possibly to destroy the west if you want to look at that they're looking to build a caliphate but they also may be playing another game to get closer\nTo the United states yeah I mean there's an argument to be made a they've releases a pastor recently and they want to\nMaybe send the signal hey these guys you're dealing with in Saudi Arabia their their ... should be dealing with us from orange sauce arms you should be working with us more closely and they're trying to integrate themselves to the United states at at the expense more specifically at the expense of Saudi Arabia or because they they don't like the closeness of that relationship\nOr there's an argument to be made there I mean I think a lot of this is\nYou have to take when you have to countries that really disagree with each other and don't like each other you have to take the reports coming out of turkey with some level of a grain of SALT I mean you have to we we need more evident than there we there's a ... if there's a tape\nThat at least are we don't need to hear it necessarily publicly\nBut at least our intelligence sources maybe a a high level reporter uh somewhere with some credibility needs to hear them and confirmed that they exist because we've heard a lot of details about what is on the state but we haven't had obviously if I were air to one I Would not release the tape if I had it and they wouldn't release it yet\nI Would let Saudi Arabia play this all out 'cause remember last week it was no this is crazy this conspiracy yeah nuts mhm now it seems that they are a saying yeah those things happen\nSo now let's see Saudi Arabia again we still we that's all sources to when I Do I Do not know 'em out and say I know that there's a rope thing that went wrong or an interrogation that went wrong there are reports through CNN\nThat they're going to say that right but they haven't actually set it and we don't know where that is coming from yet yeah I Will say that there's no there's no need for us to rush\nUh to judgment here and then I Know like people are that bashing Trump because he kind of said oh well it's a\nYou know it it is a guilty until proven innocent well first of all we should get evidence or there's never any everything over international relations with the past Twenty years of age should make sure we have these things right yes there is also it's not an image it's not like okay it's weapons of mass destruction for example to use one that works in this context\nWhere where we could be facing an imminent threat of you know a bomb going off in a place that killed a lot of people that you know we may be able to stop this is ... if this is this is a prosecution of a crime right\nIn our eyes and if if they have actually killed this person\nThey need to be held responsible however we don't need to make that decision tomorrow no we need to make sure that we get it right we need to actually figure out all the dynamics going on just because it is a media feed 'em today does not mean we need to make a decision today are we actually take it seriously look at the facts only a media feed 'em because it involved a reporter\nIt yeah and and and the stories so traumatic as you point out what was it wasn't at first Hitchcock movie yeah rather window right where window I mean it you know it's such a dramatic Hollywood type crazy\nTwenty four ah you know Jack Ryan story that you you wonder I mean it it it's capturing our attention which is ... is okay it's just that we have to make sure we're looking at where the stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make thirty Arabia look bad my guess is\nBecause I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things\nI'm this prince ... I mean get remembered the prince took his own you know family members other princes hostage in a hotel and is likely a stole tons of their wealth including plane and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking their remains out in suitcases\nSo these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in a you know rich Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that's happening with Saudi Arabia is a lot worse than it's happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already and we deal with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and calmed everybody down\nAnd then when everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because that's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not friends of ours they are not friends of ours\nThey are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it we don't need it\nOpen up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it [noise]\nIn trying to identify as Hispanic yeah trying to be more Hispanic and he he crazy\nHe also went so far as back in twenty twelve try he tried to uh joined the Hispanic caucus in the Congress [laughter] you know [laughter]\nShe didn't know he did yeah he tried to get into the Hispanic pocket because some of the El Paso residents his district is Seventy seven percent Hispanic\nSo some of the residents were upset that Sylvester race was no longer going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic ... so he tried but joined it they're like Mm no the nicknames not enough\n[laughter] real we go to the intersection analogy of a Beto or nobody's intersecting him no nobody's intersecting him he is still at the top of the hierarchy in the patriarchy pyramid\nI think one of my favorite parts of the debate last night was when Beto tried to make this case that every decision Ted Cruz makes it's about money so like he supports the second amendment and that's because of the n._r._a. and he supports this call\nAnd it's like you're you've brought in thirty eight million dollars of nations\nWrangler out raising cruised by what for two one five to one and a and of course at Cruz pointed out he's had plenty of special interest money come in and it just coming in through other names that's coming in through a pack the heat quote unquote doesn't control which we all know how that game goes\nI mean the idea that you're going to come out and making ... an argument about how Ted Cruz is about money when the entire story arc of Beto is based on the fact that he can raise money well he's not competitive in this race heat and he has never accomplish anything yeah she is only in the race to run for twenty twenty\nI bet if he loses how has he has he run for ... I don't know but there's still talking about it other than the euro is talking about I mean she is she is that he's there John F. Kennedy ... Democrat hope right now and other may I say the great white hope yeah yeah\nYeah it's a it's been fascinating to watch this um\nAh it's been fascinating to watch this um he also tried to a pin head up against Donald Trump says they have the big rally coming up what is next\nWednesday or Thursday in Houston and by calling him lying dead like like Trump did and he said that's why the president called him lying dead and that's why his nickname stuck because it's true\nWhich is never it's never stuck and if it ever gets stuck it's never been true and what prompted him to say that about a battle was that he had voted for a bill\nThat would raise the price of oil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil which would raise the price about twenty four cents\nParents have gas prices yeah yeah so a federal said that was a\nTrue but he voted against the bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is true that he did he what did they\nCan they can both kind of claim that they have the truth on their side in that particular case um but it was interesting to me because that CNN fact checked Beto on some things that he's been lying about during the campaign one being that his mother is a lifelong\nRepublican loves this life long Republican right now you know because he's so wonderful and use so uniting yeah she's going to vote for him for the first time or the first signs of life that in law on that first of all your mom is going to vote for you while\n[laughter] at water rebel\nLane wow you got your mum right\nAnd then helping out pet because I think see an end even looked into this way you're dead yeah yeah I ... for\nA hardcore Republican named uh Brock Obama in two thousand eight primary Obama yeah yeah\nNow here very very ... [laughter] okay so here's the interesting thing I Love this part of the expos aid from CNN and\nShe can't remember who likes to she voted for twenty six point you remember ten years ago but not to [laughter] we're really you don't know who you voted for you know and for Hillary and just didn't want to say it didn't want to say it\nShe couldn't if she voted for it if she voted for Trump it would work to\nHis advantage yeah\nShe was she was there so I was part of the Trump saying yeah you know she wanted change she ... they would have worked right oh but if you voted that she voted for Obama in a way this lifelong Republican and then she can't remember in sixteen\nThe other interesting aspect into this lifelong Republican has voted in every single Democratic primary in Texas since two thousand\n[laughter] not\nAt all of them have even went so far as donating money to build bombs [laughter] I I I Love\nThe federalist done this to a ...

well in Italy this is the most ... guy and then is what they do it\nThat's the blueprint right okay so here's the story I used to work in Portland, Oregon I worked a channel to there and a beautiful place beautiful state\nBut most DOMA county where Portland is located a is a far left hip replaced and hasn't been that for many many years where they are permissive uh they want the father's left politicians they can get and they have it\nSo now a a guy will or the mayor of the town Rosa police bureau that's what they call it there are basically says I'm not going to force the law not going to do it and that poor woman uh is going to be assaulted verbally and not allowed to walk where she wants and that's okay with me\nMayor Ted Wheeler that's fine and\nI'm going to tell my officers don't

there doing that nobody\nSo this is the problem the problem is that wheeler the problem is that in ... the\nProblem is the people in Portland, Oregon and that's why I wrote killing the ss 'cause I'm saying we better wake up here in America we better wake up and confront evil and ... is evil\nSo I get my soul mate and I think you did and I've got a lot to ask you about on this but let me let me start with this\n[noise] [noise] why do you suppose that there isn't a an uprising a ... in Portland or they are the blind\nTo it for some reason or do they actually supported are they afraid to come out what is the what's the real readership\nIn in ... in Montgomery County so\nIf I were still working on channel two I'd be doing commentary going okay I'm going to be out uh on the banks of the ... wherever\nI'm going to be there at the ten in the morning on a Saturday I Want y'all come out and support what I'm doing okay nobody's going to do that there's nobody in town going to do that with any visibility at all the ... to um unfortunately\nBecause there are many many many good people in Portland in ... county and I have friends there most people are selfish\nAll right they're into their own pursuits they're doing whatever they want to do and you know what this is the New Orleans but I don't really want to spend time on this and then maybe there are a lot like me\nAnd maybe and people hit me or I'm not going to do it it's a selfish thing and it's not just in Portland, Oregon I mean we have to really as as a people\nWe really have to start to rise up and say hey you know what we want to process\nWe want a presumption of innocence we don't want ... on the streets and mass beating people up and telling women that there has been should rotten the grave it we don't want that\nOkay so important when do we have any democratic 'cause it's all Democrats\nA hundred percent got any politicians at the governor of Oregon doing anything about this saying anything about it no no no no ... and that's how far we've come that's how far we've declined\nSo bill I Want to talk to you a little bit more about this and just one thing on and when you say we've got to stand up and fight this I I'd like to hear your opinion on on what exactly that means a but also when we come back I Want to take you to Saudi Arabia\nThings have gotten even more bizarre and now they're now they're saying that the show was alive\nReal Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left want to destroy that nation when in history we outlawed herself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good but the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy them\nAnd then not trade with them the sanction them boycott them all of that and then you turn around and go the unintended consequence\nOf that is that the whole alliance against Iran falls apart and why is empowered eight times as much as they are now\nAnd so rather than\nYeah and and the and the left wing press doesn't care what happened ISIS did have you seen one article from the mainstream media about how the Trump Administration destroyed ISIS\nNo have you seen them wanting to know under Obama ISIS ran wild and killed tens of thousands of innocent people\nFor eight years for eight years Trump gets in there and the first year he wipes them out\nBecause of math is the defense secretary and he didn't do it in a\nVery public way it was all done behind the scenes but you can get those articles you can get those stories are it even try to get them\nAll right so bill here's here's the problem with with Saudi Arabia as I said you're exactly right you know we're in we're in a no win situation in fact I think we're going to lose lose situation here\nStanding with people who we've known forever de de do this kind of thing all the time yeah ah they're bad people we shouldn't have been in bed with the kingdom and Saudi Arabia and the first place but we were and now\nThey're they're I'm a strong ally that is one of the only one that is standing up for Israel at least quietly\nFighting the Muslim Brotherhood and fighting Iran they we have a lot of aligned interest even though I don't want to be in bed with them\nBut now how do you get out if if a get out well but wait a minute\nSaudi Arabia this is different because if there is a tape\nOf this guy being dismembered while he was alive this will set the world on fire it's different\nAnd new sanctions Saudi Arabia in a way that hurts them but doesn't destroy\nThe kingdom match what you have to do so I'm at\nBut look Trump does have the heart for this he doesn't want to cancel the arms deals that are rich America didn't want to do it and the reason that we're we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia anyways because they headed OPEC we needed that oil and the in the sixties or seventies and eighties\nDoesn't own any more but now Silicon Valley takes a lot of their money\nRight so I have I say punish them\nYou know when when it comes out and I believe firmly they did it I don't think there's any doubt that they did at this guy walked into the counseling and assemble Saudi council it and he was butchered or whatever okay they did it and I believe that salt and the guy running the place he ordered it\nRight to the top so when that comes out than Trump asked to say we're going to do this and figure out a way to punish them\nUm but not destroy them that's what has to happen for the good of America\nAnd do you think they'll take that punishment they've said that if we run on you they have to right\nYeah yeah I mean it's just like turkey when a letting the pastor out or the guys are going to let them out while he's out I mean Saudi Arabia can't exist without the United states they\nCan't exist without the United states because Iran will go in there and cause so much trouble yeah that'd be the place will collapse and so they need the United states can say whatever they want to say they need us and they've got to pay a price for this they absolutely have to pay a price for it\nDo you think turkey has the tape or is this last\nI can I possibly know back in the turkey or three times\nAll right ah I don't know what tape they have what channel I watch I don't know anything\nWhat I I I Would think the leading nationally user and it's just been politics at least have some idea ... gas on it I mean I Would think so too long I mean\nIn the Saudi a council it is Saudi Arabian territory the Turks have no access they did go in by the way which is interesting and they say yeah we found some chemical agents of and then somebody paint that something\nBut let's just wait but I don't think anybody listening to us right now I should have any doubt\nThat this guy was just fascinated by the Saudi Government it's amazing how close this is ...\nIt was just fascinated by the side of them it's amazing\nHow close this is to rear window or the Hitchcock movie I mean it's it's really I mean that's you know if the Muslim Brotherhood and try and swords were involved um a bill always good to talk to you that book a killing the ss\nAbsolutely worth to read it applies to today shows real heroes and real real villains that got away for a way with it for quite some time\nYeah and I want to tell everybody I had back on the nose

I'm Sorry the vocational schools they're building it helps make life more colorful yeah that's what they actually said we're just trying to help make life more colorful they've got a million people already\nBehind these gates razor wire fences they are concentration camps that is what they are um and\nYou're scooped up off the street in in China and you're put behind these walls and you're re educated\nUh and uh it's frightening frightening what is happening and the world is not standing up and and more importantly molest this looks up just looked up at CNN\nTrump says he's not to blame if GOP loses but who cares I mean CNN or can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing else important going on in the world\nThey're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump ...\nLike almost the reverse of a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is is incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive\nBut like they just are obsessed with this person yeah I mean it's it's seemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah we all that matters the whole thing about living rent free inside someone else's head I mean it's so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia Trump Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know truly does Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\nThey caught somebody up a live a lie you they portrayed him alive caught\nHim up and put them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get\nTrump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with the\nLike legitimately like a sickness for some of that money ... if not I am CNN but I mean it is it as a network as a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic is really incredible I mean he really does dominates their lives every aspect or at least there's at least they're public life I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time it's like there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just looked at the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of these stories like the Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting 'cause you're gonna be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean real flop here we're talking about when the all time political flops yes she's tried\nThis way try this on for size or a Donald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right and it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life\nThe thing right and it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I don't want to talk about the\nYou know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job\nOkay mhm I'm\nGreg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about nobody's talking about\nBecause the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers are just how much does this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh I got to deal with us again today I got to talk about this again you can get you get older you get into all of a cheat or Indiana yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of them it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington Greg Abbott is here Ted Cruz's in Washington\nBut you know really the epicenter now and with the last\nPresident is the White House and so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think you\nKnow especially if crews and hold on to this race which it seems like he will at the moment or it's going to help a lot of other candidates in really close races there six tossup races right now or Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada\nAll of them are are very tight um you know\nThe fact that the thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a raise in that group is a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money out of candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance but a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of of keeping the Senate\nBut they are we here's what's happening they've made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Ellen y y and Z on Alan\nHuh I Wonder if he doesn't get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right not he's not something like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who'd been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for very long time he's the whole life has basically been politics outside of his early ... I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking\nGuy and he can he can give a good speech yeah I think he's I think it's it's the bronco bomb a syndrome of two thousand for what is this guy done he will he gave a good speech in two thousand four well he should be president what is this guy done well he's been on Allen\nI mean it's it's it's not just that he's good looking I think that there is a part of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look like\nThat you don't like his policies power he was I Am as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez correct I mean they went ... went through them and the debate yes last night\nI should play some of the yeah um yeah go ahead first of all let's start with a hit a better was opening in how you may know\nBeto is a a Hispanic\nNo ... no Hispanic those name is Robert actually ... from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure you knew how Hispanic he was he a last Hispanic than war than Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFor straights let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate Ken's five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching this and participating in one of the most important decisions of our lifetimes on or if ... says is author of an sucking in San Antonio\nHe asked the powerful see how Hispanic he is he can't even stop himself from speaking Spanish he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic groups and that's something I Want you to make sure you understand unlike this old white guy or she\nHave gone through ... Saddam white or who is basically I mean it's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old white guy sending ... a year and a half to two years older than a better mhm\nOr Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my palm ... um anyway so uh this is it was interesting to watch just because you know like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win or anything you know you don't hear from him as often\nAs you did and he's been doing a great journeys his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump randomly like like the stuff he he votes for the stuff he's doing behind\nBut if you like Trump randomly like all the stuff he he votes for\nThe stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme Court I mean the ah the ah the federal\nCourts is remarkable and will change the course of court decisions for very long time yeah he's\nBeen very involved very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know I mean I get the idea that maybe he's a younger and good looking and can speak coherently I can think of the only thing you can as attractive to a lot of neck muscles yeah a lot of that was a very shiny ... as well very China but he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in the only story about that over or of any note if he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire region anyone ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money listen\nSpate of balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business\nOr met the payroll every week balanced the books made sure that we deliver for our clients only one of us has served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget seeing each other not as Republicans and Democrats but at the council members entrusted with a share of responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year\nWe did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one\nTrillion dollars in debt when we're on track to deficit spender the tune of a trillion dollars a year have voted to add two trillion dollars\nAnd those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash for any already wealthy in a country that has ribbon with income inequality unseen simple last gilded age why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nFrom the political action committees who represent the corporate interests that benefitted from the ... that's why do they vote for this why didn't they vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without ... why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses thirty thousand people to gun violence\nEvery year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee\nContributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt Congress has become\nNow I can unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really it's Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nIt's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now you get a lobbying job at some from and make millions without even thinking about it he was ... I mean he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember this is not a not a money issue a for crews\nAre beyond that of course Beto O'Rourke has accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's got that\nLittle uh you know that little line of ... you know I'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible more in but again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand dollar\nDonation to cruise that make some changes opinion what thirty eight million dollars do what does that make you\nI'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you in to a national candidate for another race not this one mhm for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars a in large a\nChunks that just pissed says them off because\nI Want results oh our results I gave you told me that this guy had a chance this guy was going to do it I saw him everywhere and you still got beat and a and a beaten by how much wasn't even close\nWhere's my money where's my money\nAnd I you know I think that's how people would react to that but\nI I Know people on the Democratic side who have given money\nWho are absolutely that they have given given and given and they're like you know I have to tell you you're you're off the deep end with crazy radicals and you're putting up people who do you have to have this guy\nThis guy he didn't win and I I think that there are some\nThat have given a lot of money that are going to be a little test when a when Robert Francis silver or a has to go back on the you know the night shift of walking the walking the beat like all the other cops in his family [noise]\nSo when you get to the corner Smith an orchard you're going to take anyone not going to end when you're going to do is turn to Mars broke up and go to ... happy and I ...

K. triples III I hosted damn how I got the Lord's here in the studio founder of love with a rancher you here to talk to\nBusiness and real estate in the tri state they how you doing today I'm doing well how was your week was feeling pretty good you know I've just been losing a little bit of sleep we were on the air last weekend is nice gentleman called in and less left us with some nightmarish criticism about how we don't cover law flood enough\nWe're going to take care of that today but uh uh in fact I'm a we're going to do were dedicating the show to Frank Frank if you're listening this is today's for you\nUh so I've asked a genie writer who owns a realty group in Nevada in Laughlin or to joined us today you may remember that name she covered ah ah with then Ken Ken I'm brio and her covered for me a couple of weeks ago when I was in law and Honduras\nOr left it to the stats for the week uh those it ate the Arizona stats runs down the numbers are brought to us by ... reverse any port ... and Kelly stolen\nAll right to date or in Bullhead city they've sold nine hundred and fifty one homes or since last week that's a that's a increase of sixteen so they sold sixteen homes in last week for my hobby has um sold three hundred and Ninety One homes to date and since last week they sold for\nFort Mojave one hundred and sixty six\nWhich means that they sold six homes in the last seven days in Kingman\nIs rocking they're up to a eleven hundred and twenty six that means they sold thirty four homes in the last week so they're doing well uh we're going to get to ... to make that special little bit later\nA price wise a bill had city one hundred and Seventy thousand up to a percent from last year Fort Mojave one hundred and Seventy nine up Twenty one percent\nAnd of course are all star is a former or a hobby valley one sixty nine of twenty nine percent from last year\nAnd a team in a hundred and sixty\nThousand dollars and they're up ten percent from last year so that's just as for the week wow yeah not bad and ah you know if you remember last week we did the uh the double because I wasn't here the week before because we were opening Lofton ranch boulevard and by the way I've had so many people are approached me recall mayor text me just say how convenient and\nBeautiful that drive is from the park way down to Ninety five in and and reverse are going up to Ninety five so\nReally pleased with that and uh [noise] uh I can make an announcement I Believe that told me if you're listening to me he promised me that the streetlights will be on this week so I I I came back from Honduras on Sunday night uh actually Monday morning at four thirty in the morning when I got here but uh\nSo I before I went to the hotels I'm ago Dr ... and see what the um [noise]\nWe have a new contributor Jeannie rhyme or oh there's going to support a supply the Laughlin, Nevada steps to us each week said I Wish I could factor for that vote [laughter] you might think about well so um so for Franken the others we will have the stats every week so\nLet's get to those since we've been talking about him for a minute I'm going to give you the staff as of this week but\nWas a very um I think it was the educational\nIt was a very um I think it was the educational educator in her she brought to three years worth of stats instead of just one year so we're going to get to all those but uh as of October fifteenth\nTwo thousand Eighteen that's where we are now drive\nA lawful and has sold one hundred and sixty three homes and their average sales price is one forty nine which seemed a little low to me and Jeannie brought the information to answer that question so uh we're going to go to the historical numbers broken down by year\nA ... [noise] uh in a two thousand Eighteen in single family homes to date\nThey sold Seventy three single family homes in Laughlin\nOr isn't it because they also have a lot of condominiums there's going to get to that number so that they still Seventy three to date\nAnd then all ah and also in a night or two thousand Seventeen to date they had sold Seventy five so pretty ... pretty consistent\nAnd then in two thousand sixteen they had only they'd sold a fifty eight now it's interesting because the average a single family numbers on I'm going to get a little bit more detail here\nAre on single family homes I remember I just gave you that a staff that said the average price was one forty nine yeah the single family average price home and and the town of Laughlin in two thousand and six team was one hundred and Ninety One thousand\nAnd two thousand Seventeen was two hundred and Fifteen and in two thousand Eighteen two hundred and Thirteen so they took a pretty good jump from ... sixteen Seventeen and kind of stayed\nAbout the even for a for a team of the family yeah and then on the ... let me ask you about that we're going to go into the condo information um\nIt looks like ... and and when we get to these numbers it appears that\nThe condo sales and the single family home sales are fairly even mhm do you find that well yeah and I mean it's just the availability of what's out there exactly ... and they have a lot of condos and they're priced well and they uh I I I think they're nice they're they're lovely complex as you know\nYesterday also I had the opportunity to have a chat with the Camp David ... who's the sales manager for deer Horton in Laughlin\nAnd er he used to play quite a bit of information and ah they that's a group that's been tremendously successful in love and ruin talk a little bit though more details about that but let's talk about the condos now keep in mind\nThat we just gave the number of a one hundred and sixty three homes sold\nIn a two thousand Eighteen to this date or and so if you add up the numbers here the the basic eighty five and Seventy three so they're pretty close\nSo here's the condo numbers and we'll go back in a gift Frank some history all the way back to sixteen\nThe average price of the condos in two thousand sixteen was eighty one thousand forty six dollars\nThe price and two thousand Seventeen average was eighty eight ten and the average in two thousand Eighteen is one on one one seven so they've had a pretty much a thirty percent increase over last year to this year\nI Wanna says a personal question what is the differentiation between a condominium and home\n... I'll let you go that one from ... well single family home it's going to be detached fell a little bit more on channel speaking\nA little bit you know you have the land around you so you'll have a yard\nOr a patio home if it's a town home you might have side you\nKnow patio space on which would talk about a little bit more with the are heartened by the contents are going to be stopped and you don't really have much of an outside other than you are patio that you're coming out I saw the condominium as a really great for people who want to lock and go who really don't want that extra\nYard work yard space you know that kind of think they're smaller more comic elope realism might just be apartment\n[laughter] well yes but you want it then that was the\nApartment you you are the apartment or your rent to kind of your own and then there's actually a to go even deeper into your question because I Know you appreciate details yes there's also a difference between town homes yeah and condos okay and you would say well what's the difference\nAnd compared to single family homes and Jeannie gave you a great description single family as detached you have a legal description of your boundaries of your lot white picket fence a white guy and he's actually exactly\nOr the town homes are typically side by side and uh the ... and uh they have a common area um that um that extends around that but the um [noise] but they also have in the in a town home they would have\nLike for instance their own backyard that little area in the condos years inside an apartment building you own a space in the building\nBut ah yeah so if you get a chance and just curious I Would stop you know have used up over there and see candid up the bill Bree ranch and let them you know how to show you\nWhat we're talking about a in just in describing those units they did have single family homes that they sold those out\nThey did right I think that made me have one or you know left by that I think it had one\nBut the thing that jumped out at me if you figure two hundred and fifty lots and two and a half years that's a pretty good level of sales and\nEven the single family homes they ... they were fabulous what they were offering its they're expressed product and what they were offering and I'm not that the our hearts\nWe're offering its they're expressed product and what they were offering and I'm not the DR Horton expert but\nUm I've worked with them long enough for over the years\nUm they just have a wonderful home with a really beautiful amenities the prices are right yeah and um I Know I had quite a few buyers in these over the last few years and people love it they're very happy we'll go to a kitten hills yeah for the call me and I'll take it that\nThey live with my guests shorter her out of a deal [laughter]\nCall Jeanie rhyme or [laughter] realty group in Laughlin, Nevada and she will take you to say you can ditch at the deer Horton project Kent is a great\nGuy there there every day and um they do have a beautiful product it's definitely worth\n... well you can't be number one in the United states for Fifteen Years and not have something that's good that's right um you know you mentioned a minute ago about the taxes and I I've done the research on that so I've got some comments to make on that but do you actually have people say I want to live in Nevada for the fact that they don't have a state income tax\nYes that that their focus on that [noise]\nThe um the ... there was a study out for over all taxing okay so I don't want to burst anybody's bubbles here\nBut uh the the income tax is correct there is no state income tax in Nevada which is attractive to the retirees but property taxes\nGas taxes I mean I Know if I go over there right now and stuff but the Chevron\nWhich I don't know if they've got great deals on drinks and food over there right now so I'm\nAnd I'm\nGoing to have your love affair with circle K o v the fat up well hello I'm a polar pop than\nLike a nine percent of time and and I are Ninety nine was eighty nine plus tax\nEvery day he's got this giant company or the board I mean\nWe're all I'm a I'm a I'm a circle to pay a polar pop kids [laughter] ah but ah\nThe the thing about it is that if you look at the gas crisis Chevron versus going over here circle K. or to maverick for too fast trip a which is our locally owned a gas station companies are you there are sometimes a dollar a gallon cheaper and\nYou're saying here in Arizona Arizona's a dollar a gallon cheaper Seventy five dollar a dollar a gallon cheaper any days a week\nOf your adjusted for referring whichever on the Chevron has a slightly higher costs because of their additives or gasoline even in Arizona but well that's a that's a question for the auto dart it I'm not go from there but I'll\nHave to tell you that here's another example now not picking on California but if you go down to needles California and buy a gallon of gas on the forty Chevron yeah you start it starts at like four Seventy nine for regular I Know that in a in a loft when it's a it's lower than that but\nIf you compare California and drive across to that article this the first ... you're saving two dollars a gallon\nBianco is the second one there's a new waves as before that which is still a little more expensive than again anytime you're coming off of a major interstate highway like that you're going to find expensive gas at\nMark you know I think it comes to not to interrupt on topic but um I find that it comes down to lifestyle yet so when I'm when I'm Talking to people and they start off with a we we want to be in one place or another because of taxes are because we want\nYou know a more property or we want you know a jumbo garage whatever\nUm I really have to sit down with them and ask them what the overall lifestyle is that they're looking for because if they're relocating hair for a second home a retirement home what are some of the other options that may have to do with um medical and and availability for whatever their certain circumstances are\nSo that's a big conversation we important come in style and that's why I see it all come together\nOne of the weirder questions I wanted to ask is a sort of weird do rentals come from in their life cycle is that a thing where a developer will come in and establish I I'm going to do some of maybe less fancier housing that Mr Lourdes over here has very fine place often often rants what\nIs that a thing where a developer will come in to do it or an established resident will say hey let's get a second house and start working with a rental company and have that as an asset that we own and uh work to provide rental rental housing\nSo there's a lot of different options in that I'm a several years ago when uh when the market was just a little bit different a lot of people were hurting and it was a pretty a as a CIA refined yeah it's pretty easy to find some really good prices on homes that were distressed\nUm they were great investments and people bought them and you know they had their plan whether it be five to ten years I think what we're seeing now it's a lot of those properties now have come up for sale\nAnd so that's where we have the shortage if you will on the rental side because people are now selling those investments so that's one way\nBecause people are now selling those investments\nSo that's one way or another way as as obviously people who don't use their home all year\nUm because we had here along the river whichever side you're on we had both the summer and the and the winter to take advantage of people who come here to play and and and stay sort of a ... situation mhm right actually there's a kind of an interesting dynamic happening right now\nBut I don't know if you've heard of Blackstone ... there are a huge hedge fund right now in answer your question there's not many builders are building houses to bake them rentals but there's a new segment of investors that are built you know the this Blackstone company they are buying homes from home builders\nAnd then converting immediately to rentals mhm and they're finding that they're able to get between five and ten percent return which on the stock market game is you know ... that's a good deal if you're consistently at five to six percent a year they're happy\nInflation's do present your best CDO get maybe four\nAnd they're finding that these homes that they buy and then they rent them for three four years and then when they go to sell them they have the return not only the return of the five to six percent on the\nRental then time they rented it and then they go to a bonus summertime when was the other\nAnd then they take that money and then go by another home and do the same thing so that's a new phenomena it's just started to uh happened recently in the last couple of years but there was a big article about that with Blackstone\n... surprising especially with the calls I got on friday about people saying we can't find anything to rent within this range for people who are just going to work and grunt work at the casinos really we don't we got to take a

has a jump shot every play I've ever seen as him with some thunderous dunk why didn't he jumps out when you can dunk from the free throw line I don't know if you're going to be able to\nDo that in the NBA just guessing they might not allow you to do that in the contest they will\nKnow who looked older as a freshman in college Greg own facial he looked like he was forty ... and looks like a a twenty eight year old Karl Malone\nWho else looked really old really young\nTrying to think if their\nOwn was up there oh yeah he had a grey beard and freshman year in college yeah how do they look so ... yeah\nSo old so you're a fascinating thing that has\nBeen trying to think um\nThere are a couple of guys that come to mind it feels like that All right uh Charles Barkley said to join his hall of famer NBA on TNT and uh hey Charles how are you\nI'm good with my brother basketball's back well I mean really good to go\nAnd I wanted to ask you about this uh Nick ... situation Ohio State he decided he was going to shut it down is going to be a top ten pick he's a captain of the football team and said he's going to prepare for the draft what do you make of this\nWell I think it's just as soon as you are I think ah you know you never to think that they're wrong\nIs his decision I don't know the severity of injury or you know I I don't know how much longer he was going to be out but I never to people they make the wrong decision if if they don't want to play you have to make your own just to live with them\nI understand where these kids sit out the bowl games have been meaningless bowl game and if you're going to be a top Fifteen pig top ten pick her first round pick I understand that and even then it's a business decision that he's risking millions or might be risking millions to play the rest of the season\nAlthough it's kinda tough when they used the captain and you decide that you're not going to play anymore\nYeah I agree with that is tough to be a cap too but like I say how much longer was going to be out as you're going to come back for the last two or three games yeah I mean you'd have to take in his uh\nWith three games yeah or like I mean you have to take and it's a very of injury because I thought when he first got hurt and said it was going to be out a week and now he's been out like a month so it's a tough decision as Pressler beyond a cap that I agree with you\nI ah basketball last night Seventy Sixers and ... is this a rivalry Charles\n[noise] well I think ah for the next ... it was a great robbery in the eighties I was privileged to be a part of it and they're gonna have to play each other for the next ten years you know 'cause ... young kids who was a ... and the Celtics\nGot an over abundance a towel out so yeah it's a robbery in Toronto Raptors in that conversation also but they're going to be ethical to each other for the next ten years so I Would consider the robbery\nAnd feels like the Celtics are just the better team and even the Celtic team they didn't have Kyrie for Gordon Hayward beat the Seventy Sixers last year and the plan so I I don't I I think we want to make it a rivalry I don't know if it's a rivalry yeah\nWell I think the kids go listen are said everything about the Sixers are all going to come down to mark you folks but so you know ban is going to do his thing you know Jill Joelle\nIt went out and got will some channels who I think going to really help them\nI'm a big Wilson shallow fan but you've got ... but the key is going to be more careful because he wants to play against ... ah scares me a Kyrie Irving\nOr an interior rosier they got to get better on the perimeter and that's all going to be about more two votes before it can be like\nAre they on the same level with the Celtics\nFeel bad for ... for a variety of reasons but money is every time the Sixers play the Celtics the Sixers are looking adjacent Tatum going ... that's right we we traded to get the number one pick and bypass Jason said\nWell you know let's do give up all folds yet\nBut it said you know it's so funny to us talk and have kids and we we every time we get something right we brag about it and I'm not talking about you that I'm Talking about just overall when I'm watching all these shows you remember two years ago everybody was talking about Jared go down a bust yeah\nNow easily you know maybe we overreacting markup\nPoses played but it's I'm not able don't count last year market opposes played one game this year let's do it given much is\nIt was a long season we got to get a T won more games to go a lot going to happen in the next several months so that the jury is still out on march ... lost to overreact but Tatum is based uh\nYeah yeah did you ever have a moment where you you lost your shot or you got the ... or ... you know you went through some kind of mental period where you couldn't shoot\nNo I didn't but you know do you know remember when I used to be a good golf when I was just kick your ass all the time you did one time you did one because\nYou 'cause you're scared to play 'cause you you know you a coward you won't come back to ... you know then\nThe closest thing I can think about ... golf game like I'm terrified over the ball I got no idea what was going to happen that's the only thing I Can't really compare it to\nA so I I don't want to say he got a hundred per se Europe's
