editor of the nation edges forged dot com it'll stop by as well [noise]\nThe eagles roll the giants thirty for Thirteen it wasn't even that\nClose and the NFL the quarterback get most of the credit and certainly gets most of the blame and it's not always fair but that's the\nReality and certainly the reality for the New York giants they're not playing well as the team and he lied manning is the guy on the dart board right now\nAnd it's true that he's not playing well but they got serious issues and that'll offensive line they thought that they were going to ferment up a little bit and they sold or they got him from the patriots were they were still waiting for Eric flowers to act like a number one draft pick the defenses what really surprised me last last night\nThey looked like they didn't care they were lackadaisical and even Troy Aikman said that oh they'll back him junior gets a lot of attention is well sake one Barclay was spectacular and they're losing effort but ultimately it all comes down to Eli Manning\nThe giants are one in five and unless they fix the glaring weaknesses they're going to end up with a high draft pick and if that happens there's a chance they're going to use that high draft pick on a quarterback\nHe lies thirty seven and an old thirty seven and they'll move on at some point but if they keep losing they could be moving on a lot sooner than the teams and fans said probably expected or hope for the giants are one in five this morning so worst record in football\nThis was the one that's going to get you if you're a giants fan their foreign Eighteen since distorted last season only the Cleveland Browns have been worse [noise]\nThat's the reality and you know what I'd rather have the Cleveland Browns future right now\nGo ahead Paul hit a oh I Need a mess okay [noise]\nStill collecting himself from that ... yeah [noise]\nOh I really\nShould've gave me a heads up there but uh yeah the Cleveland Browns are the only team that have been worse off than the giants that one in five\nYou have to shake one Barclay has been great it really has it he's wonderful to watch 'em I and it's and it does remind me and they interspersed some very Sanders highlights last flight I go back to when Barry played for the lion's they didn't have anything\nThey didn't have a quarterback they had Herman more and they didn't have a good often should want and you would be one yard to yardstick charge thirty yards\nA minus two for yard seven yards twenty eight yard that's how very Sanders would run in these games but you also have sake one Barclay and if you're adding weight to bury Sanders and his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield he's a really talented dangerous player\nBut it this is a this is a league this all about quarterbacking play I I don't care how good your skill position guys are you have to have a quarterback playing in a high level\nMeeting Dallas has maybe the best running back and football but that doesn't matter if jak Prescott doesn't act like a pro bowl quarterback\nAnd Eli Manning didn't have any time last night you know in today's game you know it is a quarterback based league but you have to have a quarterback who's able to extend to play he like as soon as there was a rush maybe it goes down\nAnd that's that you just fold it's like cards and he just collapses is demanding way and I and let me just go down not even trying to extend to play can extend to play and that's a bigger problem here if you have a bad often she'd wind with a quarterback who can't even role was right\nExtend to play than you know the the amount of time he has back there\nReally limited and I don't know if a Mike for oil and pro football talk or being a little snarky here but Carson when supposedly had an average of six seconds to throw last night he lie manning had about six seconds to throw on all of his Paso jams combine\nYeah he was under pressure but you know my Carson once was too and at least in the first half I'm\nLewis reading of the mother ship said what sacred is doing in the running game behind the giants often should want is nothing short of a miracle every time he appears to gain positive yard that might be a little bit of hyperbole but\nYou run right that often should line is really bad on the right side and his Lewis ... says really bad\nThe schedule is not that difficult the next four games not that bad and as I said I get the feeling the giants are going to win you know five games in a row and then we're going to ... where was this before I'm not so sure about that after watching last night because once you get that feeling of were losers\nThen I just don't know how ...\nOf were losers then I just don't know how you rally each week and you see that it's sometimes there's a a Malaysian with teams they just it felt like you know let's just start cashing checks here\nAnd I you know look back on it was gonna there's going to there's a headline on the mother ship that I had a problem with because they talk about him going in and a half time and a few other places as well but it feels like he was disingenuous what they're\nSaying about oh Dale back on that he left with what two seconds to go in the first to have any ... leaves the field early first you know at the end of the first time and then he said look I I we only get ten minutes and I wanted to go in for an IT if that's true\nIn the medical people said that as well you know that hey come in let's get this I. V. um ... you know extremely humid night last night even though it was raining so just to be fair to oh Dale back I mean I Know that he creates headlines\nBut I just thought that that was disingenuous what was being said about him here is a ... talking about this was the head coach of the giants on why Becca left early before or after\nYeah he had a ... an ivy you know he did the hydrated again he went back in the La Crosse some guy bodies kind of the hydrate quicker than others so we just got to keep looking for ways to make sure you stay hydrated\nAll right this is back him on why he left early\nI was proud of and so I was trying to ... because we have some very it was really like five ten minutes [noise]\n[noise] use of coverage for cyclists going there and we will not be able to come into\nTrue oh\nYeah I'm not going to kill him over that if that's the case if if\nIf they're being honest but I'm looking at the headline and it talks about he leaves early before a half the time and then in the first paragraph says he went in to get an ivy well you know be fair to it\nIsn't it a good thing that he went in for an IV to prepare for the second half I'm I'm guessing\nBut there's there's more to this you know you've got a new coach um you know where are you right now without a quarterback you got a talented wide receiver you got talent wide receivers and you've got the potential you know all pro running back here as well it's just the often should wind is just not that good\nPlain and simple just not that good and I do think that defense as much money as they spent their guys when I'm watching ... orange Jenkins in Ely apple you know sometimes when you watch kids play and they just sort of run around and they're cute\nIf you're looking for new affordable way to grow your business called camera and we'll have one of our marketing consultants contact you there's no obligation just an opportunity to see how we can provide you with the type of results we've been delivering to our clients throughout the tri-state area\nFor you the pole cameras nine to eight seven six three\nFifty five eighty six nine to eight seven six three fifty five eighty sings\nLet's grow your business together\n[noise]\nAnyhow my lease ...

they'll match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar no capital catches tried believe it at discovered dot com [noise]\nAlready polls a got a you've got a tough running back trivia question\nYes and it's based off say Kwan Barclay okay stay quiet Barkley is on pace for eleven hundred and sixty rushing yards by point to Europe to carry is on pace for a hundred and seven catches and about a thousand reception\nYards so he's totally yards from scrimmage against his pace is Twenty one sixty three this would have led the NFL last season all players he would have been a including Todd barely a twenty Ninety three okay how many work there are two Ricky running backs all time in NFL history\nThat had two thousand or more rushing and receiving yards in their first year rookie running backs only to one you'll get one is really really tough\nMhm\nWell one's in the eighties the others in the nineties\n\nTwo thousand plus older you argue terminals or\nAir ... air conditioning is the first one twenty two hundred and twelve yards that's most all time that can place had Twenty one thirty\nI Know that the way Paul I say and maybe an edge er and James Andrew and\nJames is correct wow he had Fifteen hundred and fifty three rushing arts third sounds another sixty two catches are five and six his first two years or are as good as just about anybody enter and James hasn't changed by the way has\nTwelve thousand rushing you think he's a hall of famer and he also has four hundred and thirty three receptions yeah and he's been out of the game since oh nine so he's on the ballot he\nGets overshadowed though by the wide receivers and the quarterback with the colds but but edge was and I was a weapon and you know when you plug in fourteen Fifteen hundred yards ...\nI think I haven't started remember how controversial was when they took him over Ricky Williams now are these Ricky Williams was the biggest star in the sport and uh they said he had just more versatile man they were right\nThose are great numbers for say corn Barkley but does it prove that you can have a great running back but you still need a very good quarterback\nAnd you could use a little difference there it's not like if you had you know Sean Watson that's going to cure everything for the giants\nBut you have to have a quarterback who at least can make a play extended play keep a play alive somehow some way and he like can't do that and and and if you do have a battle offensive line it's even more important to have that quarterback who has that ability to keep something alive\nAnd to the giants look back on this and say all you know should have shaken a quarterback well I think you'll you'll say that if shamed Arnold proves to be great or Josh Allen proved to be great or Josh Rosen\nProves to be greater Lamar Jackson proved to be great but they weren't getting Baker main field a bit shake won Barclay has got to play at this level to validate taking him number two overall\nYeah glum\nBut don't you feel a little better though if you're like a giants fan who was like oh we should make it last night I think gives you some hope that at least you got a special special player\nYeah but you you do you have to take a bullet for this she's sure but this is what they geared up for they took say going Barclay because they thought bringing in Nate shoulder maybe
