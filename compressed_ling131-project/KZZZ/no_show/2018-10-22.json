in the last CBS or Hugo poll on this which was in June kind of at the height of the family crossing family separation issue\nOf the workers that were poll by the CBS poll forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact\nOn their community fifty five fifty eight percent of white voters said the same thing sixty seven percent of Republicans sixty one percent of independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters are said they want their congressional candidate to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels\nThat is a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the level should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter of what we allow in legally now\n\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that make them a majority at least fifty percent\nOr they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent\nTo current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally see most people just don't know most people you know in the country doing other things maybe they're not listening to the show they're not they're not on these

credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in ... and you need help coal trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified culture where\nIs your view on us\nYou know are there is a right way and a wrong way to do just about everything and there is a great way to come to this country and there is a long way and say you were going about it the wrong way if they want to see political asylum there is a process for doing that and we know\nThat it is important that we defend our southern border and when you talk to all of our border patrol agent said talk about the necessity\nOf doing that and I think it's in theory if that is we\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure and if they are protecting their sovereignty book cause this is not something that you know people entering by force\nIs not something that we should view as the unacceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nOn the news first you do this you know take no prisoners very partisan way of what you've world deeper burger good at it I just tell people that were while I'm not for God\nGeorge I'm sure you want to move forward racial compromise is try to show for health care home's big issues with one of them would be real pleased represent people see one more time\nOh here's had eight years of Obama what did they do they must have our healthcare system and we did catch and release yeah so what is he talking about\nWell you know just this this is going to be language that you hear from liberals\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most she bipartisan\nRecord of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continued to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace family freedom has an opportunity I'd do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's\nSovereignty and protecting our borders securing the southern border\nOr send my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave Valley State issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one files them illegal aliens he they tend to see a hate crime\nFor illegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but this is the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them\nThose certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need the end of this diversity lottery and I think Silk Road is somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course we have the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so I say life stand firm on this end to what to make certain that the care of and now they cannot just come walking and our country and receiving benefits\nTennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down south West Virginia\nOr illegal immigrants there uh again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash a and this undermines the U S a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration\nCurve of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond fed up with us and how it has to stop a congresswoman Blackburn what what will you\nAs in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally live at about but there's there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall\nWell you're exactly right and of course my locker legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up and that that is a good place to start and to remind people to do that is and executive them a program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting that money on the timetable in developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large realize why does work anybody doubts that go talk to Israel\nWalls work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I'm that would say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is retiring this grandson and ... illegal alien went back to Mexico and\nThis is not it's it's not right and for these families they want to see justice like want to make certain that we do you verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar update a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under bid like those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally and\nYeah and then he and his son\nGo in and do it\nRight but he said you know he meets these big jobs for he and his sons to keep them they simply business in in the or to keep it growing again\nAnd so these are real issues and what I Will tell you this I think when people look to the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the border secured\nEvery child support or to them every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order police has endorsed me and my grandson tough on crime tough on trafficking truck ...\nTough on the drug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue if they see it as an issue that affects them in their community against the law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community show\nWell and again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here\nOn the floor and grim show we hit the issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by a record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in his mid term cycle or that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them\nIncluding on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gaps in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused\nTax cuts take on China get more manufacturing it home and it's working\nWell it is working and I'm not a fan of tariffs I like free and fair trade\nAnd in West Tennessee where I Am right now or our farmers our soybean farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China but here's the thing China has had a trade war on us for decades\nSo ... how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nRight and so what they will say is if we're in a war we got to be sure we win this war and that is what they want to\nWe got to be sure we win this war and it what is what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price that that is tough on China like than scaling our intellectual property take them reverse engineering it's very hot and hooking American Jobs and our phone or will say oh\nWe get it but we've got to have some great leaflets they sure when this trade war and that we open up markets today are encouraged to project us and said why they don't encourage that that you do is structuring their agreement enough to take over the talks now\nAnd they want to see more lateral\nTrade agreements that are going to open more market for Tennessee poor\nGreat work sports team is Eighteen year old guys have a lot on their minds accidentally breaking the law probably isn't one of them\nYes that's exactly what young men will be doing if they fail to register with selective service so you know a guy so I see them a favor remind him fortunately it will only take up a few minutes because that's all it takes that register at ss dot Gov then we can get back to his district but [laughter]\nThat's that's dot Gov register it's below\nFlu season is here the flu shot is the first and best protection against contracting the flu so take a positive step and help reduce your chances of catching the seasonal flu and get a flu shot\nThe cost of a flu shot is often covered by your health plan check with your health insurance than scheduled appointment today by calling your position going to a nearby convenience care clinic or visiting your local pharmacy many employers also offer flu shot clinics in the workplace\nFor more information busy W.

history\nSo let's go macro for a minute\nHunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years

never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the ... of what's often called now they're quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis I've tried to figure out your your role of life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to being a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption\nThat most people know in late adolescence working experience\nThat disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life and that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been

susceptible to being sort of um a spoof or persuaded the things that aren't real are real\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs and ... these ah to sow discord in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme and\nMore right you had to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround someone and give them a fake experience and ... ... fake audio and fake video that are going to seem real to make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad\nAt it the real reason we need to take that Russia type investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team off since\nI'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large\nAnd number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about um gender about guns there are many many issues where Americans are so divided that we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already trying to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL and the controversy majority of the stuff on line on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both sides stands for the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russia on both sides\nAnd so we're gonna have a world where you're going to have things like the cabinet hearings were all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ... or video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear and it'll be Kavanaugh partying hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake\nBut in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write them a why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood that believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n[noise]\n[noise] how come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\nI it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere in a McDonald's right now who probably slap to an old man wearing a mock a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of not pecking and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty thirty things I'm not going even ask you I'm not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this\nUh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites um it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nThanks so they have that good to be with Glenn Beck\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really want it now you're really want to get into him on\nOh you're a conspiracy theorist weight she just said it\nAt one point [laughter] oh I mean first of all the ... you know the press is a collection of individuals some of which do a good job some of which do not ah so it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that\nAnd it's important to make those decisions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding and I know and and it at our founding but we've what we we realize when we were engaged and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what the solution we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm a ... thing and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... ... a reaction from conservatives\n... Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a heap\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hunting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't now I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you\nKnow here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to a fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront eight face to face right and then you can there's nothing on the left there are\nEven prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to ... minute emotional politics that go minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there so here's where\nI think than was wrong when he said to deal with ... um he was right when he said you know it's a small group so small groom she's right\nIt is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nHe said part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know 'cause you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know it was a Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when a bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been I've been traveling there isn't Quebec forever a bunch of KKK members walked through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run\nThey but that's not what we have now we have to a breaking laws you can't ignore the now can they can ignore though I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nAnd I don't think fast would argue nor that right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics\n... getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just Smith a group like as a photo though that's how they grow\nA and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti father and I think that the generalize argument he was going for well the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and the\nSolution is to not do what people did in Florida would Nancy Pelosi\nYou don't do that because that doesn't give you a side to run to yeah\nYou don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's just when you talk to gabbing about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going okay you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this\nThis will grow out of control you just don't do that 'cause there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like Well Nancy Pelosi is doing but I Do I was there doing so\nWho do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because the press treated Kavanaugh\nEverybody kind of hard and their positions didn't they\nEverybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\nThe only the only thing\nOutraged the only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said\nYou know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounding on ... and I'm like okay I don't\nWe can't we can get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengage then it's just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of\nReal thought real actual timed this\nUm and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who\nMade decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow and we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener I'll do it into a very good oh right yeah you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida of an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said victory\nAll on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of the independence just stay out of it because it's\nSo immature and it makes everyone on both sides but fat because they just can't talk to each other mhm anymore it's just at\nOur God now that being shed every one that I Know it's an independent and the state of Florida will be showing up for the conservatives\nNovember really are and why is that\nA simple reason you've got people in the office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more finally I got my first uncommon in eight\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah I mean yeah\n... ... there's there's things like that are going on there and I and I'm a conservative Christian showed you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they forced themselves into a restaurant that can hurt people when they're eating with their family\nOr most depend and they think exactly the way I Do a church so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we hope we used to be an independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way but we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's right is right as far as extras concern I think a lot of people are underestimating that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are a lot then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between\nThe two that if the independents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go and thanks so much Andrew ...\nSo fills your mind is our sponsor

governor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a needs to be introduced to a larger audience how ... what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um obtained ground game I've seen the longtime um if probably ever be have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a van ... affects our calendar\nI'm making sure people show up social media we have a a team on Twitter team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's Youtube video production when\nYou have not and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we've raised almost half a million but to be to be clear if in these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition\nAnd with that I pulled that Thirteen percent so you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen thirty nine percent this is a five way race thirty percent when this thing\nSo I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard part writes a math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down it's the media can I get my name out to enough people\nTo where I cross over that barrier which gets to be all that sort of is I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win yes what I really is as well get\nGet remember at as third party in general the system is stacked against you and some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do I take the hill as a matter\nI get I literally deal with failure every day this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration\nThat's every single day as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS and they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even though thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS and it got him him shelving is his name he there's decided nope Larry shop doesn't deserve the on their he's decided that the establishment is all that matters this is what I'm up against it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably um maybe tweet storm\nWhat's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think that Tim shelled so this is a radio debate yes well they're going to be televised also now okay or are we both televised on radio ... he'll be buff okay so yeah again and\nThey're just deciding no we don't want them they'll me wrong there are three other people should be me should also be the Green Party and also the and party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this with against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this we're still growing and they're still going down that that says that but they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when I was thinking ship mhm or maybe they don't care\nIf people want to donate how they're doing\nLarry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't\nThe maximum asked forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law say if you I Know what I Want to get like forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you're only can get forty four thousand that's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that coming up in a just a second a standby\nRight in it yes it is so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and their pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent in New York state they being spent in Florida we really we literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions though sure pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no\nWay to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises ... who work their whole life and were promised ally\nAll of the promises jak people who work their whole life and were promised ally\nYep what do you do you see it here in Texas with your place for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and we have all the time you're\nIn New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation mhm so patches of critical right now pending or about Fifteen or sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us\nWow yes for about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget\nHow about just massive and it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the of the pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a four to five they know that France it\nSo it's a bad bad bad and they were you at the people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is doing relatively well some of

distances that almost about the equivalent\nOr ...\nAny time you run the car for less than five minutes you don't allow it to get up to operate in temperature to burn off the the residual condensation that gets in there\nAre more than five minutes yeah All right but\nYou know I mean if you live here in town and you do all your business in town not running for very long\nBut depending on how long you're a Ninety five and you need to hit all those stop lights\nUh well\nYeah actually coming from Southern California\nThere isn't any traffic in Bullhead [laughter] and if you think there is go to Las Vegas or LA you'll change your mind real quick I didn't say traffic as it sets up a stop light and ... yeah\nWell it all three of them [laughter]\nAnyway yes you should rent exercise your car if you can monthly it would be just fine and bruises case a ... you know a lake that thing out of every three to six months I mean he he didn't have to do it every month but\nIf he needs a needs bananas and bad once a month wouldn't be a turtle [laughter] and it just gets all adjust a song that gets everybody lubricate it and it it gives the engine a chance to breed properly get rid of some carbon 'cause you're going to be pushing it up\nThat hill and that's going to blow off some of the bad stuff and it's going to work and make it better [noise]\nAll right so back to the story of the bronco and the black smoke and the leaking\nGas yeah well well wait we surveyed it because\nI wanted to make sure it wasn't an engine related issue with the coming out the tailpipe and it was more of a raw gas somewhere or after checking the computer and doing some motor engine essentials\nAnd feel pressure testing we come to find out that it was actually leading fuel on the shop floor\nAnd that was kind of a baffling thing 'cause it's coming right from about the center of the vehicle center yeah\nAnd then we're the gas tank is and that ain't\nWhere the motors at so somewhere in the line or\nYeah this thing has uniquely enough only for eighty nine only [laughter] and a few of the early Broncos and rangers\nOr as an odd black finale plastic\nThing in the middle of the suffering in the middle of the car with the feel pressure line running in it at the top and going through it and onto the another fuel pump forward on the frame and smaller lying on the bottom running from the engine\nBack through it to the tank which is a fuel return line\nHuh and some of these have filters in them it was for his idea of a filter for a short period of time of a one year period ... there was a couple of years that they actually put filters in eighty nine they didn't even put filters in ... was just acting as a result or\nTo keep the high pressure profit for them to frame or else primed okay [laughter]\nThey're very yeah another one of the engineering genius things\nAnyway anyway that same licking and\nFord has disavowed knowledge of any such critter [laughter] obviously\nA after some hunting\nWe did find it I guess we're on ... yeah and that but they're out there and we did some hot and I haven't had a chance to to talk to the customer yet because I don't know what timeframe he has generally we're looking at three to five days to get something ...\nSays that's something that could uh be resolved with a a maybe a new retrofit of a fuel and some other\nOption that might work that uh we could possibly\n... ... it's\nIt's a special connection that's a that's a positive lock release mechanism that it's not just your typical fuel line ... or something like an inverted flare like a break line\nWithin the EU tightening this it's not that simple or that common never as insists this is special city to itself all four of those ... going in and out of this thing ... so there's there are a couple of ways around it your you could remove it\nUm\nBut then you would lose the engineering aspect of having a reserve supply of fuel to prime the pump because it does have it checked out within it to keep the for pumps primed which is a high pressure electric um then they don't like to dry run so there's there's some ins and outs about it\nBut we we determine between fumes and black smoke in this vehicle\nOutside of a redesigning the entire field delivery system\nAnd outside of a redesigning the entire fuel delivery system for this eighty nine bronco you would have to just find all the esoteric parts yes whatever source you can\nAnd yes that's how it works and that ad and it's a it's kind of fun to work on some of his old stuff and it gets to be kind of a\nHair raising and daunting at times to I can imagine a that one isn't as bad as uh we've just finished up a a a complete engine and transmission job we did in a fifty nine holes eighty eight\nNew and it came out real beautiful is pretty part\nAt least when you open the hood is beautiful and hasn't been painted on the outside yet ah one of those ... under the hood\nLooks like it should be painted outside uh this this woman's to rebuild missing a kind of like Johnny Cash show one piece of the time but uh she's getting her\nAll ... all the brakes are done we did those earlier um by six months a year ago\nAnd uh we just uh it was called the ... with the uh completely going through the engine and getting the transmission completely rebuilt\nAs you've decided on the color or however original that's is that a ... color and a white or ... yeah\nI just wanted to imagine with my head yeah it's yeah it's very pretty [laughter] beautiful car\nAnd it's got the guy actually rocket eighty eight\nThree Ninety four roles motor and with a ... is all all factory all\nPower breaks nice car oh yeah came up your ... and we as a game I saw a nice way to ... took pictures through the whole process or going to pull some of them in the office said no we're going to give her small photo album to go with it\nOh that's sweet yeah so we we move along on stuff like that a\nVery well covers our fuel dilemma that people out there will\nTry to paint mind that that to if you smell feel it should be attended to and looked at what you can't figure it out for yourself as its fuel leaking or just\nGenerally you can tell black smoke 'cause I mean if you jump on the Toronto when you look in the mirror and we see a cloud of black behind you or diesel truck instead of a gasoline engine and you know that that that smells probably coming out of the televised\nBut take the opportunity for next time you have one available which shouldn't be long from now when you're filling up your vehicle note the ascent of the gasoline going into Iran and we'll be an spent fuel and or maybe if you're around some cars of acquaintances or or you just see someone parked at a gas station who\nLooks like they might not have taken all of the tender love and care they need for their vehicle uh when they started to see if it has a different sent out of the uh around\nIn a while just slept for smoke if there's black smoke coming out of it try and get ... you don't know if you have to try and get a whiff of that you want to get through the odds are a grey\nSmoke coming out of it try try and get a sense of what that is because that's more than likely engine oil yeah and if there's white smoke like the Vatican coming out of it ah that's more than likely engine coolant either that or have a different smell other than to its own also\nEither that or the car just elected a new pope within itself and what sort of the black clouds for the uh an spent fuel then\nYes All right this black that that's just brought fuel in the system and and gray will\nBe oil oil the body think oil would be black but now when it gets burn it and he likes it likes and nice shade agree\nSo if they're passing out by in front of a an you uh get away from what's coming out of their tail five after you shake your head and just a lament the state of their car the aware of what it smells like just in case you ever come up against or\nShot old cars that just got it running junkyard motor and the guys that go out and race and that that's how that are very small town dirt track thing got started in the old days of the ...

says the first rookie so you know the fact that he didn't play ... he played one game last year doesn't that this isn't like a issue row or you know qualifying his rookie of the year ...\nI don't think so I I Know he set the record for most touchdowns in his first eight games get back to one game last year yeah and what do we put the over under thirty eight in a hand I I think thirty five thirty five\n... ... homes have played no games not one minute last year when he be considered a rookie this year like Ben Simmons was no\nIt doesn't work that way in the NFL [laughter]\nI Wonder why they don't do that but Benjamin\nSet out because of the surgery and then he's still considered a rookie same with baseball there's a certain number of it back so I Believe that you qualify but uh\nWell it only happens with quarterbacks to everyone else can rotate in so weird position like that\nWhere do you where do you have the rookie quarterback now because I think bakers still doing some good things but they can't wait ... you know what they they didn't look good early\nAgainst the bad Tampa defense but he can peach and they had a chance I mean that's all you're asking I mean I Want

man\nGood are you being a former senator I curious about the whole late in the game with the cowboys in their long snapper what did you see on that\nI didn't see anything um I saw center that kind of has his his route normal routine 'em let loose here I think he's been in the league like fourteen years um and look I was a long San Fran too I lost that that high school I lumps in college I was a backup long snapper to Ryan keel\nAh pretty much my whole career in both in Cleveland and and what the giants\nAnd every long snapper has kind of their pre snappy little routine and if you go back in ... and you look at any snap from la to Syria holds the ball with one hand his right hand and he's waiting\nFor the kicker to get set and the kicker give the nod to the holder and then the older looks at the center and then and then now he knows he's ready to go and after holding the boy on his right hand he now put he would adjust it and move his left hand over to a well when he did that the defense Lyman jumped so\nUm I I don't think he did anything wrong I think that the officials saw the jump and then thought that he was baited but it was really a normal movement for him and um you know it was pretty much pretty much a farce from from a Center for prospective\nBut I wondered if this is a case of maybe coach rude and saying prior to the game hey you know one keep an eye on their long snapper because it looks like he tries to be you know the uh the office or the defense of mine\nYeah every ... every special teams coach has a list price you know probably grows as a season goes on but a little little uh you know ... part of the idea see committee that I think I've mentioned before on your show but\nThey go up to the referee then they start you know it's our pleading their case hey keep an eye on so and so he does this keep an eye on this they they like to do this so you know maybe that's something that that one of the coaches alert them to and said hey you know this
