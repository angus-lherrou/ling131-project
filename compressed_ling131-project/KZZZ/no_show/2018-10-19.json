P. show email address sepia damn Patrick dot com got a couple of meat Fridays songs for you coming up a little bit later on as well say good morning to a radio and TV partners\nDirect TV the audience that were killed two thirty nine where you can watch this program if you'd like to see the sausage being made or is Fritz Fritz he likes to say we will show your sausage also a NBC Sports network carries the program on our great radio affiliates around America as sports fans we love a good redemption story\nI'm not sure if Clinton crush on David Price count with a redemption story they both one side young they're two of the highest paid players in the history of their sport but both legacies had a noticeable blemish neither had done well in the postseason\nDuring this year's championship series that seems to be changing her show was great his last outing or you know sometimes you get you you set the bar so high and then when you don't get up there again then people look at you and say you're struggling but I Can't say that about ... his last time out\nUm he gave the Dodgers have three two series lead over the brewers meanwhile price he is outright struggled last night delivered six scoreless innings helping Boston clinch the series over the Astros and this is good because you want to see great players perform at their best when the lights are the brightest and these are\nTwo of baseball's better pitchers left ... and there's a lot of baseball left his fall it may be these two good match up against one another in the fall classic but a Dodgers still have to get by the brewers as a they have their game\nComing up tonight um [noise]\nA couple of things when I thought about the red Sox when you look back on and it's a dynasty because you normally don't have dynasties or use that word in baseball very often but this was over the course of Fifteen Years there's a San Antonio spurs New England patriots type field to what the Red Sox have done\nBut when you look at the spurs Greg ... always had Tim Duncan\nTom Brady and bill ... but the beauty of what the Red Sox have done is\nThree different managers now go to the world series three different GM's go to the world series and they haven't had the common player you know Jeter with the Yankees was the common thread you don't have this mania David or cheese for a while there but you Patti interchangeable part so what the red Sox have done in today's\nParity driven you know baseball world is pretty remarkable\nAnd the fact that we don't have a back to back champ I think this might be Eighteen years now where we haven't had a back to back champ in major league baseball's the Astros bow out so what the red Sox have done with interchangeable parts\nAnd it used to be a dynasty where you'd win four five six in a row now we've changed the definition of bat the patriots are dynasty\nOr the spurs word dynasty and I think in ...\nJust to uh the spurs word dynasty and I think in today's baseball world the red Sox are a dynasty but to do it and go to the world series where their favorites again you know they should be and will be applauded for what they've done of course you've got to win this they're damned Patrick\nShow brought you by express employment professionals say connect great companies would top talent find your next job or your news team member visiting express pros dot com come up with a poll question and I got to stay out of the day or two\nLabs late night last night damn you LeBron go into the Lakers man now I didn't have to keep watching the cardinals Broncos after a couple of picks sixes and then I thought okay let me see if they must or anything there and I realized that Arizona is just I mean that's a really really poor football to\nYou got some talent there but the offensive line isn't good um you know we can question the ... scheme that they have their uh Josh Rosen under fire that's not a hot day by the way that Arizona is a bad football too [noise]\nYeah and that's not a hot day too but that's not what rank anyway and no one is\nSaying that no one is saying that today [noise] now I'm watching and I'm going okay of the bad teams right now who needs a quarterback well Arizona might be the worst team in football they don't need a quarterback with Josh Rosen I like how they were selling this at the beginning of the game where Troy Aikman goes you know I had in my\nSecond best quarterback and I know the Broncos really loved in gene Glazer talking about how you know the Broncos uh everybody thought the Broncos were going to take Josh Rose in and then they did and then the cardinals said we're going to trade off and we're going to get jobs Rosen and then you go out and all of a sudden bang on off somebody's hands of and it's a big six another pick six there\nDavid Johnson nothing I think Larry Fitzgerald's reconsidering\nI think the NFL should have a a rule\nLike one player each year where you just say this is a veterans exception exemption we're going to let you play for somebody like where do you want to play I mean that you know if it's your last year Larry and we want to have you go out as winter\nI don't know if anybody's available here Patrick Peterson yeah Patrick Peterson at twenty eight or were you trade him playing playing well but the cardinals or a mess but just a mess yes the glove\n... are you worried about the long term ramifications for like a Josh Roseanne I think the same thing is true for Josh Alan and buffalo the to Josh is you know is it possible David Carr kind of thing could happen here where they just get hit too much\nI don't know how long this rebuilding process is because that's really hard if you put Josh Rosen with the chiefs Josh Rose is going to put up good numbers but he's gone with the ... he's with the team that doesn't have a good off inch of line and the times they don't even look like they're playing football\nBut when you're ... Thirteen times and for storage and all of a sudden it and it's not always the sax sometimes you just get hit and it's not as he got hit eleven times last night and then all of a sudden you start seeing goes hockey it gets a little muddled\nAnd you know then it starts then it starts to chip away at your confidence level but last night I have some bad bad football [noise]\nUm what kind of ... question you got for me my club\nOkay uh we could start there with that football I hate asking this question but who is the worst team at the end of that I can be some choices\nBased Saudi journalist ... is dead killed during an incident inside the consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nAccording to Saudi Arabia tigers and ... and that's out of the conference which you know that he entered the country that's on a second and according to also says we're going to limit for them and I\nThink I've ever met actually will be charting um court church and then ...\nNews Alex Crawford officials in Riyadh and say Eighteen Saudi nationals have been arrested so far adding that the investigation continues President Trump earlier today commenting on because Yogi investigation\nThat's a very serious problem for them to be very much involved is truly\nWe don't like a very serious stuff [noise]\nSome lawmakers said the U.S should postpone a multibillion dollar military arms deal with the Saudi Government because of ... death\nPresident Trump focusing on a caravan of Central American immigrants heading to the U.S border as he was on a three stage campaigns waiting for GOP candidates several thousand migrants are currently at Mexico's southern border President Trump says the U.S provides millions and the aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador warning that the funding could stop if the group isn't turned around\nDoing nothing for us I call them I said very nicely you're not going to get any money I mean let this at\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is now in Mexico city discussing the immigrants\nIn Oregon I Am\nToo I'm Rowan violation sovereign\nMexico and\nEarlier this week the president threatened to close the country's southern\nThe president threatened to close the country's southern border to hold illegal crossings\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your eight states blocked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win\nCall us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRachel the crew only about on certain three year fixed rate loan scholar crossing permission and conditions equal having like like it's not that he takes animal AS number thirty thirty initial conditions are excluded may play\nThe leaves are falling while shopping for new rake you check your ADD security cameras from your phone and some kids with toilet paper next approaching your property\nThen you see what they see you're Eighteen signing outdoor camera scurry away\nScarecrow service rocky by ADD designing and I'm selling a smart home just for you to act like best in class twenty four seven protection learn more at eighty ... eighty T real protection license information available at Rush Limbaugh Laura Ingraham bad Mike Gallagher\nI was writing number one dog radio network\nOn AM and no one asked them to do something to advise them Ninety four Twenty one\n[noise]\nAge\nSeven seven three D.

everybody's mind what happened last night and you know what you have that coming out party on Thursday Night Football and then use that bat you know the cardinals can be bad and relative obscurity but when you're there Thursday Night Football or you know everybody got to see it or you got to watch it\nFor a little while we want to switch it up to if you are a top camera crew but would you do with the new gi legal\nYeah we can do then we'll start with that topic with Jay bill as he has to be in college basketball ... good morning Jay how are you good morning Dan how are you I'm sure we get to meet friday by the way I didn't know if you're celebrating that where you live but it's a it's a big deal here\nWhile I'm I celebrate everything you celebrate there might be there\nThank you I Am ice celebrating the one hundred and twenty five thousand dollar contract to the elite high school basketball prospects today\n[noise] yeah I I I think it's another option um but I don't think it's a it's a Sara Lee a game changer there's going to be a lot that's going to be said about it ah and I think there is some celebration at the NC double A. office because they can now say\nHey if you don't like you know what we're surveying then go somewhere else you know you can go on to the G League\nOr nobody's forcing you to go to college but then when complex you know when I Want it done rules brought up then they say well we should have anybody forced to go to college that so you can I ask him or work which is a but I I don't I don't think it's a bad thing to have that option I just don't think you can see some exit that said that the ... for a hundred and twenty five thousand\nHow do we decide who's elite for the select contracts with the Julie\nThat's kind of the problem I think it will be the NBA deciding who they want more than anything but but that's an open question in a really good one\nAnd you know you're you're you're having a lot of things converged now after the FBI investigation started right about a year ago or at least was repealed about a year ago with all the charges a you know all of a sudden we had everything turned upside down ... came back with Mark Emmert commission\nThat we had all these recommendations are USA Basketball these camps of shoe companies leads to a record shop will take their money but we don't want them to talk of the players that kind of thing\nUm you know we were having a lot of a lot of barriers being put up right now and I don't really know how it's going to shake out\nBut they are clearly what's clearly happening is they're trying to separate the best players\nSo the the ... really the ... you can continue to blame all their preexisting problems on on a ... it's really remarkable what we've done this week we've said that you know instantly said well people have no interest to go to school by the one that's unreal being forced to go to school and nobody\nReally looks at the other side of it of saying well who's forcing you to take up nobody's forcing you to recruit one and done players if they're not interested school nobody's forcing you to admit them at the school and nobody's forcing you to give them a uniform if they're not doing their homework and not taking the classes you think they should take\nThis as professional not minor league it's major league and the only thing that is not professional about it is the Laker players are treated they they don't they don't have the same economic rights as the as the students they are going to school with who are allowed scholarships and whatever their talents combat\nIn the marketplace that's it's really kind of a bizarre system but the truth is like like what you're saying before the fans don't care they just want their gates you know it's like ... you know they don't care about how much coaches are paid up a tree line but they just want their games when they want their teams\nThey want to watch 'em they want to bet on 'em they want to enjoy 'em and they don't really care like I don't I didn't care whether the officials in the NFL got their pensions a few years ago I just wanted the game\nAnd it's the same thing with with college athletes the fans don't care what they're paid or not they just want the games\nShe traveled Jay we appreciate your time thanks for joining us thank you brother\nI ... you know there's a lot of questions with his knees right I don't know these kids are going to pass up going to do or North Carolina or Kansas or you know fill in the blank to make a hundred and twenty five thousand\nBut if you make one twenty five and ... Williams and making one twenty five and then all of a sudden Adidas to Nike comes in and says now we can pay you ten million dollars\nYou know instead of waiting a year to get sponsor you're going to get money under the table and these guys do a you know there was just sophistication but I think it comes back to the shoe companies and you're finding that out in his trial because\nIf I could have given school throw out X number of million dollars for you to wear our product\nThrow out X number of million dollars for you to wear our product okay [noise]\nUh I Want the best players wearing my product before they go to the NBA and if you're on display playing and big games actually televised games and you're a good team I mean which it it just product placement is what this is and that's what's going on here so do I think it happens everywhere just about\nJust about because there's so much money involved\nIn these coaches have to validate their their salaries are the schools want to make the NC double a tournament\nOf the NC double a wants to have a good product for March Madness the TV executives want to have a good product with March Madness and it all comes down to the bottom
