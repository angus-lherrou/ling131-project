just gone through the most traumatic terrifying experience anyone can have shorter being murdered\nA this is somebody who you know wants to continue or sluggish involvement with this guy a and and we have other examples about a girl who uh\nConspired to evade her friends in order to go have sex with this guy that she'd been making out with um during a dorm party she sent a message saying do you have a condom\nIs on why we have one or let's just pause on this for a second this is an accidental college Southern California\nAnd and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking beer niche and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and it said\nOne of the things she Texas okay you have a condo and he replied yes and she text back\nGood give me two minutes and so you know the inevitable silos and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reasons and now claims that this guy raped or I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is good it was so mad so willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trips with this con demise guy uh she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now\nSo many guys that receives these messages it's going to perfectly\nRationally and accurately assume that he has affirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college she was under enormous pressure from the Obama administration they want it to rack up as many male scouts

the school of that case is yet to be heard but the text message trail is is completely\nA vindicate cement and exonerated sim\nYeah yeah there is none of them you talk about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being as being raped a she checks to the to the boy how on earth where I'm sure the ... to her\nHow do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies your great [laughter] and and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes\nAs I described in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of a false claims and that is hysterical\nCompletely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses\nFirst survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at its magazine\nA forty three percent of the females homes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is they have you with that is completely in on thing couple\nIf you have actually been raped you art that is for the most as I said the most terrifying experience you can come do you feel nothing but repugnant from from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily have sex again and and the the key to this whole whole\nHoax is that the numbers that we have on a ledge campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves the same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine\nWhen the researcher asks that girls whom she classified as rape victims whether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the ... the phony campus rape epidemic a conceit depends on\n... violating one of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female editor word except if she says she hasn't been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has\nYou know how to this is this a couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be raped\nAnd then that they combine that with this with this idea and they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet hearing that any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask whether it matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe\nAnd and as you may know Heather I spent forty years in the courtroom okay and and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes\nWhy you know uh most witnesses or don't lie and almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie but but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man\nAnd for the same reasons and the video allergy that\nSomehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nWell again let's let's let's remember where the city elegy is coming from it is coming from the campus is and it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization it is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of in Denmark racism and sexism that the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is a ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearrange we thought that maybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top that they\nThey're put decision there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's going to get claim top dog victims status\nBut but females you know we started there early on\nAnd and they claimed that they are victims of rate of sexism this is preposterous it is it is preposterous particularly\nExcess of this is preposterous it is it is for postures particularly on college campuses which are open to everybody where females are encouraged\nFrom from the time a girl that's five years old today on where she is the in incessant recipient\nOf messages to six feet you know women and stem girls to code ah encourage ... right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys\nWho are an afterthought corporate barred with the message that they're at the ... they are the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point\nMail to just get a check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them\nUh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is is the valued but as you said the court room you know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truths are finding mechanisms like cross examination\nWas with the understanding\nThat human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very hard to remember things there's implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with this Christine Fort\nWhat her therapist was doing to her ... therapists these days are very left wing who knows you know one\n\nThing happened whatsoever\nYeah it's a ... and I think it was probably an eye opener to a lot of people who haven't been following closely\nThe phenomena that you describe another on college campuses they've got a burst into public view here was the accusations against a judge Kavanaugh a but this is the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if if you've got a child going off to college uh you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself and and the rest of us have to realize\nDon't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating this victim ideology\nOr it's not just about the Democratic party that although the Democratic party has now been overtaken by camp this identity politics that his poison for civil

lord I Want to take calls here to the bottom of the hour let's start with Richard in Texas timeline one Richard lock and look program\nWhere you calling in regard to the uh\nIn Texas on line one Richard lots of luck over\nThere you go in regard to the ... and that has recently taking place and looking at the first amendment of the constitution word says the right of the people\nWanted to stay in the right of the people to peaceably peacefully too simple and petitioned the government for groceries grieving everything that we've witnessed\n... of the attacks on other congressman the threats\nOf what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the attorney general whereas the apartment of justice surely by now there are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up yet it it I saw when I was on the air here where\nSomebody I'm from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid to show up and engaging mob action in Washington in this most recent or go round\nYeah I don't know whether the deal Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing and stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the the chief of police in Seattle and you've got and chief a son who's\nA rioting in your city smashing store fronts you know breaking up a\nPlaces of business are hitting people over the head of baseball bats and um and a two by fours\nAnd and sending cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for for a sessions or the department of Justice Roberts you add them arrest him put him in jail and if you're the the district attorney in Seattle's throw the book at him you know these people deserve law in jail terms\nA big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the\nKind of like the provisional wing of the IRA and back in the old days you know that that the activist wing of the militant wing of the Democratic party they don't want to prosecute them they don't want to put him in jail and uh so I think that's where the that's where the enforcement really needs to be getting his at the state and local level where the crimes are taking place\nLet's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened in two thousand eleven and Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give union members that choice public union members that choice and paying dues do you remember the hundred thousand protesters bus\nFares on ... or the country over the capital was terrible\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital or they threatened a Republican legislators um they came to boxers were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons\nA Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot ah there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about it Governor Scott Walker he was successful the Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate state assembly\nStood strong the governor stood strong and the book is called on intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even the Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin turn red\nThere were set attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuit everything you're saying now uh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin\nI'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt\nIllinois as you know the Democratic legislators ran in here so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight when they ran\nRight they hit out and of course the Tea Party exposed where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel it was just you know you couldn't carry on a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process\nAnd by the way organizing for America the Wisconsin branch was busy there that was Obama's growth two thousand eleven act in a while\nI assure you that you make a great point I mean we we've seen that\nOh wow [noise] anyway\nI assure you may you make a great point I mean we we've seen this show before they previewed it in Wisconsin and the good news is a walk or one and and they made a tremendous progress tremendous reforms in Wisconsin let's go to our Roland in North Carolina line six so welcome to the program\nHey John I don't ... thanks for taking my call I'm sixty eight years old I haven't drank anything thirty some years but when I was in like things\nAnd the ... when I was in the U.S in the navy ... marches where you could possibly drink and you cannot blackout gr ranking American beer\nUnless you were an elfish [laughter]\n... [laughter]\nThat's very ... I you know uh I I've probably drug my share of American beer I guess I'll confirmed what you what you say I think it would be very difficult to uh to black out from drinking beer I don't know maybe it's possible I certainly never a\nServer [laughter] oh let's see let's take one last caller Kevin in Florida I live on five Kevin I'm sure you've only got about thirty seconds quick point\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] I've I've watched the whole Brett Kavanaugh I watch soccer or but it kind of relates to the movie\nSeries called Thirteen were reasons why everything that happened in that series a from the gang rapes to drinking everything and it also happened to a very prominent kid in that are in that series\nAll right who knows you may be right we've got to go to a break we'll be joined by I guess Adam Michelle when we reached her\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny self sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age sponsor can see a definite difference in her skin since using it watcher sunspots age spots and even read inflamed patches of vanished right before your eyes\nAnd in particular the give opportunity to people starting out at the bottom of the totem pole it's really striking I think how successful his policies have been\n... I agree I think it's sort of as an economist I knew that uh that that tax reform was good for the economy that regulations were at work drag on economic growth but uh it's been it's been incredible to see how how transformative some of the these reforms can be it a bit\nOf an reaching the power of businesses to hire people when they need them and to ah to grow their business is how they see fit is a is really a transformative across the board\n[noise] it really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking bases are currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had 'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval and that's the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero not that doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval and actually mine is eleven\nSo Trump said that this moment is eleven points better\nSo we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something or what do you think are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above it both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between\nThe two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan ripped you'll Trump's tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it means but the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax\nCut that that was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future the tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of last take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that's a ...\nIs it that that sort of typical American can expect and that the\nThat that that that should be scared to to most Americans that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the uh with by simply repealing somebody's big pieces of the house and the president ... ... ...\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions and I mean stops to answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the Kavanaugh nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela and he said yeah if the Democrats get their way are all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out as socialist and when you look at what's happened in any\nSocialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela now you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more\nPets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] the the the record of socialism and something like eighty fixing zero it the way it's been tried more times than it should have been at each and every time it's a it's it's crumbled and then left misery and destruction and wait and I mean that's the that\nAt a very high level that those are the two the two direction we can shoot\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money in that rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington letting it sort of lost around blind people pocket and then\nA part of it getting back back out elsewhere that the adage if not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses no how best to spend invest their their resources and and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American or you know under socialism some people always do very very with health so Hugo Chavez and his daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so I if you're part of the ruling click or you're a part of the the socialist in crowd yeah you could do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they can fry 'em up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially toward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs\nThat are Michelle thank you very much for being on the program we appreciate it

number one news talk am FM radio leaders K triple A. M. K. triple Z I'm Dan how it's Monday and that means we've got John the auto dock here in the studio are going to be talking about cars automotive items or we're going to be picking up last week's topic about how\nTo purchase a new or well a new to you ... a used car\nOr some tricks and tips to do that\nBut if you want to call in and asking the automotive questions you might have about your vehicle what's going wrong with the dog is more than happy to diagnose it for you in king when a golden valley nine to eight seven five three twelve thirty\nIn Bullhead city law in court will hobby Mojave valley and needles it's nine to eight seven six three ... and the toll free at one eight four four to one I'm twelve fifty how are you today John\nGood guy now or you know I'm feeling just fine how do you like that thirty degrees less temperature out there it's almost chilly by comparison I call it the Bullhead trap and we will come here this time of year they get trapped by it [laughter] All right so what are we going to have a continuing on from last week\nA well we're going to continue on with the uh uh Ken steps buying a used car\nA ten steps or ah or find out how much you can afford number one number two what's the right car for you which follows what you can afford\n... number three uh find out your cars value so that you know what you're looking for a step forward contacted communicate a with a seller\nStep five uh get both ... safety reports on the car a step six conduct a thorough walking around a step seven conducted throat test drive\nWhich is about where we left off last week and there's three more steps that we're going to cover today a and a little more detail a step fate will be going the extra mile to assure the quality of the car\nA step nine negotiate your best a private party price and and that can negotiate your best dealer retail price will be covering all of that\nLater in the segment we're going to talk about engine oil life monitors I'm sure there are puzzling to everybody out there\nAs with most mechanics I Would believe if you ask them what sets them off most of them are going to look at you with a blank stare a less clear this up for most of the people best we can and then after that time permitting we're going to get into winter ice in your car\nIt's tough to find something that you want just doing it scattershot\nA yeah uh we\nActually have a friend there the shot is selling a ah golly gee I I Believe it's Lincoln a Ninety three it's in than taking care of and it's really good shape everything works on it and that's going pretty cheap I don't remember was two or twenty five\nA ... and then we have a shot truck that we're moving out of it\nIs in Ninety six Toyota pick up that we're moving out of but that's not going to be in the price range or looking at there that's where I was working\nMore for like I'm doing photography I Need something in the back on it and then you need\nA little wrong so yeah yeah I hear ya\nYeah so uh what do you think should I worked for years on her short do at this for a chance I Am\nI that is that your wallet I Can't make that decision for you\nYou like the vehicle and you have a pretty good idea what might be coming down the line\nIf you like the vehicle and you have a pretty good idea what might be coming down the line and how long ... as far as the other items that are tend to get a little wary as a car news that high mileage and do you think it might have a pretty good handle on it you can probably go for it\nYeah I it was a good running car and I'm not going to use it for growing you know won distance anymore just work yeah I was working I was working at all these cars are\nYou're right you're right that if you don't get much for granted and you might get one that drops the belt and thirty days and then you're looking at the same scenario yeah\nYeah so that's right words there could be something that's going on it sounds good but you don't know in this way a guy would be looking at it every day and let me know a little bit anyhow so\nYeah well the very least if you scan through again find something you like get the the ... the preliminary look at it at a shop that you trust and see if maybe it is a better option\nNow can I tell John but I get the fifty percent discount because of you are [laughter]\nYeah well we'll take that off off as a double price we get for calling on the phone [laughter]\n\n... thank you very much\nYou guys do down at all ah arrive where where we [laughter] ah well\nWe were going to make a a extra shirts of quality or we're recommending you contact your lead a local department of motor vehicles\nAsset or for ask what forms are required a to transfer the title as well as any other information you need to to provide for example some states require you\nTo bring the vehicle to the DMV for inspection ah that's no longer the case in Arizona but it used to be a some states require a smog certificate I e\nNod in Mojave county anyway [noise] and other uh others require a below sale from the current owner um I don't believe that's even a political and Arizona but uh I'll take my word for contact envy Dan they'll let you know are finally\nWhatever you do get everything in writing this means if you settle at a private party right up a contract staying you're paying for the vehicle and under what terms it is to be delivered\nA and the same thing with a used car lot and whatever he yeah we'll get into that later when you negotiate with them or the next step is a negotiating your best price from a private party\nOr the art of haggling back kind of [laughter] how when\nBuying from a dealer you may receive unlimited warranty perhaps thirty days\nAnd many dealerships offer manufacturers certified pre on programs for their late model cars that can stand that can extend the warranties out a number of years some advantages of buying from a private party include a lower price\nYou'll have all the repair records if they are available and you know the previous owners should any questions come up later a that certified used car thing\nBe careful of that if you're buying from a new car dealership a\nIn town that's in within locally would be like ... and poured or if in the Chevrolet if they sell you a certified used car you can put some weight behind that certified\nUh but if you're buying it from El keys used car lot or else these help tea stands for less trustworthy [laughter] if you buy from El Kee ah that's certified a program probably doesn't mean anything so don't put any extra money or faith in that\nShow up back the play twenty nine days later is a laundromat ...\nWell that yeah that and they don't know anything and it was in writing\nJust just be careful and even if you get it from a new car dealership make sure it's in writing [noise] but we're on private party cars now so let's keep going most private party cars are not in perfect condition which is why Kelley Blue book private party values are you usually much lower\nThan they used a retail values most of the time that seller and buyer assume the car is as is\nIt means what you see is what she did but there are always exceptions also most sellers added a few hundred dollars to the asking price for\nNegotiating ... unless the seller specifically states the intention of a firm price there should be room for some negotiation and our a thought on negotiation is\n[noise] and if you don't ask you're not going to get it at all\nOh she Asian is [noise] if you don't ask you are not going to get it all\nFair enough so\nThey're not mind readers and even though they were and they thought you wanted to go out to be afraid to ask the worst they can say is ... [laughter] and\nOf course there's a certain level of finesse to take with that too it's like I demanded is much\nLower like no I'm In a way that's not negotiating that that is not ago gee that's not negotiating\nNegotiating is that uh that just say the person who's asking for five thousand dollars\nAnd you put it on your puppy eyes and you say all I've got four thousand\nA now at that point\nHe told you what he wants you've told them what you're going willing to do he might say well I Can't I Can't do that but I can meet you in the middle at forty five now the balls back in your court\nYou asked you saved ten percent and you got five hundred bucks you want the car for forty five or are you willing to walk away from it to be our nose in stand up for the U.S\nAnd it's all a matter of reading the or adding the deal that negotiating\nAnd\nI I used to say no offer was to insane but if you know somebody's asking ten thousand dollars for a car and you are from two thousand [laughter] you're probably not even going to get a response other than the laugh like I got them back on your series about buying a car\nI got two thousand dollars in a bunch of these a five gallon water jogging Wii kept me somewhere in the middle\nAnd assistance so anyway I keep it keep it you know keep it in common sense in in in local value\nSee we have a color hair color Iran with live at local who are you how are you\nHey skirt and vote ... City Hi Kurt how are ya fella us just fine and you\nGod well ah obviously event listings so the gentleman what the uh uh timing valid issue a\nFor what it's worth the devil you know and the deli adult now mhm so where is that year I uh I'm going to step in and I recommend that he has a repair\nOr he's not going to find anything that year Nathan model that he likes ah that he already owns for anywhere near that price and he knows everything else about the vehicle and if he doesn't fix it is not worth sped anyway\nWell that's true it's it's a actually a candidate for this crappy if he doesn't prepare yeah\nYeah so uh uh he's just whatever value it would've added a he has nothing and so he is in effect getting a a motor rebuilt by a and he's back on the road a\nBut on this uh buying a used car or I just went through that or what some people may not know here is that in the state of Arizona if you buy a used car from a private party there is no sales tax that is correct if\nIf you're in California and almost all other states you buy it from a private party when you register where they levy a sales tax on you\nThey they have a A R yeah and they\nSee on registration and other things so if you buy a car and Arizona you're registered and let's say economy foreign yeah\nYou're going to pay him a couple of thousand bucks or whatever or on their eight nine ten twelve percent sales tax we don't do that if you buy it from a dealer then you will pay state income tax\nOh yeah oh right so that's what you want to look at if you're interested in purchasing a new car either from a private seller or a dealership\nOr we're going to move on to what topic now is that what they say oil life monitors than they ever questioned what exactly do they do and how do they do it All right and remember you can call in if you got any questions about the previous topic of this one coming up or anything up with your vehicle\nAnd king when the golden valley nine to eight seven five three twelve thirty Bullhead nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety the toll free one a four four to one night twelve fifty\nThere we go wow we're off on the all life monitor maintenance reminders for oil changes have been around since the early eighties early systems from German and Jackie ... Japanese manufacturers\nLooked at mileage and maybe revolutions of the engine today it is difficult to find a vehicle without a light warning message\nOr ... percent of oil life indicator to get the driver to change your oil my bassist and estimate the life of the oil based on our preset mileage recommendation\nPresident\nPer cent of oil life indicator\nTo get the driver to change your oil mileage bassist and estimate the life of the oil based on our preset mileage recommendation\nThat can range from five to seven ... five thousand uh Seventy five hundred miles that can be an effective reminder for some owners but it is I take into account\nSevere duty operations or a customer or only makes short trips which would shorten that interval and the computer ...\nChannel I don't know some of the newer systems might [noise] calculation face or intelligent oil live monitors used multiple input to determine the health of the ah oil\nGM's first oil life a monitor what they call it all L. A. M. oil life monitor\nTheir use more than just mileage to determine the hon appeared in two thousand seven\nChrysler was not that far behind in two thousand eight\nAnd Ford had an intelligence system on most of the co starring in two thousand eleven systems from GM Ford and Chrysler are based on oil ... intervals on actual data from the vehicle\nAt the heart of the equation is still mileage revolutions in hours of operation\nBut these systems also log oil and cooling temperatures to see if the engine has had time to burn off\nCondon states in the oil some systems also use calendars to determine if it's time to change oil if the\nData is not set on the drivers Information Center all life monitor might not work\nI also use the calendar to make sure I have my own oil changes all lined up I have a calendar I parked on top of if I see you get the oil under certain man schedule change our sheet of notebook paper does affect\nThe most important thing is to remember is that the estimates of the health of the oil and build around specific oils recommended by the automaker since the vehicle has no idea about the specifications of the oil is critical that the oil matches the oil life monitor\nNow the trick part\nResetting procedures ones that like goes off what do you do you go down to parse vary by some ... oil field right now you've got fresh oil ... lifestyle says you need a change\nWell typically they'll say that's a bad sense or over that ozone until you get a new part [laughter] there you go\nNo you just need to know how to reset it and there again I might point to the Internet just look up the oil\nWife reset procedure for your specific vehicle and I'm sure you'll find it there but nonetheless reset procedures\nNothing is more frustrating for customers and getting in a vehicle after an oil chase this is something that you've had somebody else good and that is quite frustrated and they should be professional enough to reach that the oil monitor life for you\nFor is not all the cars have a huge so it might just plumb forgot\nWhile I just said that most of them do since so seven away to know eleven [laughter]\nAnyway um [noise]\nAnd say that the all life monitor is not been reached that either the technician did not realize the vehicle had to reset procedure or he did not want to look it up\nBut it's safe to assume that every two thousand seven are newer vehicle has a reset procedure the problem can involve are doing the hokey pokey with the keys and the buttons and the gas pedal to go through a ... a menu is on the drivers Information Center\nSome have three steps while others have up to eight\nThat have to be performed with military timing\nNo matter the reset procedure information is vital when resetting oil life monitors chances for information it is and the owner's manual or of the vehicle\nBut do you want to be a rummaging around their glove box and trying to find that for yourself you know you you as professionals need to know and the customer who owns the car should also be aware of what it's gonna take a something comes to mind there I've had it for quite a few years\nBecause I think that came out and run early to thousands also you actually have to have a special tool\nFrom BMW to redo the BMWs sounds about right [laughter]\nWhich we own uh-huh 'cause we we weren't going to send it out of the shop but\nIt's a clip and the recess toll for ten seconds\nYeah bad or or you just get the mileage button you've got one leg out of the car and your right hand over\nThe passenger seat and show for less than the paper clip and the whole and bingo you got everything it's a two man job [laughter] [noise] uh\nIt's also important to use the oil is not a recommended by the manufacture for the longevity of the engineering engine life\nI was glad that ah there again the reset procedures I've got a couple of pages talked about here but we're gonna run out of time on that uh when I talked only about the intervals should happen out here in Bullhead and what we call a severe weather condition\nBecause of the excessive climate changes uh I Would say that you need to shorten it down to three to five thousand miles sounds about right\nThere's no way they recommend most times anyway well with the in the olden days\nWell even today as the these people are getting used to driving around for ten thousand miles and then wonder why after eighty or Ninety thousand miles inside of their engine looks like the city done [laughter] yeah so you you got to change it more often than that\nAll right

Wilson here I don't want to take a chance let you go forward on fourth in one and that was what was surprising but the cowboys\nAnd even Jerry Jones and why don't want to second guess Jason Garrett but we should take the risk that scones second guessing your code\nNo question about it and and you know ... and Dallas needs a spark right now they're not getting it they know that he got his ego Eliot arguably the best running back in the game although\nI think they caught Barclay if he had a a decent office of wind would be treading this league right now but that being said you know you can't play not to lose that that's the old school way the NFL was\nIf you watch the chiefs down and the rams at what they're doing in the aggressive approach that's a new NFL the rules allow the game we played that way so you have to be aggressive\nAnd I think it's the Doug Peterson effect on the on the NFL's you mentioned oh Dale back um comes out prior to the game in an interview with the mother ship any questions Eli questions his coach and questions whether he wants to stay in New York and then take credit for the giants playing a competitive game against Carolina what do you make of this job\nWell I think a auto Becker but you just want to play football I think the guy is a tremendous football player but football is the consummate team game and once you wreck that locker room you wreck the team and he's well on his way to accomplishing the goal\nYeah I was just disappointed why don't you go to the lie and say how do I make you better or you know you go to your coach and you
