grand prize is my daughter has just been the Web master Web designer it looks very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going up to lately well that that's what we've had a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa ... who thinks the world that says I'm going to give you a special guest he's a mundane astrologer right and I went what what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIt's the astrology of nations of world leaders thing with like eclipse is new moons full moons major planetary alignment in other words it's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results that same mundane astrology impersonal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWell again kind of it's the maker causing rather than microcosm so\nPeople who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of where it was they read the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties it's still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was\nI was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMarch tell us exactly what ... is\nWell what we said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgypt and Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know I'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy\nWho is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so\nMuch and I also studied\nAll kinds of things we regarding Atlantis or when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics\nLived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo nothing the planets keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days\nEach planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we would call ... ...\nFor a million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the plot of snow this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point oh it's kind of like\nA this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but there are like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now in two thousand eighty and if you if I went to Google Earth far one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear and then you click on images it's fill George with all kinds of things like stop science and road signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you have five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really have studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know\nPeople want to hear a prediction you're going to go however\nAstrology really works best in terms of ... as you said and he's studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else\nBut he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use the scope before whatever is born at a moment of time has the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person who's born and they have a particular astrology charts\nAnd at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of the early ... and the U.S trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but ... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ... kinda who have been around the horn along time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just in Charlotte I'm Glad you asked that question I\nOkay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that science rather reticent to to be a for instance do welcome to planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff a much more focused that's why the Monday and astrology virtual things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\n... in sports Russia logically psychic like okay stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer does this website great barrier enterprises dot com or\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that\nThe the people call this planet burn is Iran enough ... uranium depending on their pronunciation but that planet the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one\nWhen the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was cited by William Herschel and ironically and bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nAnd the New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two [noise]\nAnd so not yet but in oh five years\nUh you're on the fence about seven years in a sign\nThat planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shocked and surprised is Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year\nBut it is a little bit down the road although [noise]\nTimes in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nWhich takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six you get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers are my field people look at these kind of thing was like a a nation's chart\nOf nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in the number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about Chris zones now crypto does\nThis this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which of the largest fine if they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were chart and believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers\nThey were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a\nWhat's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn and have been an earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know\nWhat what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merge together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air sides and the point here is that crypto currency is on more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes yeah I guess you could say that's\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parent prizes in our our our earth Aquarius news zones so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well then you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend who said that he was a drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother die from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of Monday and astrology\nAlways look at the heart of a personal though you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nCan I put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen well yeah well the thing is is that ... there's\nI don't think it'll happen but well yeah\nWell the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there are certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal is if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else is going to be nominated\nIn ... in his place so it's not as if it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there the other squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot by you my question was the lure her do you think you'll get confirmed Yvonne\nI'm asking the logically thinking\nWell after logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control and you have there to get them that that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right not not that I that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll and I'll say now you at least you took the stand right\nBecause when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably when she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college and Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they're going to have nuclear weapons and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false one or not a kind of you do these kind of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day or the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nNew Hampshire did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during the ... I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know of Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing his trek\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology and this is very important Donald Trump's chart President Trump Detroit is known we've known as exact birth time for decades it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong il on\nTheir report to his word in Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five he's definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think that the north Koreans and\nHe calls us to action

those\nWell I mean I don't want to specifically focus on the wall Street Journal they've been sort of against the idea of changing after from the beginning you have to start with the with\nThe position was NAFTA and its current state good or bad well we have large deficits\nEvery everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and\nPeople would suggest don't upgrade it is a crazy and then in addition to changes in the economy we are very large deficits and we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parks and companies\nTo Mexico and other places so the people say we shouldn't have to have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just an engaging in self deception I might I might know that\nBoth the secretary Clinton and President Obama boats when they ran for ...\nThat it needed to be re done so [noise] what the president did which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history at one point\nTwo trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who have to pay my bills and do I care about and better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America\nThe there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis\nWe call it a review provision their labor rights which should never been like this ever in an agreement before there's access on agriculture there's there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital trade and intellectual property protection financial services all these\nThese ah twenty first century economy kinds of things that we're no adequate rules and that we have um there's even very good rules\nAre on the environment which are beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very\nStrong and enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data locals ... which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how state owned enterprises which is you think China Ken subsidize so there's\nThere's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important agreement better than than anything in the states as everybody goes she had it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is the that the President Trump trade a prototype and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators and getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement I bought one of the things that were wondering how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing when there's there are some Republicans supporting it\nSome probably won't like more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats little posted in in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or the thinking doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think ah the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticisms you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan\nFor working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being purely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she hated\nThat I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood from CNBC than civically regarding autos let's listen\nThere are some elements of managed trade in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work means our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they will be worth it for automakers to comply\nWhich means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your school I guess\nMy I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that they're they're so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all the ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing\nYeah that's a good thing they've all set is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know\nThat is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take him to sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just reading something about it and they'll realize\nHow they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be really very very important for him for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe had to end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content\nOf cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff we're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that bad things under under the ... the person who's going to lose out on this is China\nAnd places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't talk about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America now it could be Canada also but in America for the most part\nThat's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those car should be made in America by American labor\nWell I think what President Trump prominence on his on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bible Lighthizer us TR what's next I\nMean he kept the European countries ... deals with Switzerland or some of these other smaller countries\nI Know they've and Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with you guys I Know that first hand\n[noise] yeah no we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise] we have a lot of things that we're doing a small deals dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go\nThrough but there's a bunch of other countries do and then of course the big the big elephant in the room is China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you just one last time on the\nWall Street journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things are so to say oh look at this was bad for the U.S and the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced his ... his thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like\nOne of those what are the things you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite is and then the other ones you should look at it I I ask\nAny of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nI'm looking I'm actually looking at it now and January twenty second march eighth but

I I don't even have words for that it's outrageous but I don't think this goes over well in middle America I don't think it goes over well in most places outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts or\nMaybe it on the college campuses speaking of the college campuses this uh Georgetown professor we're going to be\nDelving into more of this a Republican senators should die miserably ... pigs for supporting cabinet and she has had a hit\nCan you imagine if a professor who was even even modestly a Republican said anything resembling of it at the vitriolic nature of what this professor Christine fair at Georgetown said\nWould that would that slightly Republican professor survive\nProfessor would be run off campus not that there aren't many Republican professors anyway\nWould be run off campus that that's that's that's ... that's ... you're expressing your expressing male aggression or if it's a well we already had one ... a male professor have to apologize for making a simple comment\nSimple comment about credibility and Christine Fort get into more of this but the double standard is just\nUnbelievable\nThe views of faculty members expressed in their private capacity or their own and not the views of the university does that mean if someone express racist views on Twitter that that person would not\nWould not be fired from Georgetown\nOur policy does not prohibits speech based on a person presenting ideas or the context of those ideas even when those ideas maybe difficult controversial or objectionable while faculty members may exercise freedom of speech we expect that their classrooms and interaction\nWith students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell when you go to go on that rate your professor website um some interesting reviews of this particular professor teaching style come up\nA namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this in a conservative wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in her classroom it's simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worst or lectures or never supported just presented unvarnished dogma this is not what Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor\nRating [noise] so this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor\nIn his private capacity tweeting support for Kavanaugh\nFor anything at using the same type of language toward Christine Ford supporters he would be fired they would figure out a way to run him off campus even if he were tenured that figure out a way to do even if they had to pay him that get them off campus\nDo you agree with me a five five forty Laura uh we'll talk more about this a and a woman who knew Christine Ford in at North Carolina state will get to that and a lot more coming up\nWhat you think about ... percent it by liberty mutual insurance liberty mutual customers is your auto insurance but you only pay for what you need so why aren't more things in life customize\nWhy isn't a burger cheaper when you ask for no one\nSo shouldn't you to duck the price of the onion right otherwise I'm paying for the onions but I'm not receiving any you\nWe allow this to happen and people are saying is that he's he doesn't have a right to the Supreme Court well\nAccusations and accuser does not have the right to be elite they just simply don't this message about women than ... worth that we are to leave them simply because they're women simply because there are many of them are victims that there have been abuses in the past\nBut this isn't that the standard by which we judge people we judge people on facts rationality and the judge people\nBased on what can we present and the evidence not on feelings and this attack on Kavanaugh's grilling how about you know do you remember blacking out you remember getting drunk you've never would have behaved in college and just always the presumption of guilt going forward and in every way that they\nHave questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nNow describe if you don't mind your thoughts on on Christine forward given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate\n\nI I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her type friendship here but I was in her circles and I know the environment that she was saying that we were all in especially our freshman and sophomore year we were\nPartying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and my point and bringing it up\nNot to blame her for\nHer you know if she were she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way to get raped but my point is if you only have he said she said if you don't have any corroborating evidence and you need to look at the character of both people you need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing at college and you know what\nIf you look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing it in college and you know we should be ... you know you're going to grill Brett Kavanaugh about this she also needs to be looked at as well because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of corroborating evidence and you can't forget that weight\nAnd she also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that yes she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that period shops that changed the timeframe from being\nIn the mid eighties or early eighties she kept pushing it back and forth with it happened in college or is it happened in high school you know really flush out exactly what her story as much as you were on the stand a lawyer with real or about that they wouldn't grill her about the details of hurt conduct that got me on how we have to hold her with kid gloves\nRight and again feminine it's we're supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own they're not a bunch a damsel in distress and yet\nIroned out the right on the ... last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to the a credibility gap for ms Ford in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a sex crime prosecutor who my political figure who said look changing narratives changing story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear\nOr not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of crop rating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nWell that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because I didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest I'm and she didn't she didn't ... like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing that so Trump traumatized her\nFor four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and re decorating and you know we had he had no emotion that corresponded with what she was staying cookie TST and trauma and horrors of it all was there would've been more anger\nThere were more fear and passion and more directed a she was attached she her anytime she ever talked about the assault\nShe was very touching her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can associate associate when the race and stuff that she wasn't right\nAnd this is thirty six years later and she said she has PATS the which means that you're heightened awareness of what happened and so she just did not she was not ... to me and feelings or fat but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts and the facts didn't measure up she lived in an environment and in high school that was very party environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance\nOf her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with the contracts with us right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that you know we've got a really really need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or Catholic\nIt's about our uh liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principles that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nAttacking people in public restaurants or elevators or\nYou know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they were driven by\nIrrationality they've banned in fact\nThey've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level it's all they have their subjective feeling and power\nAnd if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of object objective truth in order to have dialogue than the most powerful the biggest bully in the room it's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of rolling\nTheir bullying everyone in order to advance their power and it's important that students ... there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are\nTrying to use you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on and different kinds of fears now what's going on and\nThis is what's been going on our culture it's been going on and different kinds of the earth now what's going on and and to tighten relationship scare and women and its ripping our country apart\nAnd if we if this means that we have to let ... rapist go free because we can't prove that it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent and it is to round up all the guilty oh it's actually the fact that just real life that that's what it's about being in a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake who lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look at me watch me watch me\nYou must listen to me don't you dare look away from me it's like a kid just like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorist is a type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel they have to feel the heat right back on them\nAs as a journalist when I say this in a in a in a way meaningless journalists don't like to demonize the fake news and so forth but imagine if journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their faith screaming at them at it I think they'd be the first ones to say wait a second you're timid ending the press but what about intimidating a a a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station it's as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them and it does that count at all apparently not you\nKnow and and but ... and like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nA ... that's one of my reasons for challenging\nA Christine Ford about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing or anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she with then and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecuting him than we need to ask for the same kind of questions\nAnd you know you can't answer it can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in the political sphere then why should we ... we are not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to ... just because you're allowed and bowling and yelling at us and and the restaurants\nYou know we're we're not you know we're not going to have to take it for you\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election was all about the ...\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of bad policies bad economic policies bad foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called me up on all of it\nAnd he said look I'm Out of it and I've done all this thing but uh this is just ridiculous and I what before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the
