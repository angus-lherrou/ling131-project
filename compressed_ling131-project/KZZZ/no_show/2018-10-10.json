by them Ninety four going on\n[noise] the name of the book is Christians in the age of outrage and it is very Frank it talks about ah what\nChristians can and should do and also have not done and how we're actually hurting ourselves um you talk about our God really kind of being identity no new slain that at\nLike open we we've kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise] um I think that's the part of the problem but but I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and\nAnd and then that faction sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately\nAre we the volume just goes up up up up in the anger just goes up up up up and and we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes to use the term but history will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I kept solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react and how do we\nRespond and the answer is is not to take our identity from anything other than\nPick apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things here you've got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do I'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react to how do we\nRespond and the answer is is not to take her identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this in this focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does and\nTo acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian and following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ and his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we college my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this Scott hates that blah blah blah they're just despicable you don't win\nBy by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church because somebody's spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I I on my desk actually right every front of me a name plates and costs are they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news I\nCan't use one of the words probably on the radio but I'll lying the false prophet and so it's actually one of my staff made it into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way I see the rap does he does either Baptist church\nBut but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of the members of the family as well a Christian so somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with people who deeply disagree with us in the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed\nAnd in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a\nIs the president by oil university which is a Christian university in California uh met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party and state legislature there in California that was trying to change laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more well he ended up getting to understand each other better\nThe will of the bill was ultimately not moved forward was dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying that Christians need to try to do that\nAnd I do think that in doing so well act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in is not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst\nThings I see on social media I I click on a link and I find go to the bio and its first think listen the thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christians\nWho I mean I I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you I'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're gonna come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit\nAnd we're going to crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said\nWe understand we forgive you for that we're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death\nAnd they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was this emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this and the book and he he actually he's called the apostate because you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent and and here's what he writes because he's so angry about trying to hold back the advance of Christians he's a pagan\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty or they already sell more books than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and they're they're about to spend more on original programming than even Netflix\nOr they're going to be the biggest Hollywood producer [laughter] to so many things is it time to I mean I don't know what you do about it do you favor as a capital is breaking up a company that's what they did to Microsoft that's what they did to a or they tried to to Microsoft has what they did with mountain bell I'm\nYvette mountain bill was in with the government\nI mean that was a that was protected by the government and part of a you know that was that was a protected property you couldn't you couldn't start anything against them right that's why yeah I mean you know you could start your own Amazon you're not going to compete\nOn I think there are other options you know there are other options are just ... you know the problem is\nBought I don't think there are other options you know there are other options are just ... you know the problem is Amazon does everything better than everybody else\nYou know this is a real problem we we've been talking about this whole week is I don't I don't want you to change Amazon I like Amazon I like Amazon Prime I like the fact until yesterday we were trying to build a stupid volcano for um my daughter and\nTony went and got a three percent hydrogen peroxide and and we're reading and I'm like I think thirty five percent is a different kind of peroxide and it is I didn't I mean it's a dangerous kind of peroxide [noise]\nUm and we didn't have it so I go online and I'm like where can you get it Amazon [laughter] I mean it'll have you'll have tomorrow you know you had as ours I mean it's yeah I don't want them to change some of these things\nYeah and and we're the same way with Google and Google's getting pretty intrusive things right but we we like their search engine yeah we're like their browser their mail is greater mail is great I mean like free and so we\nJust we get it out or you feel good when it all off from Google Amazon you may say Margaret Amazon controls I mean people are like oh well I buy a lot of things for Amazon and that's obviously a big part of their business when they're cloud computing is really the main thing driving all their profit off of\nUm you know and it's a and so many places or use it every place you go on the Web based government young Amazon yeah I mean\nAnd it's like you know Alexa at this point is a\nIt's a luxury a product of moderate\nUtility right like I mean I feel like it's fun to play with like we use it as a speaker you ask if the weather every once in awhile I mean there's a couple of things you can do it but I mean like I I don't know as the likes of changing my life now as I Know rhino absolutely has changed my life yes yeah I mean it's ... I I ... from it yeah\nPrime out can deliver to your door within an hour yeah I mean\nYou could I think you could safely say Amazon has\nAlmost killed the them all\nYes yeah it most of the ... right I mean you know it's an between Amazon and Google they have totally changed the world [noise] well yeah yeah like there's a there's a big mall near where we're doing the show and Texas and you know it it still has tons and tons of stores in it but you start to notice the way it changes it's changing from a place to shop\nInto a place for experience it yes there are lots of things for kids in lego stores and aquariums they took one of the big box stores\nAnd they made it into a giant um it's I think it's called the field house it's a giant gym with like twenty five basketball courts in all lead is going more as entertainment yeah what's more of an entertainment complex as it has to go yeah\nWell it's not necessarily a bad thing I mean I don't get it's a cool you go somewhere and have an experience with other people and then people bring things to your door it's fed pounds\nSo can I can I can I tell you about the experience I had last last week and I have to tell you it is\n[noise] okay\nThe only thing ... you get to be rich it's the same problems just bigger okay ... uh is there is one game changer and that is private air travel that changes your life entirely okay on that same\nMedia ...

N. K. triple Izzie you I'm Dan how It's Wednesday and that means we actually have Dave Lourdes here in the studio founder of ... you might have even seen him in the newspaper is the original road\nRunner well after the original one opening up Laughlin ranch boulevards as the other week Dave uh how you doing\nI'm good how are you doing I'm feeling pretty good you know it's been two weeks since I've been here or did you mentioning you know I Want to ask you about that I got no cards no letters nothing from you it's\nBeen an absolute state of chaos ever since you left I have no idea where you went and all of a sudden you're back regularly that\nTwo weeks ago I was even though I wasn't here ... did the show yes and I actually listen to it at the airport in Miami oh yeah no kidding\nAnd then last week I ... I have a great excuse I'll give you the note from my from my parents that are All right I wasn't here because we had the grand opening of often rents boulevard which was extremely exciting had a great turnout and wonderful day for the community and everybody involved\nSo someone who wrote opens you get to go and got a ribbon make it real fifties\nYeah there's a lot of fun we had two or three hundred people there the reception no kidding that was a good turnout listen up the stats this week uh brought you us again by ... or re max ranch to river real T um [noise] these are two weeks ... we're going to catch up from two weeks ago\nA Bullhead city as of this date has sold nine hundred and thirty five homes over the last two weeks they have sold sixty two homes\nAh Fort my hobby has sold three hundred and eighty seven homes to date and in the last two weeks they've sold to a thirty homes\nMy hobby valley or has sold one hundred and sixty and in the last two weeks they sold nine homes and here for Kingman a they had sold one thousand Ninety two homes to date\nAnd they have sold eighty nine homes since two weeks ago and that's really important because today a you know sometimes we have we have a lot of listeners from king\nBut we haven't really spend a lot of time on team in real estate the topics\nWere a little bit biased towards Bullhead but that's just because that's where we physically are well today we're gonna we're gonna solve that\nDilemma uh we've got a Dwayne Patterson from re max prestige properties he's going to be on the phone with us and we're going to discuss all the stats are about Kim in cars there seem to be having a phenomenal year\nThey're up to thirty percent or last year\nUh their little head of Bullhead city which is uh twenty eight percent or more hobbies up twenty percent and Mali valleys up four percent so it's all good and what's exciting is that the um the numbers while they're up in ... and a lot of questions about this uh uh their average is one hundred and sixty thousand aren't\nEspecially a reasonable considering the surrounding areas LA Phoenix Vegas oh\nYou don't get a garage for a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in LA [laughter]\nSo easy to find people that come from all over the you know different areas of the country and cheese came in ... you know I'm I'm always interested in hearing stories and it's amazing to me that um response that people talk about with how nice people are here you know like I said it's it's pretty much all I've ever known for for\nUm being a home so you know you just kind of normal but to hear other people talk about\nYou know just walking into a grocery store and somebody makes I contact and says lower holds the door for you in shape your hand and you know the people really seem to like the community feel that we have\nHere you know you're up thirty percent over last year Dwayne I'm In residential cells um and uh you know everybody went through the downturn two thousand two thousand nine um Europe thirty percent over last year\nOr do you ... are you feeling that trend increasing are moving forward throughout the next year or next year to\nWell I I think\nBecause of our old place will Haitian climate there's always going to be a lot of people people want to come here I think a lot of it has to do was the flip the national market does mhm uh and it has a lot to do with the industry that we can draw into the community to produce good paying jobs\nYou know will you know uh I just went through the numbers you talked about affordability a Bullhead city on the average is one sixty nine months for my hobby on the average is one Seventy eight\nMojave valleys one sixty seven and Kingman as to what you just said is one hundred and sixty so it seems like they get a pretty good value for their dollar up there in Kingman right now\nThey do and and sense of city came when does not have a property tax that is very attractive to people moving here from other states as well\nIt's very attractive to people moving here from other states as well how much of an impact is forty\nTwo during during the ... I mean from a transportation standpoint is that one of the things that people look at it as being able to get somewhere quick\nYes definitely I mean you know our location I forty or what having interstate eleventh it it makes it pretty quick whether you're going from here to LA or air to Albuquerque it's it's a good road all the way a quick throw\nYou know you're only thirty minutes from Bullhead city and reverse the riverside the Laughlin uh casinos I was thinking riverside casino but I'm a you know you're a you're a half hour away 'cause I drive a once a week each direction um so the but the question is what's the elevation\nThere um and the reason is I Want to get to the temperature differential during the summer as\nWell are you about a thousand about what about thirty thirty three hundred feet so uh I think on average in the summer we're usually\nFifteen degrees on average tour of and boy it steady like heresy city\nHow much time and I think about well probably about ten Fifteen degrees degree yeah it's it's it's not uncommon that you know we talk about the high nineties you know we definitely see triple digits once in a while but um it's not not the norm ah so you know Ninety eight hundred and one\nI Would say is that the hottest we usually get the big difference for thirty minutes away\nThirty minutes away from the river so forth you know one of the things are the types of fires you just touched on that a minute ago\nAre there you have a lot of retirees are but you also find um people there because one of the things we're going to talk about in a minute or a Johnny is the uh the discussion we had with your economic development guy and the airport are you finding a more people coming there for jobs\nThat you've seen in the past\nYeah I I think we get a lot of um teachers seemed to be moving out here from different areas of the country when they get out of school um they came in regional medical center obviously is one of the largest employer so we get a lot of doctors nurses physical therapist all of that\nUm the ... you know a lot of county job so you know we on top of like I mentioned earlier the retirees we do have a lot of younger professional moving as well\nAs the commercial stuff continues to grow when we get more options for food and shopping and that kind of stuff you know it's it's a little more attractive to a families\nAnd younger people as well but you know you are as the sign says the heart of route sixty six or\nYou get millions of people a year the drive through Kingman a percentage of those people stop a ... I Would imagine that some of them kind of maybe take a minute and look around and think well maybe that's a good place to live too\nYeah I'm sure there's people for sixty to end up moving here you know I have had over the years a couple of people said well we drove through team when every year for the sixty six festival and we just finally decided we live here [noise]\nYou know your average sales prices one sixty ... uh I'm not the most familiar with the town I Know a fairly well but uh I don't know my ... a subdivision names but um what part of ... seems to be quote the\nHottest part of town not temperature wise\nI I honestly think everywhere I mean if you drive through king and in any direction you'll see new construction going up I mean there's there's pockets all you know in every direction north south east and west um you know I think probably the south east port or seems to be growing quite a bit\nAlong I forty and uh with the talks of a new enter changes and that stuff coming in forty that will continue mob I I don't think that there's any one direction where you know it's a lotta predominant girl it's really in every direction at this time\nWell that's really really good just a curiosity or if someone was to connect via they can buy a lot somewhere right and have a house milk\nIn parts of the\nFamily there's there's there's plenty of la Salle on you know a lot of different sub division that's one of the things we're\nSeeing a much different than some other areas you know people are used to wear a developer comes in and buy all tracks of land and they'd go without right I'm ... still on Locke though are so some of the older neighborhoods there's still some available lots even some of the new subdivision\nThat were started or you know in the last real estate boom I'm a lot of those laws were sold off to whether they were investors or they were going to be end users that chose not to use them or by their you know you can still find several locked in different areas they will they'll\nYeah I was trying to get a baseline number to figure uh to get to your average one sixty or what would a lot cost or an average life nothing spectacular just kind of an average lots in and you pick the area [noise]\nYeah I mean in in central came when it came when you're probably looking around twenty twenty five thousand you get the southeast part town you're in between\nFive thousand you get the southeast part ... your ... thirty to thirty five thousand maybe already though with the no side a lot [noise] what's the most expensive\nArea in Kingman\nUh I Would say the southeast corner as you get up into the the L law I'm Out\nI was just going to ask you about that I went to for the first time ever I didn't even know it existed slap my face or the while the pipe park up on a up on the top of the mountain\nAnd what I went to out a political function for the Republicans back in August I Believe and I drove up there and that was stunningly beautiful and if people haven't driven up there they owed themselves a weekend trip so to drive up there it's amazing you know there you've got the big pine trees go lodge you've been up there there\nAre a couple of times actually I wanted to ask you if a Kingman is quite large enough to have neighborhood names I always like to hear those colloquial as it was you know something like a bit courthouse row or something like that\nI don't know what\nWe have too many we've got wretch of Santa Fe is a popular subdivision or for ill a follower an area that's out of town it's kind of taken on that nickname this the families validated many years ago uh but yeah we do our we have too many names what's different\nSufficient you talking about that and drive up for the wall applies mountains which was stunning a beautiful um there are there were a lot of homes being built along that road that go up there or your average is one sixty what would be a ...\nWhat would be the top end of your market in terms of a real ... a residential homes with all\nThose little ... that area of new construction spread anywhere from then on the upgrades anywhere from one or two to five or six years where but\nWow that's that's actually a good deal at one sixty and it\nSeems like a great by especially when you get up on top there I look back you got some great views looking back over the whole valley there it's incredible\nYeah I mean that that the a lazy why use subdivision that they're there for the most part let alone five acre parcel\nWhat was the name of that ... what was the name of that development lazy why you\nSee that's the one you were looking for Dan that easy why you\nGot about six hundred dollars in my pocket if you look you can give me a couple of square feet in that area [laughter]\nYeah well okay so that I Am so the hills area it is kind of the upper end area as you mentioned and then the the average or upper averages are spread out to ... as you said every direction or the south and west\nI\nThat's that's fantastic well uh you know that when we come back we've got about a thirty second stuff when we come back um I'd like to throw in a some questions about the commercial development and the commercials is up there\nI Would say roughly a thirty percent vacancy rate out there yes uh on on available buildings and and it down to about three or four percent now you know Johnny not used to have seven eight ten lists teams out there and I think right now we have about two listings it's just a a much available\nWell a couple of things come to mind immediately about that came in ... park one you have real service and you have an I ... interstate freeway basically bordering that project so for transportation for prisoners and moving goods or services or whatever it seems like an ideal location\nIt it is a good location or\nIt's just things are very limited out there the amount of space available for growth\nIs somewhat limited and it also Andrew is on the Federal Aviation administration they're releasing more to land that could be build on right now I Believe there is only about a hundred and twenty maybe a hundred and thirty acres of land that is actually available to be built\nReally that that that shocks me ... when you drive on\nI forty and I actually uh about a month ago I drove a from ... to ... when I decided to drive the route sixty six wrote and that was awfully enjoy them\nI had a good time stopped at a couple of little restaurants along the way and just and I said but as you come in on the route sixty six you come in there basically at the entrance to the airport\nAnd ah there were several trains backed up there ah that seemed like there was a a lot of buildings in a lot of land that shocks me that there's only a hundred and twenty acres available up there how can they get more\nYeah that that is land that is available that has been released by the federal government or this airport was originally used\nYou know back during World War two for a support system for for other airports are fighter jet Johnny's Iraq were you there\nWas actually a [laughter] why my previous life ... exactly well\nOh okay [laughter] I ... my previous life exactly well yeah I I\nIt was a training thing for World War two was at a fires bombers that all that kind of stuff right\nYeah\nYeah the ... but then they expanded it now you know one thing I've always been curious you see everybody sees it from my forte is when you drive and you look over towards there you see at least I Do uh I've seen dozens and dozens of planes most of them with the details insignia on the side what is that all about\nA there's a couple of companies out there that that store those planes for the companies are there's also several companies out there that are that they use the plains part say rebuild them and sell 'em all so there there's a constant turnover of these jets out that\nOne of the helpful things about ... minutes it's got an it's it's kind of similar a temperature is here at things keep a little more stable when you're trying to storm I think the humidity is the key that too yeah I've got another caller here from one to try and take 'em yeah just will take one call and we'll come right back to doing All right color you Iran would live in local who are you how are you\nYeah Hi my name's Dave and that I uh I uh thought I'd have a little information are leaving guarding the airport at the airport was originally a require quite the city uh they hired a city uh employee\nOr who is now the airport manager yup he started last\nA third of October ... prior to that we had an interim airport manager um\nWho did a fantastic job and uh we expect the same from Steve Johnston it's a new city airport manager\nWhat uh what are the ... would be his goals that he has to uh to work with what is his objective to now that he has a job\nWell I I think you should probably ask him that you know a number of generals\nIf they want to redevelop but they want to they want to bring more business in the areas that the whole idea you know just things you've heard that\nThey want to bring in more business they want to bring in more aviation wow they want to make it far more friendly to business and she can win grill as somebody previously said it we have\nA real service we have a two major highways a U.S Ninety three that goes to Phoenix yup a student being interstate eleven hallelujah or what have shown in the next\nTwenty years um it'll also go to Las Vegas and then we have interstate forty which are between the two with the rail service at a a nice airport with two runways or or an ideal place for\nAny business that is a wanting to service the southwest\nYeah no doubt about it at the airport is a jewel Lincoln was crowned ... and it's got an ... an rounded for development just ...\nIt's got a lot of room that is all airport land the land was donated to the city by the federal government at the end of World War two\nUh when they were a demolishing a a whole lot airplanes like thousands of farmers\nAre better nationally the airport was eight Gary training shatter for Seventeen uh airport hair army air corps crews\nAre but\nIt's you know where the old k-mart was we don't have a K. Mart any longer nobody does but at one time there were Palmer stacked up next to each other all the way to the uh what is now the Kmart area\nAlright some great hobby about getting when I Want to thank you so much for calling in German that what\nThey were gonna watch the ... we're going to watch it now that you brought it to our attention we're gonna watch or how the new um how the new director does and ... and when he put in you know we should get him on the phone and we should get him on the call or here's some day in the next few a few days we need to find out about this\nYou got those connections Mr Lewis show is what we're doing I mean I promise you were going to find out who that guy is and we're going to track him down and have 'em on here All right\nHow long have you his name ...

Dan Patrick show a little bit later on we'll talk to the Dodgers manager Dave Roberts Matthew Stafford is alliance will stop buying a Yankee broadcaster Michael Kay [noise] sums up\nA disappointing end of the season for the Yankees and the Yankees Red Sox American linked divisional series didn't live up to the high cost and meeting New York last night for games [noise]\nNow there were no moments like the bloody soccer Bucky up and dance but that's okay because\nWe criticize baseball probably more than any other sport of living in the past and now we have an opportunity to put the past behind us and maybe form some new history too great matchups in the league championship series and no offense to the Yankees but the red Sox and Astros they're the two best teams in the American league\nThey might be the two best teams in baseball but these are two of the better American League teams we've seen in a long time and it should be a great series and that should more than make up for the anti climactic American League divisional series\nAnd I think it's fair to say the same thing about the Dodgers in brewers I think we're going to look at the red Sox and the Astros and say that should be for the world series or those are the two best teams but that's not the way it works and that doesn't mean the Dodgers are Yankees aren't going to be whoever survives the American league championship series\nBut you're going to love watching Milwaukee the Dodgers you're gonna have name recognition there and this is a franchise that has been on the cusp before I saw a couple of columns in the LA Times bill ... said well the Dodgers have to get to the world series\nYou know the Dodgers have to win the world series I don't think anybody's going to be happy if they just wait a go to the world series if you're a Dodger fan oh you got to win it that's the difference here the expectation level and look at these two teams in the American link\nYou know you're winning a hundred game the Yankees won a hundred games\nYou know the red Sox at an all time record for the red Sox\nI mean this is an easy anymore\nIt shouldn't be easy anymore and you know you're going to be surprised if the series don't go the distance at least I Will it's time for baseball to make some new memories and this is great but it's a great match up here and I love the fact that the brewers are in there\nBecause the brewers played great baseball it's because the brewers an Astros play great baseball and the Astros somehow we're not on anybody's radar because it's the Astros\nAnd and I understand where you know Alex fragments said look why are we planning in the afternoon now he has to understand what they how TV Works you might be the best team you might be the defending chance that doesn't mean you're a draw just ask the San Antonio spurs\nAnd nobody's clamoring to watch the San Antonio spurs even though they were great efficient of you know they were\nMy dynasty and they won they won a lot\nWe still didn't want to see you are like oh no the spurs are back on the phone but that's the same with the Astros although the Astros are more exciting than the spurs were but you're still you know their their TVs\nPlan to these big market is not the Houston is not a big market but not thought of is a big market like New York or Chicago\nBoston Los Angeles and that's why I understand what the networks you know how you decide who you're going to uh have in there and when you're going to showcase though but uh and I'm like you're there and there but you know if you're the Astros you're there now\nSo take care of business here in primetime take care of business you can shut everybody else again shut them up\nThey had Patrick show brought you buy discover card they believe anniversary should be a sign of celebration not obligation that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving them and tried to discover will give new card members of one year anniversary gift I'll never forget at the end of your first year\nThey match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar no cats know catches try it and believe it or discover dot com slash match\nOnly for a new card members will be patient supply I to the club and got a poll question for me today\nOkay are you less excited about the playoffs now that the Yankees are not in it so to speak to the nine Yankee fan what do you think people would answer if we did that\nOh I don't know I think there's part of the audience that wants to see the Yankees lose and lose at that a bigger stage you know brighter spotlight on the fact that they ... the divisional series\nI Love the fact he got Red Sox and the Astros because of those are the two best teams and this is another thing and I I don't harp on it uh but but I Do mention it occasionally and it has to do with the on the analytics\nYou know the Yankees sent the all time record for home runs the sheer all time every position had at least twenty home runs this year for the Yankees but you have to be able to manufacture a run in the postseason\nCora was with the Astros last year he came to Boston this year and tries in is trying to incorporate what the Astros had the Astros\nPeter ... tries in is trying to incorporate what the Astros at the Astros used to be an all or nothing they struck out a lot you gotta put the bowl in play move a runner over you have\nTo make something happen because if you swing and miss you haven't put pressure on anybody but if I put the ball and play five move the runner over there's a ... whatever it is such
