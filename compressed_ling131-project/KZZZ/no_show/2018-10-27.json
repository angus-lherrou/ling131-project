yeah like [laughter] wow what\nA night last night part of the battle battleground talkers tour a whole bunch of people coming out and being energized invigorated optimistic there's such great news right now it feels like Republicans\n... as we know we've got a mountain to climb on November the ...\nLess than two weeks away Americans are going to decide whether or not we're going to the um the speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi weather British she Maxine Waters in positions of leadership in the in the end on on the house side we're going to see if Republicans are going to lose control of this the Senate\nOr will Republicans\nAre just lifted up by an incredible incredible amount of missteps\nAnd and ... and and news events that have happened in this country will will will take Republicans to another miracle finish sort of like what we felt in November of twenty sixteen welcome it too well the relief factor dot com studios we've got a real treat for you\nA few years ago I've done a lot of these traveling tours around the country and a ... a few years ago during the twenty sixteen campaign I had the chance to go\nOn a number of cities with Newt Gingrich I'm not one of these big a\nRich famous people who travels by private jet but once in a while I get to go on one of these\nUm multi city tours a on a private jet with some of my colleagues from the sale and radio network in one year in particular I got to go with Newt Gingrich from city to city I think we did fourteen cities and twelve days and I got to sit next to former house Speaker Gingrich on the plane\nFrom city to city and we would talk and he would tell stories I mean I I was just like ... at the needs of the master listening to this political giant\nUm a guy who has so much history and so much perspective Everytime I see him on my buddy Sean Hannity show a week nights on on Fox News channel I feel\nThat it was wrong to recommend well by the Taliban is killing Americans\nThat it's okay to join the enemy or you you have the same thing cats in the marsh Rogers has an opponent to uh try to raise a trip to Cuba\nBecause she didn't want to ask the defendant and every time you turn around and you find you know a ... who was the number two person in the Democratic party national congressman\nUh is now behind and his race\nFor attorney general and frankly a guy who goes around wearing a T shirt in Spanish that says low borders uh probably deserves to lose but in addition he's had so many other problems that are he's ... he made right down the entire tickets and the Democratic party in Minnesota so a lot of this has been\nVery profound change in the nature of what we're in the middle of then I think there are historic precedents once you accept the idea that this was a period of very profound change\nAnd not only that ... you know you you you you ... lift some of these examples of what seems to be so much\nOver the top instances of Democrats behaving badly and we're seeing a lot of we're seeing a kind of a mob mentality this week uh the house majority leader Kevin McCarthy's office in Bakersfield had a giant Boulder thrown through the glass\nA window we've seen Mitch McConnell and his wife harassed in restaurants I'm ... and ... and and and knew this was coming from the top you got Democrat leaders encouraging people to get in Republicans faces draw crowds chased them I mean the words\nThat comes faces draw crowds chase them out I mean the word suction unhinged time that uh\nGot to believe this bodes well for us in November the sixth because a lot of Americans Republican independent maybe even Democrats are saying the only way to to stop this from continuing is to put to keep Republicans in power because if these guys are in control heaven help us\nWhy I Do think that the uh the the whole notion of jobs not mobs or in the whole notion of how the former attorney general say when they're down kick them right oh I think for most Americans that's just way too much yeah and so I Do think in that sense that there's a\nSubstantial push\nUnderway uh and and I think that being if he said it was just really the country on to become a and you look at this mob coming up from Central America and there's no other way to describe it it's it's just an invading force\nOr at least seven thousand and uh somebody suggested last night that there was another couple of thousand coming out of\nWater Marlowe now to join that so it may well be a ton of twelve thousand before long ah you said if you will you really want to live in a world where these people believe they can come and impose on you or whatever they want\nAnd I think the Democrats are real bind\nI play a video clip yesterday I'm ready we're we're spending an hour with Newt Gingrich today on the Mike Gallagher show here in the relief factor dot com studios had a great event last night\nIn Philadelphia ... great great crowd for our battleground talkers tour tonight I'll be in Dallas uh and then later this weekend in Chicago so we're going around the country new knows these kinds of rallies very well it's fun to be with like minded people in a room full of excited energized\nUm citizens and or incidentally for ticket in Chicago a Freedom Summer could a battleground toured dot com battleground tour dot com\nI play that clip Mr Speaker yesterday of the president in Houston proudly proclaiming that he's a nationalist\nThe crowd roared with approval and then I follow that up with a clip from Don Lemon over at CNN who was literally just mortified\nOr at the word nationalist and he kind of conflated he seemed to tie in nationalist with I'm white nationalist white supremacist because he said the word nationalism is is a national TV\nAnchor host well nationalist as racist overtones anti Semitic overtones bigotry show I guess we're now at a place with the left\nWhere if you say you believe in America's sovereignty and you believe that America is the greatest nation on earth and you want to make America First as an American you're nothing but a stone cold begging\nFor that that is the modern left the modern laughs loyalty is to some kind of vague global assume that the president's speech at the United nations was brilliant\nAnd the first really solid defense of America as a patriotic foreign policy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew the real distinction\nOr do you want an American government that worries about America if you have this with is the smog coming up\nFrom ... from from Central America should the U.S government to decide that we want to take care of the entire planet and if that means that we bankrupt America we eliminate our freedom will destroy our prosperity but at least we met that John Lennon standard of ... you know caring about the global\nWhich was what ... what I always said that John Kerry really had to be getting in the past because he was actually the global secretary of state\nAnd that's why he can continue to meet with the Iranians up because he doesn't represent American faucet\nAnd and the Obama administration was I think the first over a global ... administration where we've ever had and their view was that the United states was in the weaker the United states was the better\nYeah but I but I have a theory too and I want to try this this ... out on you I don't believe Don Lemon\nOr any of these guys on the left in in the media the advocacy media is trying to stop the Trump agenda they don't believe\nThat Americans who ... who who feel the way we feel about the sovereignty of our country I proudly saying you you better believe were nationalist they don't believe we're racists they don't believe we're big and they don't they don't believe for anti Semite just just a way to chill the debate\nNow what they believe they believe all those bad things about you if you say nothing\n[laughter] just despite existing by\nExisting your ... and the French to them and they said this one insane\nFresher at Georgetown a woman who tweeted during the ...\nGeorge ... woman\nDuring the\nPeople who were all of a man named gang rape notice it she's now\nFind who he is or is it that much should stand watching them show and then cut off their shoes and feet from a professor at Georgetown\nWow that is that's that's the range which leads people to Kevin McCarthy sausage maker range which leads people to think what they can go into a restaurant\nAnd verbal abuse the majority of the U.S Senate his wife by the way is the secretary of transportation and she was what we need to understand the brown shrimp cherry mentality on the left\nAnd shut you and me calling us bad names do\nNew game ... getting rich is with us here on their special edition of the Mike Gallagher show an hour with new I'm Glad you're with a stick around because you mentioned the arrangement that your rain just coming from the left is not just coming from Democrats and I want to get your take\nOn some of the

you go down these major accomplishments of getting north and South Korea\nAt the two to the table of of of of all the the trade policies of the stuff that we've seen that has impacted people in their pocket book the lowest unemployment in the history of the country for black Americans for Hispanic Americans\nThese guys to a person they ignored each and every one of those accomplishments if they hated Trump because of his tweets for his personality or his style I get that I I I can understand a push back\nBut you but you can't do it in a vacuum and you can't do it while ignoring the things that are impacting millions and millions of Americans these policy achievement that we use conservatives have been dreaming about for decades\nWell I think the\nFirst of all these people don't care about the evidence\nMay have made a judgment that they have to find their life around this are the worst thing that could happen to them will be for Trump to be a great success because they are dedicated to believing that he has to fail\nAnd of course you know used to but you see this I mentioned earlier earlier that ah when you're in great in the story through your age\nYou have these kinds of changes right uh when Jeff when the Jeffersonian is one of the federal is literally died out by Eighteen twelve or so or when Jackson won the anti Jacksonian hated him so much that he did not get a good biography until Nineteen forty five\nMuch that he didn't like any good biography until Nineteen forty five over a hundred years later because the the week the aristocracy wouldn't tolerate writing nice things about Jackson a Lincoln one people feared help bitterly divisive we fought a civil war over it\nUh and and and that's the one he was he was described as best man by conservatives who wouldn't even say is late and the Al Smith who had been the Democratic presidential nominee in Nineteen twenty eight left the Democratic party in Nineteen thirty six because was now too liberal than FDR Dennis ...\nBut he concluded that FDR gone too far to the soil and you go through periods of this kind of change\nYou're going to see some people switch in that direction of the change agent and some people forming sort of a fossilized ... and that's what the anti Trump which will be cut me they're not only fossilized remnant of a group a group that used to be dynamic and now it just sits in the corner and ... and says bitter pinch\nAnd you know you talk about the ... that they are defined by trying to prevent his success arguably he's been an enormous success she look twenty months into this presidency\nAnd and you see the accomplishments on the judiciary you see what's happened with the court with the Supreme Court on down\nThe economy foreign policy domestic Newt it's not it's not a stretch to say we've just seen an enormously successful twenty ... twenty months of the Trump Administration is that is that fair\nYeah look I think I think that you do that Louis now getting if you're a liberal and says this is where it's a little hard to understand and never accomplish miniature a liberal having the most successful\nConcert with the judge process in history right literally in his she'd better than Reagan but when I was more better than it's nobody's business got gotten as far as the chefs are\nBut if you're surely that's an amazing and cheap care which actively\nAbout the economy having the lowest black unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history I mean the best overall record us and I think fifty years\nUm those things out to be seen as pawns needs and and you have to say at some level the slides succeeding but if you are never Trump where you can't say that\nYou're not ... you can't because it ruins your own your credibility they they they feel that that that would destroy their own\nRelevance and their credibility I guess Newt Gingrich is with us we're enjoying an hour with Newt and he's the author if there's one must read book
