we're in fifty countries now George and are so so very proud of that we have five thousand products to deal with over nine hundred different diseases and ah it's just that we run into this all over the world and it's just a very gratifying to be able to help so many people\nDoctors stories that I had a couple of weeks ago that I say you know when you were going to view on was and you've talked about this but eating food like bacon and sausages they say may raise the risk of breast cancer what's going on here\nBut it's an absolute fact or you know if my thesis for my postdoctoral fellowship and the sixties and seventies I did twenty thousand autopsies I'm Seventeen thousand some change over four hundred and fifty four species zoo animals and\nThree thousand humans are looking for a ... a common threads where animals were getting the same um diseases and death from the same pollutants 'cause everybody knew the earth is going to end until he's from pollution as human and what he found was of course\nThat uh there were no deaths from a pollution um but but I did find that when people ate one serving a day with a male or female they one serving a day of any\nProcessed meat things like Delhi slices sandwich meat sauce and bacon baloney salami pastrami pepperoni jerky armies bam trees or those kinds of things um increase their risk many different types of cancers\nAt the same rate as smoking two packs of cigarettes a day I I wrote that up and publish it Nineteen Seventy one everybody laughed at me well in two thousand Fifteen\nThe world Health Organization and set it and then just a couple of weeks ago there's big study in England\nWhere they ... they looked at like five hundred thousand people who are getting these processed meats and sure enough\nYou know men get breast cancer you know that's true you know Israel of\nWomen and of course it also had um a cause and effect or in a lung cancer colorectal cancer and stomach cancer and so on\nAbsolute fact and so I haven't them eat and processed meats for fifty years\nTalked I've got a a friend of mine who has been\nJust starting the regimen a ... a little late and let me tell you why\nShe went to the doctor a couple of months ago and the diagnosed her with the uterine cancer okay uh they're I guess they're going to give her full hysterectomy she's all upset but a ... ... what do you do at this stage\n... has it metastasized another word has left the uterus and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that kind of I don't think so\nOkay well I'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer chemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but it also kills normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died and they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer\nOr the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late and it's so sorry that we weren't able to stop the cancer invariably it was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that killed the patients at the cancer and so that's a a problematic thing\nA with a trading with chemotherapy but it's everybody's choice are they going to get that are now the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend\nWhen you have any type of cancer any type of cancer and so ... uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer brain cancer I mean we could we could have saved\nJohn McCain if he had come to us okay ah he had a brain cancer\nOther that actually caused by deficiency of a single mineral and I'm a ... and so but they gave him chemotherapy instead of giving him the nutrients\nAnd and and it is it okay to do both well many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would God Forbid I mean I'm not I would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases uh but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do if I had my doubts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have and probably probably two dozen antioxidant product that would take them all but um there's two of them are one of which was done in a big study I'm In I'm uh\nA hundred and twenty million dollar study was the government's study and um it's it's on our mosque a dime grape seed extract has a liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division and it's probably shouldn't treat journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective\nUm cancer which I say survival uh uh products and so liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight and um there's nothing like it out there and that so they're they're just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar government study\nMedical school in Charlotte North Carolina publishing the tree medical journals it's her liquid extract of from the market on grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have we call her Rosie radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan\nUnder the radical it or has the few Clayton which is an extract from red green algae that they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this\nRed marine algae as part of the sushi stuff as part of their standard that [noise] and so we have a product called Z radical and few cards either capsules and the radical the liquid\nAnd so I take that and of course I take the most 'cause I ain't grape seed have sold and I take the must get angry seat liquid just for prevention I keep my immune system a top and I don't eat processed meats\nAnd um and and so you get your body than Ninety ascension your chance to sixteen minerals sixteen vitamins from is a very petty officer your body functions probably including your immune system\nAnd you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up you live longer you are able to fend off and avoid so many diseases\nBecause most of the ones that used to be said to be a genetic it really just simple

wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so\nSuddenly concert why should they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so it's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they\nWrite a lead of a story they write in an intro they have to do who what when where and why and how and and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nStory includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I wanted to be rich\nAnd you know they don't really want to be rich what they want\nIs usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is they don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so what you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is it\nWell you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want and\nThe other thing I notice George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like um I had one group one master class a intention group of eight\nAnd they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery and I said to them why what do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child and Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for me individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you\nYou know so it's it's really about\nFirst of all figuring out what you want\nExactly and then telling\n... yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with Lou Mick Jagger in about intention let's start by going to Thomas a mobile you California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb that's really a pleasure of comment and then a question um I was just\nYou know your audio lecture programs one called living the field and the other one called living with\nAnd tension and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that they're just have so much information now unique unique about\nRetro causality retro in ... and you cite a number of experiments that appear to prove that\nWe can not only in ... for the president but weekend and tanned for the past that the past is not fixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be wrong bust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite ... how much met a job up here a group and Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop semi just random retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention one I tend to do though is\nYou can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is change your response to it and going forward and in a way that is\nPart of this whole thing of time being really elastic time be one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um\nWe don't change the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show but just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nTo moment in their health just when something\nJust started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were\nTerrible at some things we just just did something like that\nAnd go back and change your response\nTo that teacher and you say no I'm not used to sit math I just don't understand is now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine that that\nHealing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you sheets\nImagine that time and I swear to you she told us her skin was starting to re pigment in the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something and it's in his sense released it for them going forward so it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with retro intention because even\nScattered physicists now are saying to us all um\nYou know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here a rich go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yes it can you hear me don't carry a speaker phone all the good pretty good\nOkay 'cause it's kind of hard to hear you I Want to thank you and when I'm your conversation is so right on it's almost like you have all the time let me give you a a thing um I grew up kind of Catholic\nI heard the

I think it was the\nProbably that so many instances killings and I think that it was really shocking to me that\nIt wasn't just health that was healing because you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that um but for instance\nNatalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of a group and she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous in all ways\nAnd and she and her husband had a computer support in business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that\nOne of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere\nAnd they were really worried because they had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about a decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive so she can't\nDuring the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark opening up their car doors and money spilling out\nAnd afterward her feeling about it for fear and their depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of certain offers she paints is a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training full program that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of aid group\nNot only perform magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity and I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything and people's lives begin to heal\nAnd you do develop intention in your dreams they\n[laughter] that's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know were intending somebody calls a dreams R B roll you know we got weird weird stuff going on there and dreams thought they are\nOften times ... cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow\nI was really interested to find that that\nUm a lot of people a lot of people ... dreamed that nine eleven\nI'm a ... tax um Rupert\nKilled raped did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of\nPlanes going into buildings that has a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank and\nSomehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time it's not beyond the\nRealm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happen we're thinking about it the key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his ...\nBreak we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain\nAnd I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of aid group together because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill\nThe pain in your

I guess we're going to give her full hysterectomy she's all upset but ... what do you do at this stage\nOkay has it metastasized another words has left the uterus and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that\nKind of I don't think so okay well\nI'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer chemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but it also kills normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died and they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer\nOr the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late news so sorry that we weren't able to to stop the cancer that invariably it was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells that killed the patient is not the cancer and so that's a problematic thing\nWith a trading with chemotherapy those everybody's choice where they're going to get that are now I ... the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend\nWhen you have any type of cancer any type of cancer and so was uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate cancer colorectal cancer stomach cancer lung cancer brain cancer I mean we could we could have saved\nJohn McCain of you to come to us okay ah he had a brain cancer\nOthers actually caused by a deficiency of a single mineral\nAnd I'm a ... and so but they gave him chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nAnd and it is it okay to do both well many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases um but I Love natural things in all kids but I probably would do if I had my doubts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have and probably probably two dozen antioxidant product that would take them all but um there's two of them are one of which was a big study I'm In I'm a Charlotte North Carolina I'm In the medical school\nAnd it was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was a government study and um it's it's on our mosque dined grape seed extract has a liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division\nAnd its publishing three journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective\nUm cancer which I say survival uh uh products and so liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight and um there's nothing like it out there and that so they they were just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar government study\nMedical school in Charlotte North Carolina published in the medical journals it's liquid extract of of from the mosque design grape seed and it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have a caller is the radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan\nOn the radical it or has the a few quite in which is an extract from red marine algae that they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this red marine allergy is part of the sushi\nSort of any other nation because they eat so much of this red green algae as part of the sushi stuff as part of their standard that [noise] and so we have a product called the radical and few causes either capsules and the radical the liquid\nAnd so I take that and of course I take the Mustang grape seed have sold and they take the Mustang grape seed liquid just for prevention keep my immune system a top and I don't eat processed meats\nAnd um and so you get your body than Ninety ascension your chance to sixteen minerals sixteen vitamins for him as a pet is your body functions probably including your immune system\nAnd you're going to do very well um your quality of life goes up you live longer you are able to fend off it avoids so many diseases\nBecause most of the ones that used to be said to be a genetic it really just simple nutritional deficiency disease is and that's why it might faces charges in the Smithsonian Institute of national treasure and sells for twenty five thousand dollars\nEach mission in young jeopardy the company behind critical Health News dot com is entering the cannabis markets are you in a big way right now we're ...

these people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it\nAnd that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the frenzy ah has gotten to a point knew that and I was talking to folks and yesterday who were in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy uh\nBoth assassinated and they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\n\nYeah I think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a we had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed a and it was a very bitter very divisive time\nUh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while\nAnd uh now we're drifting back up because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said it wasn't and actors that shot somebody will because she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like justice cabin on\nIts because we want to return to hey constitutionally based court system that uses the American system as a model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result\nIf your a left wing a Democrat we we we are at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now the American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously good or blow for the\nUh people who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you've got\nAnd he'll or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution

politics a red wave ain't going to happen\nIt's just a question of how big the blue wave is they could be a Saddam a it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought well maybe right but it probably\nIsn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just one hey you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic ah and we won for the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOf how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee and Arizona's now head or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points in his in ah\nTennessee as people to realize that Britain is actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you can get to a government run health system branch and starting to fall apart and Tennessee is going to end up affecting republic I'm I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races and some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching\nIs the\nGillum versus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for some many of watch the growth of Florida and\nHow well it's been a run by Rick Scott an end to the idea of turning that state over as critical as that said in the country electoral politics\nTo a guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen\nThen yeah he's got millions and millions and\nIt's just that just cannot happen then yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean Gillum is uh the latest great hope because you came out of nowhere as radical Democrat or he won an upset victory or ... temporarily looks very good\nI think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but uh but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the

course ah you know bills of books are among the best selling books of all time and literature and history a bill I Want to talk about what you see because you're one of the smartest political analysts out there with all your experience reporting\nIt's you know one of the smartest political analysts out there with all your experience and reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse than um you expected and are we approaching perhaps the Nineteen sixty eight\nStyle a type of frenzy in the streets\nWere bought or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career and you have basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement ever seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have guys like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do [noise]\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabinet hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner these these aren't accidents All right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it it gives this huge money behind it but they don't now instead they pro mold it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling\nOf this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been healthful has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nThe way I just laid it out to you and your listeners are just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness look whenever you have organizations\nThat are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change our it and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money he'd radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake and the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous oh this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's not what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods and ... and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged\nAnd the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about them\nThat was more of a fear thing than a than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause that George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle because I ...\nIt's getting into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all on the one girl lying by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now new two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm\nAll right and and I saw things\nLeveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to ... make a decision alright the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got capital they almost got him and this is a kind of country what\nIs is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a that President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to our roads basic rights like presumption of innocence you have to process what you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say no matter\nThe presumption of innocence if somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty\nBecause in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and habitat\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think bill I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am I Am petrified of this I ... I completely agree with you and I was slammed the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truce\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the to the curb denounced um put upon across crucified lose a promotion\nThis was going to stop that 'cause I got to have it anybody well and it how it happened it happened to me at ... obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you do to get a regulation that way\n\nThere isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess when

Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ratio and here's how it works with the rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so rates go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nAnd you know you wouldn't worry you know if you're a conservative Republican you were at the Democrats came out and for strong national defense and tax cuts\nAnd morality at home and on the streets and law and order and and basically came out with the same position says Republican that because they make themselves competitive with the Republicans and that'll get down to who's better it\nDelivering these things a lot of people still believe that Democrats are better managing government than the than the Republicans are so but at the Democratic party was going on direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing a reelection of a of a ... two thousand won it by making themselves\nSo marginal so crazy so\nUh you know out there that they just are revolting to most\nYou know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\nThe for the the chief law enforcement officer advocates filed its ... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence or Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your your beliefs are so\nPeople who want to destroy your your beliefs huh so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential documents I don't know she liked it on our side over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the ... let me give you an historical analogy if I may please\nIs that in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges caps is worth claim a radical up being funded by the KGB and she argued which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more ... more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominated George McGovern was a lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon and Nineteen Seventy two so so the Democrats\nSwore that weren't going to happen again so they they took control of the party and nominated a centrist Jimmy Carter and won the Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time defeating in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because as mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two\nNo I think social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taken power this is part of the reason why\nThe leftist so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post is a set joke itself let's face it the New York times is set joke CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lowering them show and the Fox news and to a ... you know Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite there were telling\nTheir marginal viewers Marshall readers marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more common placid\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear\nCalm and the storm don't you agree with that and\nYeah I Well Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really alternative change it or what but but one thing they do believe\nIs is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than Brock a bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would've done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can improve North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fish but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo don't go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer hum so many great books how Reagan dealt with the personally riots and will will play a bit of sound as if you missed the show last night let's all\nThose people who do four days in advance that if the university's sought to go ahead with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university here in many negotiate what ... what is\nThe season public institution that's right in the universe its own community in the community in Berkeley the live around all\nOf it began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they had the right to choose the law they obey as long as they were doing and the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction even talking about\nThere there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they laugh wanted to uh build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam you know the north Viet Cong soldiers satisfaction was completely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler thumb and the ... which is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was\nHe said warmly ruthless and if you listen to Iraq and he says these professors some of your old enough an audit no better you know the way he just\nDismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so you know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing and I I\nIt just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or their emotions\nCan justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... that it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal movement in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of law is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up what Webster I tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a just a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political upheaval but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary [laughter]\nYeah I agree with the mob wanted the Tea Party when they're dressed in period garb yeah and that's\nWhere the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they\nThey're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberals had a protest they must be one of the same no they're not one of the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough\nRight as long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well if you if you want to want to stand up for women in algae BT and then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat I was\nYeah but but that maybe I've said this before in the Sean I beg your part of a hat but the difference today between moderate conservative leader Laurent certain politician and the modern liberal politician is the liberal politician\nGoes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it but a moderate conservative ... that's an emotional response because because liberals going to do with the good things for you moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power\nSo I may give it back to you have to think about\nIt you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration of comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be in the first place\nWell again power power to the people in the ... tried to walk that slogan but they never really ... but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the republic\nNo power to the people stays with them not some some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a crank I Want to play one more thing fee

the light at the London ideas a size at trying to do good and trying to be said that what we have to look at is how this is ... in practice we are seeing a rising\nAnd ... is in play and I tell us having them from the\nFrom the activists who are drawing on these ideas which has come out says as the series I Believe\nThat these this is a small part of the population that it is drawing in more or less\nBecause they kind of think otherwise and some of these ideas because the ideals that\nThe idea that that women of color and they should have the same rights as everybody else is on the line with and they said was a good a lot of black people any ship it back to think what will how\nBad can they say if they had the thing is it is a problem because it is they may have actually it is supremely ended up for it is taking us away from the progress that we made and they gave us a liberal and advance\nThe civil rights movement and an equal pay for women that they can write they should find is that fair to say except for continuing that it's it's really getting something quite different [noise]\nSo I I I Want to continue our conversation I'm On this and the and the notion that year here it's a race to the bottom you with the intersection analogy you are\nYou're flipping the pyramid just upside down but it is still a pyramid um\nWhere the the one who has a the most uh you know points you know I guess in their favor of I've been abused with this this and this and buy these groups in this group and this group\nThat they become the power um it it sounds like it's it's just not just the construction idiots constructing something that is the ... in nature\nI and I'm In London and then and we can do quite well with this they said yeah ... ... that as quite right just as difficult to the well to say than it is quite than\nIt is quite excited that you go to Chinatown and you can trace it said if there were also yes some and 'cause it'll probably with a lack of and relations with with some great write books\nDid that and it is it is pets today to add to it like\nYeah the ... side I see a lot of based on the liberal side too and I I think on the far left his and mistake\nAlike in one's own traditions and culture and as a hatred for everybody else's and as a form of racism and all that she can nice and some pretty um\nBasic thing call and you do any of the ...\nSo we just spend a couple of minutes on a on what you guys did I'm a ... you were to try to get nonsense published in peer reviewed uh and uh and you and you you know you were hoping maybe to get one but you had seven in a year\nAnd some of the topics were insane\nWhich one where you are responsible for\nWell I I took part in all of them I I listen I took the lead\nOn on one which one could win the jokes on you which is a bit shaky but [noise] and\nI'll get that that there is not acceptable way to criticize a social justice scholarship and activism and that anybody who mock potato or did a ... or ... academic hoax of it was trying to present them and and the privilege\nAnd that one was accepted quite quicksand and was apparently a as an accident a contribution\nTo [laughter] so but you don't you you you guys found out that you couldn't just published nonsense exactly yeah that's a point to the\nRight you you you you actually had\nTo um join in on the on the grievance club is that is that accurate\nYeah see you really have to understand and navigate a complex arrangement of\nOf rules so it is that we couldn't say anything that was was crazy but we had to stay there recently within ... than this developing body as Siri say sometimes yes we take a a mad idea like I'm at I'm willing to Tom Paine among the ...\nThe whole training humans they men like dogs and\nThen we'd have to find some way to make this to the theory and in that case we looked at San assumptions about implicit bias and claimed that we could read it in humans in their interactions with dogs and that was that the hook\nThat enabled us to build and I love to see a way to support this this plane and for it to be accepted and then on that does exemplary scholarship\nI Believe ... what was what was the um you took Adolf Hitler as mine calm and and how much of that tax did you believe in and what did you change\nBut that is quite that's quite difficult to explain and James took to the late on that one so I'm not entirely clear on what to do and okay anyway thoughts\nThe important things when if you if you read it through you would not immediately think they sounds just like Hitler you know it has been changed it to intersection of salmon isn't that the point of that one was really to to draw on the\nAnd the greens and it's and the totalitarian kind of feel all that\nBut also we wanted to say you wanted to prove that we could make fairly thick absolutely anything if we just both in enough different\nThings that said that one is incredibly complicated bringing in theory from all over the place but in the end it it it builds up to two yes to to make that kind of we must all them together in the right thing that gets to come and that's a common enemy and the narrative was\n... when this came out uh and uh I mean I Would think that this would be something that you know the uh the the\nThe world would you travel in would be outraged that those things were accepted a and you would you would be viewed as a whistle blower\nHey wait a minute we've got a problem you got have you have you had any response like that from your peers\nSurprisingly yes we we have a\nSon yeah when we were delighted for example that and the judges which is often an extremely critical of criticism this\nAnd that is another and to sit and sort of academic academics left isn't actually came down on our side and said at remained quite neutral and the size of a sudden nine for Iran said yeah\nThe whole city on charitable [laughter]\nUh you know he was saying anything with an English accent it's like a it's like a uh it's it's it's like here in the Carolinas if you've ever come down in the Carolinas bill said horrible things but they'll follow it with this\nThey'll say horrible things but they'll follow it with this tone of you just want some sweet tea but they're telling you to leave a and I think you have the same language just have the same the same charm a it was a quite distasteful um [laughter]\nWe have to stay\nA little bit a little bit um a Helen thank you so much and we would I Would love to fly you in a from London in and sit down and and uh and spend a couple of hours with you and and even your cohorts are at some point I I find you fascinating and refreshing and\nThank you for having the courage to speak out and explain things to you know the rest of us slumps\n[laughter] if I can

I didn't want to give you an update\nSome of our partners for mercury one are already there somebody somebody cares setting up a pod hot meals station in Panama City beach\nAh they already have that

NAFTA to point out type of situation\nWell that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nThis is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy Larry Kudlow so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum because you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but\nWe've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produced I was all over it and how is your Bush\nA couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and judge that's going on around the country our auto producers are a lot of us are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point to chop is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to\nBecause the steel chairs so my point to proposition even creating factory jobs are going to lose factory jobs as a result of that so I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nDoes he look like these softening now do you think\nI don't see I don't see it either but I Do agree in response to that question isn't it [laughter] you know he's not yeah no and I I\n... at the rose garden last week he said how was he was ... boasting about how all the steel jobs were created it's true we are creating steel jobs Mr President but we're losing jobs we're losing you know jobs and up in other areas that manufacture equipment trucks that thing you know those kinds of things that ... ...\nIt's a it's a dumb policy I Wish you would reverse it and by the way the auto ... same thing in the U.S auto industry doesn't want the church you know that someone nature of their supplies Tom from you know a country's abroad you know this\nWas manufactured you know ... steel might have come from a you know\nCanada about the assembly might have come from Mexico the the parts might have come from Taiwan I mean it's just it's just a modern American\nA global economy at work and and we put our ourselves at risk here but at the end of the day I think Trump is going to prevail on China I think I'll make a production within six months I think China's gonna come hat in hand and make some real concessions to chew a Trump and die adult and if that happens that you're going to see the biggest market below me ever saw\nEven more thanks so much good to talk to my friends say Hi to Larry how's he feeling how's Larry Kudlow has\nThe picture out and he's even stop

I mean this stuff goes away fast and I think there were I don't think this is because because it's not just Kavanaugh if they would've yeah left\nIt alone leclaire Williams but they're not they're doubling down Hillary Clinton yesterday we can't\nLive with these people I'm a Eric Holder comes out that the news today that he says\nWhen when they go low we kick them and the crowd cheers and this and he followed it with this is ...\nAnd the crowd cheers and ... and ... with this is who the new Democratic Party\nIs amazing amazing Michelle Obama pushed back on that today by the way kind of an interesting way\nUm but you know what you see I think is if you are under control you can make these stories go away their craziness in the cabinet thing could probably be forgotten by a lot of voters if you look at it from the time that Donald Trump came down to the escalator to today probably his cleanest month\nWas October two thousand sixteen after that that a tape came out he was buttoned up for the rest of that\nTime and made very few statements and wound up winning the election um because people were able to kind of forget about you know sort of craziness and scandals that were going on and look more Hillary Clinton enters craziness and scandals\nUm so if you look at this ... they ... they could get it to go away doing things like we're going to kick them when they're when they go low a and a few people saying that's not a mob what are you talking about that sort of stuff is not going to help them no ... and so far since the Kavanaugh saying what we've seen is really\nEncouraging numbers for the GOP particularly in the Senate the Senate has a you know we had a lot of reasons we talked about the um Robert Francis overworked versus a Ted Cruz situation where Cruz a that poll came out of fifty two forty three a nine point lead now Cruz had been\nThere was one poll I think that had them tied a few ... most of them settled around three or four points with cruise leading\nUm that's expanded in multiple polls now to a new ten point I used to be more than nine or ten point yeah to pat gray who are who are not in here with us today but he was talking on his show I think it was yesterday of the day before\nBelieves that it's going to be over ten points yeah I think it'll be I think it will be between fourteen an Eighteen points to another interesting poll that came out yesterday again from the New York times\nAnd this is you know they're doing his life pulling thing I mentioned uh last hour\nHow many calls as it takes to get seven hundred and Seventy eight responses in Texas how many calls you have to make to get seven hundred and Seventy eight people to talk on the phone to you the number\nFifty one thousand one hundred and Ninety to ... they had to call fifty one thousand people to get seven hundred and Seventy eight to actually participate in the poll which isn't good well you're calling Texas\nA and if it's marked with a New York's number more than New York times\nI understand that uh I mean it's this is ... overall like for example York they did they also polled the eastern Long Island district New York one\nAre and what they found a five hundred and two responses they had to make twenty seven thousand one hundred and Seventy ... or you answer in seriously you know anybody that would take the time to answer that nobody does and I wouldn't ... again if you take into account that factor which is totally changed with the last Twenty years with cell phones and and uh telemarketers and all those things it's\nAmazing these guys get even close to accurate results from polls because your self selecting a group of people who want to participate him and it's you know who knows if they're represented\nWhy Google Home should include some sort of an F MRI so they can just read our brains you that that would make it a lot of it would make it a lot easier\nTo come to your door that yeah I wanted to um another interesting poll that came out of there are times though however a was a protest of the Taylor Swift effect remembered Taylor Swift after all these are all the time being silent on on politics decided to dive into it inexplicably they\nRidiculously fuller again like you almost feel like with her PR team if you're going to come out and do this at least have like sensible observations and don't be just a bumper sticker you know a ... you know\nQuote tweeting Huffington Post write like that was the level of analysis she provided in her little post but again she's one of the biggest celebrities in the world how did this happen\nI she's from Tennessee she came out in Tennessee raised the biggest thing that she talked about what Marsha Blackburn saying how anti women she was and and how she didn't care about the she wanted to keep gaze at stores and all these ridiculous things that aren't true um well the first ... come out since that\nUm and ... ... ... uh\nOf the ... ... calls were uh after that\nFifty four to forty Blackburn leads fourteen points this was a race that was in the top category now that polling holds I can think we could fit a safely or understand that more people care about what Kanye West thinks about politics than Taylor Swift but we'll see if that holds or not\nSo we could look at\nSenate possibly a red wave in the Senate yeah I think you know so we talked about this a little while ago to which makes sense people know that's where the Supreme Court is happening and also people are in red states right and they're going to become more excited to vote more passionate about voting\nThe the the house we're seeing sort of a a slight turned to the opposite effect wear purple districts um sometimes it has been around a little bit Lou a little more blue\nNot much to tell from it I think all ready to houses in real real danger I mean I it would be a surprise at this point if the Republicans were able to pull out the house not impossible it would be a surprise um uh but for the Senate real quick\nIt would be a surprise um uh but for the Senate real quick\nWe had ten tossup races that we were talking about before um and I believe it was three or four that the ... the Republicans had to win to control the Senate I think it was three that with three of the tent at the time we talked about it but Ted Cruz race which in which he was favored by only three points with the best\nCase after case right now that's changed dramatically since we talked about that a couple of weeks ago\nI'm a Ted Cruz seems to be on solid ground uh and more than a three point lead\nA Heidi Heitkamp seems to be in massive danger I Would say it looks like two races were decided with the Kavanaugh hearings barring some other may major development ah Heidi Heitkamp voted against him she looks like she's toast and Arthur in North Dakota now a Joe Manchin voted for having all he looks like he's safe\nSo those two races are not even in the ... category anymore in my mind\nOr that we need to really has to cruise one which gets you down to about seven toss ups\nWhich the Republicans need to win one\nOne of the seven will keep the Senate in Republican hands is is much improved situation from even when it was just a couple of weeks ago the cabinet I think I think is a big part of it or we don't know that for sure yet I think I Will play out in the next week or so when we really have a lot of results but it looks very promising in the Senate better than it looks probably all year\nOr so that's a that's a good thing if you care about that\n... let me let me explain something this election\nCould being that I Know I Know technically we have three branches of government but I Believe we kind of had five we have\nThe press and the people okay by the executive legislative um and a judicial are the three in the constitution then you have the fourth which is the press\nAnd the people I Believe what happens in this election could put all five branches into chaos\nIf they win the house the house will go nuts\nAnd they will impeach they will subpoena which those subpoenas we'll go to the Senate the Senate will be in chaos because of it because of the Democrats\nThey will put the administrative in chaos because it will be under impeachment and it will also ah have testimony that it has to give that it will fight they're going to subpoena his tax records he will fight that which will go into the Supreme Court\nWhich the people will rise up and destabilize the fifth branch if you will the people they stand up and they're starting to fight kind of back and forth in the streets you know not in a mob sort of way just in in ... sort of way\nThey will the house will then again I think tried to impeach Kavanaugh\nOr at least get him to recuse himself from anything having to do with the administration you watch\nIt all in the end of the press is already in chaos\nAll every piece of society could be in chaos based on this election\nIt's going to be a fun couple of years I mean von ... thanks so we don't uh give us a quick report maybe every day here as things start to change yeah ah and ah give us a look on on the

M. K. triple the whole\nPoint it's Thursday which Don Wagner so you're in the studio we're going to talk about a medicine or health care elements well why don't you call us and tell us where it hurts on you and king and the golden valley nine to eight seven five three twelve thirty in Bullhead city Laughlin\nFormal holiday Mojave valley of needles or to nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety\nAnd the toll free as one aide for four to one nine twelve fifty for anyone and everyone anywhere I Believe last week did\nWe stop on supplements while we were talking about supplements we didn't get very far into them that's what I Want to pick up with so we did talk about\nVitamin B. twelve and vitamin D I think we talked a little bit about calcium as well mhm so we covered those and there's a couple of more and more to talk about with just touched on it because there's so much content here there is alive and it's very confusing for most folks because there's a lot of information out there most of which are much of\nWhich is not valid information it's it's it's advertisements right it's it's propaganda because the supplement companies don't have to provide the burden of proof that their supplements meet any specific\nCriteria like pharmaceuticals for entertainment purposes only and that's one that is really one way of looking\nAt it um you know you spend a lot of money on these there's not a lot of studies and a lot of these medicate a lot of these supplements um we really don't know how much of the the active ingredient is inside right uh because again they don't have to meet that\nBurden of proof that there are some supplements that are ... to me\nThat you know they don't have to but they do meet it in and the way you can tell is is by looking on the label and it says us pie or us form of ... which tells you that they they need a certain standard and so at least\nYou know so it's sort of like underwriters laboratories for electronics\nSomething like that there's this is a little more safety to it but you can you can rely upon if it says it has so many milligrams of micrograms of that there is it's probably\nUm you know most of us take multi vitamins we take supplements because we think that we're not eating enough for\nHealthy foods were not getting the the the vitamins and minerals that we need and most of us know where we have bad died you know they they we know we're going from one fast food establishment to another I mean\nIt doesn't take a genius to understand that that's not going to give you what you need so so the thought is well maybe I'll just take a multivitamin and multi vitamin companies have really kind of made you believe that\nAnd there's really no truth to that unfortunately you know if you're not getting it in your food taking a multi vitamin D is not necessarily going to replace it in in the quantities or\nOr even the the whole complex that you need or the body\nTo do something with it so it's oftentimes a waste of your money ... you know if you have a ... we've measured how below be twelve or low the six or something like that\nAnd we replace it that makes sense right yeah um you know but we talked about the twelve and that's one of those that we we really no matter what we do even if you're eating a whole or if you're reading a good balanced meal and you're eating the standard American diet but you're getting enough vegetables\nYou may still not getting enough beach wealth because the cows are not eating their natural diet and so they're not necessarily forming the beach wells so you probably are very\nThat's that's one way that you don't have to take the fish oil supplements and then you know brought up the the fishy that's what a lot of people dislike about it um but there's a lot of you know there's a lot of controversy here about the long chain ... fatty acids and whether we're able to make enough of them when we eat the plants\nAnd as we age are and in certain disease states like diabetes or we don't make enough of that a lot of times we ... our diet\nThe problem is you know some of the things we getting our we eat them in like the fish you know they have other toxins in them and and and also there's a lot of saturated fat so were you know we run the risk of raising our cholesterol\nAnd a lot of people are taking the mega threes to lower their cholesterol so you know there's there's a lot of um\nYou know are you um ... opposite effect of what they're trying to get now what what we need to do is we need to talk about the ... and how they work you know how they work and it it it makes a little bit more sense to me that there aren't a lot of long term studies this is the problem of\n... that's the problem so we don't have\nA lot of of of studies to to look at to say okay this is what we know for sure\nAs fast down the vitamins and nutrients a sideline of all this stuff is a little knew where\nIt is and and I think science is going to catch up to it eventually again with the supplement companies they're they're they're making these fish will tablets they're not investing a lot of money and the research because they really don't feel they need to right they don't want to prove anything they want to sell you the product yeah their parents\nRight they don't want to prove anything they want to sell you the product you know their favorite it away from lamp oil um our here that are doing it for years a little different time [laughter] just this little\nUm but and one of the big problems is that we don't have any studies or or any proof that high doses of a mega three is safe or a and we don't know any levels that\nWe need you know it's not like you take so many milligrams and it gets you this effect\nThat it it's just doesn't work like that um and there's some evidence that as you increase the da ... supplements of da and actually um it it it will help to protect I help but if you're taking increased amounts of a LA which is the omega three\nThere's some evidence that it worse than or increases the chance of macular degeneration so so this is this a lot of conflicting information out there that really confuses people and even confuses doctors and so it's not clear do we\nHave more of the short chain ... fatty acids in or is it safe to take in more of a long chain ... fatty acids and if it is what form is the safest and that's you know we need a lot more research on that before we can conclude simply say this is the best path right\nBut what we what we know when you're seeing some of the research calming or bearing fruit in the medical world now because we have a couple of products uh prescribe vote products once called ... and one's called ...\nAnd these are prescription based uh omega three feet but a da Cheney PA tablets belongs in the long chain right exactly and and they're made by pharmaceutical companies they meet the u._s. peace so you know the level they tell you is there and the best part about it and not that I'm a\nBig fan of pharmaceutical companies because folks out there no I'm not\nBut when they do with a farm so pharmaceutical companies do work on these things they have to do studies right so we're getting studies now because\nThey have to do them are these the ones that are made out of the ah the algae base well they're they're both different I'm going to talk about that in a few minutes to us I'm One of them is made from fish sources that the um ... is is uh from fish or something I'll talk about that\nAnd then the other one is made they purify pure EPA which is really interesting and and they're showing some really interesting benefits will eat the recommendations and we can take that micro algae\nRight I'm going to take two hundred milligrams a day you know the recommendations are somewhere between two and three hundred milligrams is against there's no hard and fast rules is recommendations out there we don't know how to follow it so we can say okay we can check your level because we don't know what levels\nYou can check the level but we don't know what levels are good yeah right if they're really low we got as we can say you're deficient right but if they're somewhere in the middle of ... and we don't know what that means right until we got guidelines and I think that's going to come down\nIn time I I Hope I'm but you know you can if if you're willing to take you in a good diet and you're eating plant based diet you you want to choose three servings\nOf a hot and plant foods that are high and omega three and we're talking about [noise] flaxseed so quarter seats wound um you know and then oils like ham seat or walnut or canola oil or just eat half of a wall not which will give you enough\nUm to meet the daily thankless role another black walnut he doesn't matter [laughter] ...\nI'm as soybeans work a tofu works happy I mean there's a whole a whole host of ways you can get your a short changed fatty acids\nWhere you can make them a but again there's a lot of evidence that suggesting that within certain disease states and as we age we don't make enough enough of the long chain ... fatty acids so now\nYou may need to replace the long chains and and this is again not established\nUm there isn't yet they have no ... ... to to guide you so you don't know if you're overdoing it um so the recommendations currently or somewhere between oh anywhere between two Fifteen thousand milligrams that's a pretty wide range\nOf BPA again you can get it naturally which is probably the best way to least expensive\nOr you know in in ... maybe three three and a half ounces of omega three fatty fish you know like look macro tuna herring um and if you do that you know two times a week you get plenty of those long chain ... fatty acids you know you're getting other things that you maybe don't want like extra saturated fat\nOr some impurities like heavy metals right um if you like the canned fish maybe a little bit of salt more than ... you're going to get yeah you are going to get preserved you're absolutely right um but you're going to get plenty of your long chain ... fatty acids um\nThese these supplements that are out there now do you have a choice ... she's one of them right krill is another one I think it's called mega read is is a brand that there are a lot of people take it made for krill um and the arguments are that it's a little more\nKrill um and the arguments are that it's a little more palatable it doesn't give you that same fishy taste um\nYou know the fish is one way the krill is another way but I think the best way as if you're going to take a supplement go go for the algae\nIn much fewer ... uh of toxins I wouldn't even know where to start looking for that but what is it yeah it's I mean those fancy brand names are those who actually say algae plus uh you know I did know the name 'em\nI wrote it down to and I don't have in front of me um it's\nA ... and when you go to the break I'll look for it but um yeah there is a brand\nThere's actually a couple of brands and you can Google you know micro algae are sources of long chain ... fatty acids in short team fatty acids and and then there's a couple of friends out there\nBut for those who want to Reagan variety actually be just a lung fatty acids it'll come up that way um but these these two pharmaceuticals\nAnd um [noise] and I'm\n... and it's not losing in\nUm well I'm One of the things is\nYou know we we know that if you take a high amounts of BPA these companies have shown us that it it it helped drop your triglycerides so it's a good thing the ha also can but the ha has been shown to raise your bad cholesterol so kind of our sets the good thing so they what they found is\nYou know the ha products\nOr not by themselves the best approach and in fact ... and that's\nOne of the issues of ... though is it's it's got omega three it's got omega six in it and it's got ... P H so it's got a whole mix of the problem is that you're getting more of the omega six you really want to avoid that because that's again the pro inflammatory\nOr short changed fatty acid which too much of that may lead you in you know to more of an inflammatory process so\nBut that's not fun exactly and some but but ...\nIs pure is purified BPA and what they're suggesting is because of that you don't have the downsides\nYou don't ... your lower the triglycerides you lower the LDL which is the bad cholesterol um and you lower the the risk of of heart disease and the best part is you don't have that fishy after taste\nSo when we and across the board I might have a spokesman for the pharmaceutical company but I've seen a lot of benefits from it if you're going to put your money into a supplement that's the kind of supplement that you should be taking but I again I moved back to go for the dietary approach get your kitchen nutrients in the food\nIs the best way and it's the best habit because once you start to get healthy dietary habits\nIt starts to change all of your lifestyle habits\nEspecially because of all the of shooting out what we call them the the ... structures in the whole food itself\nAs right so you need the whole complex is right and so you know the and that's what you're getting the food right you don't get that in the vitamin D the vitamin tends to be a synthetic form and they don't give you the full complex because they're really not worried about that they're just telling you here's your vitamin X Y Z whatever it is\nIn the liver I'm seeing it from a domino pain nausea vomiting I'm ... and and it very vague ... even some flu like symptoms you might have the upper abdominal pain when liberals cars to liberate mites and gorge a little bit um so\nIt's rare and I've seen it you know but I've I have had one patient they became hiring overloaded for plants alone so it's not impossible\nAnd if you're eating large amounts of it and you're you're eating it with things that free it up and make it absorbed quicker like the juice and cooking it just right and doing all the things I said then you might overload on it and I have had a patient do that who was trying to replace these are naturally and he overdid it or\nIn some instances it'd be trying to save money on flat try to make Kelvin eyes males I learned the hard way yeah I've been saying for two months [laughter]\nDon't recommend okay\nSo let's talk about something that's a good segue into zinc and zinc even worse there [laughter] I'll take it out here um but I think oh and and let me give you the wreck recommended daily allowance\nOf of iron I forgot to do that Eighteen milligrams a in in ... higher amount pre menopausal women because they're still having mentioned racing in Maine and post menopausal women only need\n... milligrams a day um and it's easy to get in in a serving of those green says it said broccoli kale collards ... I'm a and your favorite\nBrussel sprouts that needs to be sauteed I'm with no butter remember that some oil just no butter live we can use a little slack soil okay and that will help the absorption too many people are limited to three as well um zinc\nElectra glide saying recommended daily allowance uh between eleven eleven milligrams ... eleven milligrams from an eight milligrams for women\nUm and it's important in about a hundred different ends of magic reactions um it's also important in in protein synthesis so making protein\nCell growth blood formation so it's it's fairly important um I've never seen a deficiency but it can occur in ... occasionally and young children especially if they're eating a macro by addict diet because a lot of the certain plant materials that macro\nMac robotic diet because a lot of the certain plant materials that macro by addict people he doesn't have a lot of thinking it so it might lead to poor growth in the child but again it's fairly rare and there's not a macro by addict diets have kind of fallen out of favor in the recent past so we're not seeing as much of that\nBut the absorption is again the issue you know the same with iron so we get plenty and the plants that were going to need even though the recommendation by the food nutrition board was\nSince we don't absorb it as well just like iron we vegetarians and begins needs to eat a little bit or taking a little bit more so instead of Lebanon for men milligrams they're recommending about sixteen and a half milligrams and for women instead of eight\nTwelve and aside from having a penny and a ... a\nGrading it over your salad what a good sources of thing so good sources of zinc are going to be\nBeans nuts seeds again broccoli one of my favorite mushrooms peas a lot of different beans having so it's it's really not hard to get think and again you don't need a lot of it and there's plenty in these foods to the issue is just how much were absorbing\nSo again the same thing applies you want to cook them to break up that fight hate so that you absorb more or put some vitamin C. on it so squeeze lemon juice on it\nUm don't drink coffee or tea with it because the tenants will affect that said you know maybe roast your roaster toast they're not treating that'll freed up a little bit don't take your calcium supplements while you're taking using so it freeze it up don't take calcium while you're eating your meal\nSprout your greens and your your beans and grains and and that will help you to absorb ... I don't even follow zinc levels I never have you know I and we do because again there's there's there is loss of of iron for different reasons and we do become mind division I'd never seen zinc efficiency\nAt all so it's it's so rare um we could you could have\nGot to be something else going grievance we wrong for it to show off their usually yeah and there's usually\nWhen you see is inked efficiency you're you're usually talking about somebody who has rapid cell turnover so maybe who has someone who has cancer you know we're a very young child again rapid cell turnover where they're growing and they're just not taking enough you know with a person with cancer maybe they can't take enough because\nThe cancer is you know just ... you have pretty much doing it's due diligence you know and destroying you and and you know you're wasting in and then the other thing is that you know if you if you're sick with cancer maybe you're not getting enough nutrients to offset that you know because you can't you can't consume them you're sick maybe from\nThe chemotherapy or whatever else so so um those again rare very rare cases\nAnd we got about a two and a half minutes where you get into for the last segment\nSo I'm more of for the last segment you went to which we started getting into now and finish what we're gonna we're gonna do\nWe're talking about iodine for John okay yeah 'cause I promised I Would ... we can talk about vitamin a maybe vitamin K I had a request a from a listener to talk about vitamin B Seventeen which is an interesting one most people don't know what that is\nThat is you know I Love although I I'm sure we all know the uh the vitamin K mess up the carrots or during World War two and\nA blitz dime London since I didn't want to reveal their radar technology the honor carrots full of vitamin K and makes you eat better at night [noise] not entirely the truth right that's right but our ... our carrots a good source they might even gay\nI'm no I'm not have a high they have very high on ... [laughter] well no but it was but it it's the Caribbean the beta carotene that she made him we'll talk about the vitamin hey that really was good for the eyesight so there is benefit there it's just for a different reason was vitamin K\nAll right as far as vitamin a and one of the skates and they completely I Can't recall what it was a that one base and\nWe'll we'll vitamin a ... from Clinton sources the crowd noise so you know beta carotene alpha carotene I mean all the orange red yellow a um plants will have a lot of the carrot ...\nSomeone's I'd like to put up on the wall at the grocery store and those big pictures are just so fun to look out all the colors\nAnd they're pretty mhm that's right All right then\nWe will get on with the those vitamins when we come back here on live and local in the afternoon on the rise states number one news talk am FM radio leaders K triple A.

she won this gene is the only way they for me at all\nGreat pitching will stop you from having\nAlmost small thing it'll come down to that that's the difference between moving on\nMaybe winning a World Series you say Robert de ... manager you guys you rely on the long ball as well are you worried that your true self reliant on the whole month and\nDo walk a lot more of a way to walk a lot that I think a lot of the data don't want you to get guys\nThis is Dan ... welcome to the program it's our one on this Thursday Dan and that in it stands Patrick show Peter King from NBC Sports will get ready for eagles giants coming up tonight also\nHumor for at least for the Shanghai Sharks former BYU storm had a chance a couple of opportunities in the NBA and getting ready to turn thirty foot up forty shots against the rockets the other night we'll talk to him about that experience Jim referred to add a little bit later on\nAnd we'll check in with the Minnesota Jimmer ... where there were only this entertaining when they play basketball [laughter] like get in touch with the program you can ... question\nGot us out of the day play of the day all of that coming up eight seven seven three D. P. show email address dictated to I'm Patrick dot com say good morning to our radio and TV partners direct TV the audience network\nThat's channel two thirty nine and the NBC Sports network and our three hundred and thirty six radio affiliates around the country but yet to see each holds a special place amongst NFL divisions because they have for the foundation franchises or the league\nAnd this isn't a case of east coast bias because the most famous team in the division isn't even in the east it's the Dallas Cowboys day of America's Team the defending champion eagles are also in the division two time Super Bowl champion quarterback in the giants Eli Manning and some promising talent in Washington\nBut the ... aged always gets a little extra attention and this year getting a little extra attention they can avoid avoid it this time because they're not very good at all for teams have a negative point differential on the season\nNone of them have looked like potential playoff teams and tonight you have the eagles and the giants facing off of the mental ... and I would normally say well you got a must win situation for both of these teams\nBut in this division I don't know if it's a must win situation if say we certainly like to have a victory\nYou got the email back and junior controversy off the field poor effort by the team on the field the woman for ... out of it by any means if they beat the eagles tonight they're right back\nIn the hunt somebody's gotta windows division right\nWe have a camera man who works on our staff who also has worked for Fox and his job during Giants' games on the sidelines he had a camera that was trained on O'Donnell back and junior that's all he did\nHe watched do Dale back him junior the entire game so whenever something happen\nHe had the camera on him and they were rolling on that and then they would bring that back that was his job and that'll be somebody job tonight for this game that will be on the sidelines with a camera on oh Dale back him junior no matter what happens good bad ugly\nBut that's the importance the power of all do back him junior and so when he sits down with a Josephine Anderson and low Wayne and has this heart\nTo heart and he's going to be honest and he's gonna tell you exactly how he feels about what's going on in New York and with his quarterback and with his coach he's not to be applauded\nBecause he was telling the truth ... kept it real no there's nothing wrong with keeping it real behind the scenes instead of hey let me tell you guys this and America this and then all of a sudden my quarterback and coach and she may have to respond to this\nI'm not sure why low Wayne was there because they have not gotten the interview if they didn't have a little way there\nI think the interview was originally supposed to be about tattoos or something like that and like and more like the entertainment side of things and then a Dell just unleashed with all this other stuff like out of nowhere\nBecause when I sit down with little way into CNN or so and that's when I get a real that's what I Want to tell you the truth about everything\nWe interact with them you only talk tattoos Idaho I did and Carter five I did talk about that but that was it and my little Wayne was in Rikers but that's it that's all I talked about this\nProgram has brought you by the great folks discover card they believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now\nJust for giving them and try to discover will give new card members of one year anniversary gift will never forget at the end of your first year they'll match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar no camps do catch is Trent believe it discover dot com slash match\nRight so the big game coming up tonight and a lot of drama here the eagles are they going to maybe upped the ante for lady on bell they gonna bring back\nThe Sean McCoy are all in if you're the eagles this year you know you win the super bowl\nHow badly do you ah want to add to that roster you've lost Jay ... for the season the offensive line has not been great defensive line has not been great in fact the eagles had not been great and even with cars and went back\nHow much do you want to go out and get a big time running back here how important is it for you this year\nI think that'll be one of the case also this is a story that's already circulating in New York that it's\nNow they're starting to say and this is the New York media\nColin Kaepernick\nDid you imagine I mean if you're going to have a circus it sure why not make it a big circus\nCome on in why not\nThe same bringing them in in weeks after week six yeah and he's going to learn the apparently apparently\nThat that's it it it feels like when all else fails there when you when you need somebody you just go Colin Kaepernick who hasn't played in a long time and you're going to bring him in and that's going to ... that'll solve everything you know\nIt's like the new Tim ... went to its\nWorks out in the league everybody I'm hearing rumors they might want to eat or to\nCome in [laughter] yes both in the giants can Wednesday night they face in Atlanta the Redskins up by week San Francisco Tampa Bay they could win for those\nI told you what's going to happen with the giants and I firmly believe this they're going to win five games in a row at some point that she said\nI don't know when but they will and then will say well is that enough for them to make the play offs oh where was that earlier in the year it just it just feels like that so Jayanti of them\nThe schedule helps them as well\nBut you know he lie manning in Oakdale back and junior you know they could have won the game against Carolina\nI'm now you got the eagles you should women escaped the vision a formidable eagles team and you're playing at home I Know it's a short work week but that should work to your advantage here it's just all the negativity that's attached to this game and his team and you wonder how do they get out from underneath this\nAnd you know it'll do audio back in June and says hey you know what I stand by what I said\nWell that's part of the problem too instead of saying you know what on second thought in respect to Eli who's won two Super Bowls and I haven't won anything maybe I should have said something to him privately you know maybe I shouldn't have said this publicly which leads me to Jimmy Butler\nJimmy Butler goes off yesterday during practice\nAnd he's a yelling at teammates she yelled at somebody in the front office you bleeping need me here and so Jimmy Butler I guess now has the leverage because he thought he had leverage wanted a trade and then Tom ... said we're not trading you I Want you to hear\nThe owner and talked about trading him and then you know they said no I Want you here\nSo then he lost his leverage now he goes off during practice conveniently sits down with Rachel Nichols and then he's gonna be she's going to be honest she's going to tell you the truth about everything that's going on\nOr are they going to get locked into a top five draft pick so we'll talk to Peter King about tonight's game also Tom Brady has some comments about what the NFL has become a shocker we've seen this coming for about a decade now\nThe style of often says he didn't say it was big twelve foot ball but he might as well just said we're playing big twelve football and coincidentally\nHe goes against Patrick homes and a camp city on Sunday

talking about a pro football and this was on his weekly appearance on the Boston radio station W E oh I and a here's don't\nThink now I think in some ways it's pro football's more glorified college football maybe at the transition that the more similar game than what it used to be yeah when I first started so much in football now is removing some of the physical element of the game it's just it's more of a space game and you know you see a lot of\nKind of college plays you know more and the pro game now than than what I remember when I started ... you know that's just kind of how things that went over the last ... years yeah I don't know\nIt's like big twelve foot ball in my opinion it's hard to play defense\nIt to all the benefit the office and we're seeing this explosion of often

make of Tom Brady his comments therapy\n[noise] all day and I think it's been a I think this has been a um [noise] you're right his here has really been the sort a pivot point for what's happening in football\nAnd it's why I think the NFL really has to be careful because in my opinion uh I think I think when you when you make rules Terry McCauley told me this now the new NBC rules analysts than I think he's the hit the nail on the head\nWhen you make a rule you've got to make sure that it does in a you know it doesn't put the balance way over the top to either all fence or defense and I think in what they're doing right now I mean I was I'm In San Francisco right now is with your Staley yesterday the forty niners\nAnd even you know really it's a fear Iraq's has not getting over they're happy but Joe Staley you know the the twelve year offensive tackle for the niners basically said I don't like the way the game is going\nSo you even got respected all sense of guys saying look the

know that that's that's the sport that's the sport if you take too much of the teeth out of the sport it's going to be you're going to be the western athletic conference and I just think the NFL is
