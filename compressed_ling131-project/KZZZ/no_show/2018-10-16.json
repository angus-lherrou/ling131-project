state that on our country they're ready for governor it's got to put them first out of the special interests that meant a former\nDirector for ice and force but under the Obama administration called

was\nYou know I was down in southwest Georgia on Saturday back again this morning where we literally have are farmers at our families suffer from hurricane and you know that's what this race is about them about Jordan's versus about that our country first\nOr a head of those that are here illegally you know no no one has or sympathy for people and their their flights in their country but\nYou know we have to protect our own we have to have secure orders we cannot go to other countries can get free government healthcare we cannot go to other cultures and get you know free education I got three teenage daughter so you know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on artwork Jordan's to pay for it and people are tired of that are waking up and they're turning out we're going to put that ... but we need conservatives across the country to join the fight like others are doing to help her\nYou know drive the

twenty as oil\nCamp for governor dot com camp for governor dot com go to that website\nHelp out Ryan because he has American first on the brain which is where what we needed to be we need the

porous border and absurd immigration loophole that essentially results in catch and release which is what the president is so frustrated about uh Brian\nI have to play something that Stacey Abrams is a beating on pretty hard which is the claim of voter\nA beating on pretty hard which is the claim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration estate ah which of course can play both ways but ah we're gonna play this and get your reaction let's listen\nHere fifty three thousand people that are being forced to go through unnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide eat the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteering have poll workers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this this is the subject is ...\nIt would be much easier if he actually did his job and ... people in a proper fashion and we did not have the ... system\nUh your reaction to that uh the the law that script matching matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls\nThey claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell no this was a law but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for up barefoot case in process because we believe in we should do not support this that we should clarify who individuals are before registering to vote that's why we have a stick\nA citizenship check is why we have when you get your driver's license in our state ... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand fourteen reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we've had record turnout of Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that spoke suppression\nRight before this outrageous claim came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before the state of Georgia because we have things like online voter registration up push the general assembly and implemented as secretary of state ... years ago we have eight thousand more people on our roles now that we hit had when I\nTook office she voted against on line voter registration she does not support our common sense\nPhoto out the law she voted against our citizenship chit the counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because they have permission from hurt local groups\nIs not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license\nAnd they can vote so that is not a hot hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper pipe or register someone to vote\nAnd if they use our own line system they never had any of this problem to start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think\nGeorgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're

and other networks we were so top heavy on the show last night on the anger bank we didn't even have time to get into that we were so swamped with\nAll the immigration news and all the other stuff happening in the midterms in the party of victimhood angle do we have the party of victimhood angle on the Web site yes it's on lower income dot com and Facebook yes okay so you can watch

into the story Daniels but the judge ordered legal fees paid yeah I was thinking about this just as this uh\nUnfolded kind of last night if we're getting ready for the show\nThe plaintiffs bar in the United states the lawsuit mania Trump should talk about that too not just because of his own personal issue like if you're a well known person or if you run a business you run a store you know he's a slip and fall cases it is an\nOut that they feel like if we're more outrageous we do something that the more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a ... that\nAh because he really is in touch with people on immigration\nRight it's not a big issue let me give me some facts here before we get to our guests are the\nGallup poll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us voters was back in July\nOr twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and has the highest percentage naming at issue in Gallup history\nAnd asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question\nUh again mentions of immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only you know five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup it's an asking the question on generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd it goes on and on about this uh a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration is their biggest concern topping economic performance and healthcare immigration and the writers if so what is the top issue for voters in the election\nOf that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same uh but listen to this\nForty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because\nOf course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration then pretty much any politician alive today he understands that\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia fifth congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongress men I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nWell every time we passed the bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out very depressed and who wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use the term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explained to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance\nBecause essentially what they've done is that if you don't want to open borders but in your me ...\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand that very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and helped the legal immigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and an end and\nWhy is that the Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nWell let me tell you about something that happened Congress men it's just it's very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity to rein in these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear\nA category as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions\nAlong as attorney general and says ... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear Congress sadly David Yoder\nA congressman from Kansas and a a ... a democratic uh in uh North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took\nAccording to Harvard voted missions data or they reduced Asian American enrollment for forty three percent to Eighteen percent uh through a complicated ... a diverse if a ... scheme in fact Harvard zone admissions data shows that\nA an a turtle team who they were discriminated against Asian Americans and they bury the report that's on trial right now and uh one important point I Want to make your audience today is\nThat Harvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell I'm so they take all this money to have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student\nAnd still be a be you know swimming in money uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism type of racism or\nYou know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just ... more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it shows a huge impact on missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the\nTo um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nOr is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity as a founding American principle of course American founded on liberty not founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be spring court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I I kind of disappointed with one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out\nUCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great\nQuality of education you can have a great education just let people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair them because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and\nUh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well uh this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nI'm laughing is not about protecting he's married in ... by an anti civil rights activists named had were well white rights activists who was trying to bring down marrying someone writes actions in American society town home from Eli about him and go home to bring down\nSome of the nation that is actually designed to increase increase opportunities increase there are the better\nFor everyone in gun brazen Americans found\nA your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard costs like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nOr who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies\nThose people spoke at the Asian American coalition a for educations Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision and then you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this was going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have the Justice Department who is on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action uh so because we have this powerful ally who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and\nWhite people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nOr a ... there's probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level than to a court of appeals and ah if they determined that circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating ah we've got to get you on TV you got to come on TV with us soon\nA v J in them now his book almost black a true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this the ... it's\nTo be black or what do you think about this the the it's racial been counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society a and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others\nI instead of just respect for talent in individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up\nWhether or not you're for or against affirmative action it's still important to see how affirmative action has negatively impacted Asian

now my greatest tragedy on the planet but I don't want to go down the road of\nAn hour you and I just want to go into a deep depression if we keep doing\nThough I've been down so long it really is up to now over the fact is we've tried so hard to find these uh elephant protection groups to no avail no but more getting back to the elephants called the Republicans in the donkeys called the Democrats\nOr who is going to run against Donald Trump in an age of hysteria you've got hysterical characters out there who will characterize everything he does\nAs what it is not as I've said many times people are terrified to speak the truth or I guess I've got to tell you this just last week on my radio show I talked about a woman I met from Hungary at emigrate who should Michael\nPeople are more afraid in America right now to express their political opinions than they were in the Soviet Union I was stunned and I talked about it and then an article comes out today I sort of the Drudge Report\nAlong those lines that uh people are terrified to express any opinion about Islam any opinion\nAbout minorities even minorities are afraid to talk about things in the country today we're living with more fear than than during the Soviet Union here because of the political straight jackets that we can put in by the left\nAnd I think again the Republicans who are most fearful\nOf uh these issues on you know get back on their heels are on defense or they're the most ineffective Trump is really schooled everybody on how to fight me he'd singlehandedly I think he in in a Lindsey Graham turned around the cabin on your age\nLosing is doing great because he grew up with a pool is tough\nThese tougher than they appear yeah and I met him when I was in Washington of his or the

nine\nSometimes you get to feeling Aaron Rodgers\nIs bored he wants to challenge him so and I always thought this would bred for that for like degree of difficulty\nI don't know if that's the case with Aaron Rodgers but he does have a flair for the dramatic and last night the Packers entered as heavy favorites against the niners at home and they trailed laid looked like they were in deep trouble men Rogers took over\nThe lead to a game time Dr with less than two minutes ago got the ball back engineered a drive that resulted in a field goal and win against the San Francisco team playing with their backup quarterback\nNow Rogers still dealing with that any injury it's limited him all season long he's tried to get rid of that big brace that he's wearing in a year of incredible quarterback play he's probably still at the top of the league and now Green Bay faces some tough questions because it's one thing to struggle to put away the niners at home now you have\nThe rams and then the patriots you gotta buy week than ranching patriots and I'm not sure how far the Packers can go I get the feeling bacon either when the division or not make the playoffs\nThat shell sketchy it is right now when I watch this team I don't think the defense is very good I did like their draft those they went after some ... ... they're not\nAwful in this day and age I think you just have to be respectable don't just have a deep bench the\nBorders on being okay average good because the offices are so great but if there's any time left on the clock and Aaron Rodgers is still the quarterback anything can happen just asked the San Francisco forty niners but you're still get the it's odd feeling there with Rogers I Know he's not\nComfortable I don't know if he's happy at ... and maybe that's not a word you would attached to him but I just get the feeling there is something\nGoing on there friction going on there I don't think he likes Mike McCarthy's play calling at all but um you know here's Aaron Rodgers talking about the importance of last night's victory\nI don't know if it was a season Saturday when for us but it definitely um was important one especially with the uh prognosticators that'll go on about the ah typos opponent we have coming up\nThe next few weeks and obviously it on the road games ah this was a in foreign game for us our number like to use the term must win but ah it was important one\nRogers last I became the first player in NFL history to throw for four hundred yards and no interceptions it back to back games also doing it last week against the lines\nNow the four hundred yards doesn't mean anything to me because it feels like if you don't throw for three hundred you had a bad game\nSo the new three hundred four hundred yards but the ... interceptions that's the remarkable part of Aaron Rodgers because he does hold on to the ball a little bit shoot along in my opinion at times being an armchair quarterback by the way I'm undefeated as an armchair quarterback and like to be a rating is really high\nIt's almost perfect but Rogers is always trying to make a plus plays what they call it um\nAnd it feels like as you know he's what thirty for ... you just you're not going to be able to escape out of that too much longer and uh that was something I was watching last night you're just waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting and the fact that he's thrown known interceptions here's an interception\nTo touchdown ratio is probably going to be the best in NFL history of all the hall of famers I don't know if anybody's going to be close to what he's done yes but well\nKnow I think we did establish the Russell Wilson is the only one in his stratosphere right now these Russell's gotta ...\nRussell Wilson is the only one in his stratosphere right now these wrestlers got a great he didn't throw picks either\nYeah that's interesting yeah I'll check the style or because it feels like Rogers is always a little little bit more in control than Russell\nBut I think Rogers is already sealed the all time record he's way ahead ...\nAlright will come up with a poll question here are we a kiss off the NBA season you got a lot

Alice exactly three to one Rogers is four to one in Rogers has three hundred and twenty five touchdowns and only Seventy nine picks and it's pretty remarkable never thrown\nOver fourteen oh you've never throwing more than Thirteen picks entire season and in the past he hasn't thrown [laughter] it's on ten picked since he was twenty seven years old\nAnd he's getting better and how many interceptions is thrown this year one yeah twelve to one right now pretty impressive you qualities having a really impressive she soon as Philip Rivers\nBecause we've been caught up in Patrick ... homes now all of these quarterbacks I mean if you're if you're an above average a very good good elite quarterback you shouldn't be putting a big numbers here but I think Phillip Rivers has been really impressive\nNow they haven't played a great schedule you know their foreign to but they haven't played rates go join think everybody looking at the homes and how he started out the first three weeks but look at these numbers they're crazy and they're going to continue to be crazy\nBut Philip Rivers haven't onto the best season of his career so far I make love and you got a phone question

Theodore this is arguably my ticket growth favorite time of year I'll be the uh the NFL is kicked off their five or six weeks and you've got the baseball playoffs in full swing and opening night\nMy favorite obviously we talked about this is springtime because you've got you know the baseball players reporting to spring training and you've got the NBA getting ready for the playoffs so exciting time for the NBA Tonight\nThe number one question to be answered during the regular season for you is what\n[noise] which team is going to have the mental capacity really to knock off the champs I I look at\nAll thirty teams and there was a couple that come to mind obviously I'm seeing one of them tonight I think the Boston Celtics are tailor made now a lot has to happen so\nObviously a boring major injury to all these teams Brad Stevens and the Celtics to me\nAre probably the number one team that could probably go toe to toe with the Golden State warriors because of their debts their use their ability to switch to their defense um but a lot has to happen Kyrie have to stay healthy\nA lot of question marks on Gordon Hayward coming back from that major injury after game one last year\nBut those young guys driven brown teeth and pay them off the bench Terry rosier was fantastic uh the mores twins\nThese guys are built our corporate who's an all star they have so much death I think they're the one team that if they were able to get to the finals could really push the Golden State warriors\nWhat he's the one question you have about the Golden State warriors\nThat I Know what you're going to get it\nFrom there started five but after that I mean ... ... dollar who's ... who's a fantastic fix man but he's a year older they're going to be starting a Damien Jones the guy that really never played in the NBA and now he's getting his start with the world champs\nAnd how does boogie ... cousins who I Believe personally of going to have a fantastic here once he comes back and they're going to sell the land but what is going to be his role will accept his role I mean this is a one year deal\nAnd I'm sure he's auditioning for a much bigger contract either with the warriors or elsewhere um but their death and but that was a question mark last year and they found a way\nYou know to win a championship but that would probably be my only thing um but again this is all you know they can't have any major injuries step was hurt but they still found a way to win a championship\nAnd you look at the Lakers and we talked about this with LeBron going there or I'm going to make it a little bigger picture here for the wrong too windy MVP he's the favorite what kind of season does he have to have slashed the Lakers have to have\n[noise] if the Lakers win fifty plus games and\nFind themselves in the top four in the western conference and the wrong goes for\nTwenty eight eight and a\nMassive E. pi 'cause right now I personally have them maybe the sixth or seventh best team in the west\nAnd I have them anywhere between forty to forty six when put of who ... who finds a way to get these young guys all over the same page or playing at a higher clip and they could win fifty plus\nGames um it's all going to be driven by LeBron James and I think that's where he could arguably when his fifth or it would be\nI like the Lakers death threats I mean I I think they have a lot of bodies there I I'm not big on some of the older guys they brought in but I get it from one year can that be a big advantage for the Lakers\nYou this huge young legs and a coach wall um has been very adamant about that that he wants to run and he makes that youth those yoga legs\nA with a generational type player like LeBron James I'm getting easy baskets that's going to be key\nI'm getting easy baskets that could be key\nProblem I have with the Lakers if I'm not quite sure they have enough shooting yeah and for the wrong to be successful you've gotta have shooters on the edges around so he can penetrate collapsed that defense and kick it out or will they pass through one of the all time great passers\nBut you've got to have shooters out I'm not sure they have enough shooting\nI like Anthony Davis this year for the MVP but I I just not sure like the pelicans are kind of irrelevant and even though they made the playoffs last year [laughter] how long do you think Anthony Davis is in New Orleans\n[noise] well I find with ... sports correct to fall and and so forth runs group runs guys right yeah\nSo you know I'm sure ... you know around the water cooler people are talking this could be his last year I Hope it's not you and I have had this conversation for many a times it's great to have superstars\nAnd smaller markets and obviously New Orleans is one of the smaller markets in the NBA um but in today's age was social media you know fans all almost all part of the game and all the talk is what have you done to the playoffs have you won a championship\nAnd
