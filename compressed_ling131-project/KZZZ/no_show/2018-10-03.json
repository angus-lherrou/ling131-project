the into the process quietly under the radar and not destroy people's lives was completely ignored so it goes to show what Feinstein and all about it's a shame and she has looked this country I'm part she looked this country on fire\nNow I think we now see what ah what time is are we now see it this is the this is wakeup time\nThe truth is always comes back to find you know it does no matter what the situation it always comes back\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule I care once in a while ago I was walking and find\nThat site where it's like and I don't know what happened I had the after effects of that in my hand and my late and I noticed that I get that you don't have that anymore\nAnd that would bring the economy to a standstill so these these folks that are running on the left shouldn't get a bike first base and they're getting a look just did they have so much money coming in from ... blue and so that's our challenge right now it's\nJust getting the the facts out like you said or as you open what is a act blew a that shift the big nationwide you know Democrats fund raising he they have\nRepublicans don't have that they do\nDo more of the party Democrat bundle they you know they're billionaires lined up across the country and then they bundled at all to their preferred candidates by state\nAnd so my opponent for example just like seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars in August alone in one month which is just unheard of races in the past never cost that much it's are Democrats are raising their hand over fist they don't ... on policy we would win eighty two white\nBut they they just are going off you know she's running commercials that I'm against pre existing conditions and has a very emotional piece a with a young boy and medical coverage et cetera except the whole piece is just utterly falls and they're doing that all candidates across the country\nThey're referring to a procedural vote before we voted for Republican or health care piece that did have pre existing conditions\nAnd so they're just it's it's a lie of the first order and they're doing it across the board and so we we've got to get the word out to voters and so folks out there you know look up to\nDate Brett dot com and help me out it yeah\nOut there you know look update Brett dot com and help me out it yeah\nYeah Dave Brat dot com everyone go there ah contribute to this campaign because Republicans are being outspent because we have mega billionaires led by siren George Soros is the Washington Free beacon pointed out a few days ago\nRolling out huge amounts of money for state focus donations for a campaign's excuse me\nAnd they know it it just comes down to turn out in a midterm race it comes down to turn out in energy\nAnd Donald Trump demonstrated I think very well that it's not just you know it's not just uh how much money to spend on advertising however uh it it ... it matters that you get air time it matters that you\nAre fighting for the people against these type of focus tactics\nAre on the left or this these vicious intimidation campaigns the demonization of boys and men and brothers and fathers\nAnd husbands and I would stick to all those issues congressman because I think this I think this is Brett Kavanaugh issue even\nThough you're in the house and it's all determined in the Senate I think it cuts across party lines I think it is an awakening for Republicans is mid term election cycle your thoughts\nYeah no you're you're right on the ... I I Want without wanting it a path\nBut this one the millions and billions being spent and then the tactics that you met my town hall there they seven hundred activists came up from the laughs wearing a pastor as he gave the opening prayer at my left town hall it's all all on video people go Google it that people just ... door Walker's plan for\nA campaign just left a piece on my house my daughter is home alone for people show up at the door looking at my windows taking pictures walking around my house to leave a piece of ... health day that my daughter has to retrieve you know half hour later she stayed in the house that go out that God\nUh and then the young man that was busted we have video of all of it ends up talking to spanberger within a half hour\nAnd so I you know I what do you conclude from that uh it it's not good out their their their you know ... people at a restaurant\nA note due process or in it it's the leftist fighting with tactics we've just never seen before it especially on the phone but it's a get out there no matter where you are in this country and support the support good conservatives are that are out there running because they need help right now there's a lot of folks\nThat are deep down in numbers on running a tight one and so all they need help too but uh it just ... you're right or we just need to stay on message is\nOne of the biggest thing Iran I was immigration and the left there's nothing that separates that the mainstream voter writes a Seventy eighty percent issue the left right and I was ... open borders\nA sanctuary city is no rule of law and they're they're running as moderates but they're left of JFK by a mile and so that's the big new change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results in this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's yeah in fact so her ceilings it's information over intimidation results silver resistance I'll say it over and over and over again\nYep GDP is four point to write and how it's going to be over four and a half right it's unheard of ... what Kennedy achieve radiate Kennedy did supplies\nI but I Will tell you Dave Dave I'll tell you this and I tell us on my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there is a region your opponent is doing a commercial with a a with a medically challenge child it's\nAbout a motion so you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been a had been you have are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington\nAnd and yeah well that that's right that's what you need I mean I ... the numbers are you know that's it's great\nBut you get people yeah hold on a on a motion\nGoing with that my my opponent said don't don't look at the numbers are skinny number and my response to that air go look at a hundred billion Walmart shoppers\nWho sales are through the roof and then at the kitchen table issue right everybody's life is way better off now everybody ... thousand bucks back in the pocket and it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue and so they\nAre they're they're running against the good news ah I'm I like where we are but uh\nWe we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing invested ... together and like you said we've got to type stories\nThat's where I ended up people is Ryan and raising money for you for joining the money just for the a congressional campaign a committee but is he ... ... ... raising money in part is are you getting money from them\nYeah Yup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out in a a bunch of other outside groups or\nYup yup Paul Ryan's or helped out in a a bunch of other outside groups are recovering help out a thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country\nAnd uh we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the optimism every small business cycle meat whipped up by the new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment they're hiring one more person that but that's a huge deal most of where I live just regular small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they'd have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need everybody out everybody not vote tell your church your church your business is your sports clubs\nJust all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward with its was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing base and\nThank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a President Trump President Trump by the way in the rose garden ah yesterday a or was it yesterday on Monday ties Monday during the NAFTA announcement said this\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they won border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very find people that are running in close races in may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually rightness political calculation is he is he right to put this also and the Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our leverage right we we let it be known nine Senate Democrats will block us it's All right now we don't at the beginning of the cycle or it after the election our laboratory back to a hundred percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and that we got that fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rally and cried up his election\nAnd of mine and the people want to see it\nA nine Senate Democrats ... uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole parties gotta come\nThe president on this immigration issue because it is the issue that just\nDivides the crony elites up in the city from the average person back in my district that everybody I talk to\nYou you want a wall you want to seal the border you want to get rid of uh the gang activity and it it it's not just immigration is tied to the opioid problem Fenton all three hundred billion lethal doses of ... know him across the border this year in one year\nThat's like the human trafficking that's like the gang

victim they are accusers\nThey may end up being a victim that we can call them but if we're going to presume innocence and I know there's an old fashioned idea if you're going to presume\nInnocence you must presume innocence which means this is the accuser your honor this is not the victim because one she's a victim what happens well we're supposed to believe could you look up the word believe [noise]\nUh yes I I can we are now being taught believe the victim\nBelieve okay uh two definitions of the word belief did have an issue number one except something as true field shore of the truth of\nOK so not just your or something is true so people now are saying believe the victim which is translating\nFeel sure that this person has been harmed or injured\nIn a ... in an event of some sort okay and and in this area and his response ... classical yes okay so you are being told\nWhen someone says something I have to believe and assume that we give me the definition again except something is true I have to accept this as\nFields sure can feel sure that it's\nSet up to this as true fields sure it can feel sure that it's true that this person has been harmed or went through an act caused by this person wow that's a that's quite a statement that doesn't seem logical at all\nBut should only happen after ... ... you know that was beyond a reasonable doubt write like that where standard if they're what's the second version of believe um hold something as an opinion\n... sink or suppose\nThat seems like the one they're applying here they're just trying to make it seem like I Believe you I'm sure of the truth when in reality it's just their opinion there supposing it's true mhm they think it's true\nNow do you want to be judged or have your dad your brother your\nSon your sister your mother your friend\nHave so world assume that if something is true because someone stated it\nWith out evidence the answer is no\nBut we are being taught the next generation is being taught to believe the victim\nHere's the thing when you present evidence and I see preponderance of evidence I Will believe the victim\nNow that's not even through court of law I just want a preponderance of evidence I Want to see it now you'll notice that last week it was looking pretty dicey for Kavanaugh\nThis week it looks like there's been some things that the press is reporting on some people coming to the table saying okay I flew with her in a small plane in Hawaii\nAnd it's small plane that single engine plane it only had one exit it was cramped it was just us she didn't have a fear of flying she didn't have a ... we went out to go circle the volcano what are you talking about a fear of flying she didn't have a fear of flying\nThe people coming out now saying the reason why she had the second door I was there\nYou all you have to do is go look at the permits she was building an office in her house it wasn't for escape it was because she was having clients come to that door and not to the front door\nI have two front doors because I'm afraid not according to the permits not according to why wait you put a front door because you were afraid why did you put the office there what'd you put several after him there\nOf all things would you want to be random clients coming over your house all the time when I Want to separate that from your business as much as possible\nOkay so I don't know what's true I don't know it's true but I certainly do not supposed to believe her I don't think she's I don't know if she's a victim or not I don't know she may be a victim but he may not be the perpetrator\nRight I mean the only person who should be calling her a victim is herself if she let let's just say this did happen to her\nShe can fairly call herself a victim because she knows that happened to her if if it's true right but even if it's true none of us should be calling or a victim at this point that victimhood from society identifying he was a victim as when other people have some confirmation of the trial going through there are enough information to prove that there is\nOne proven victim between the two of them right now one proven victim\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh who now can't teach up at Harvard because all of the graduate students are saying we're not having a rapist ...\nWho can't ... if you can't the coaches basketball games anymore because they can have a rapist ... he is now a victim now that I've now assume that he's innocent\nUm no no no wait wait wait negative tons of notice of victim even if he's guilty he's a very ... of mob justice right because they have not perfectly correct he's a victim of mob justice\nI'm not saying that he is he is not rightfully victim\nThis point it sure doesn't look like it this is mob justice so far [noise] um she also is a victim she's a victim of the Democratic party and leadership she is been victimized\nShe has been dragged out when she said she didn't want to be dragged out she was lied to when they when the Republicans said we'll go out and meet with you you don't have to fly\nThey didn't tell her that she's a victim by the Democratic party and they don't care they do not care that is the real tragedy of this to people's lives are for ever changed one if she is making this up\nIts on her and quite fun frankly so is the victim mode of him it's on her\n\nLook at what's happened for political purposes only and if you think the Democrats\nThere's only and if you think the Democrats\nAnd I think there are people who vote Democrat I think there are people who vote for the Republican I think there are people who vote for Kavanaugh actually feel bad for Christine forward I think they actually feel bad for because they don't know she\nMay be something happened I was willing to say last week that I think something happened and I don't know it is becoming less and less clear to me that even something happened\nBecause of all of the other testimony now that it's coming out that saying no I I was ... her boyfriend for ten years nine years none of this none of this happened\nI I don't know right away I frankly\nDo not believe her by either one of those definitions I don't suppose is and I don't know it's true\nAn outlook I could be wrong on this but she had ... not ... it's like you know it can be a hundred percent sure that just didn't occur we weren't there but that's why we have a system to try to figure out those situations and were never there for crimes okay for almost never there for them\nSo you'll notice that you are presumed innocent look up two words assume and presume in our standard you are presumed innocent until proven guilty you're not assumed you are presumed what's the difference presume\nIs usually used when you suppose something based on probability\nSo the odds are based on what we know she doesn't know the house she doesn't know the time she doesn't know the months you know nobody here\nThe people that she said here they'll testified that they were there ... all of them disagree all of them say I don't have any recollection of this at all so she has no witnesses\nShe ... the the documents from her doctor conflict with her report she has changed the time four times in the last four month or two months so and that is sketchy because it it appears as though she kept moving closer because Brett Kavanaugh would have been out of state\nIf it would have been where she originally claimed mhm so all of those\nChanges so what's the preponderance of evidence\nWhat are the odds based on the evidence the odds are he didn't do it that's the presumption of innocence what is assumed innocence assume it's used when you suppose something without any evidence\nSo no one is asking you to assume he's innocent we're asking you to look at the facts and then play the odds based on those facts what are the odds that she has it right\nSo let's stop using the word victim\nAnd let's stop saying we're going to believe every victim we're not we're going to take seriously the accusation from the accuser and then we'll look for the facts [noise] alright mercury real estate these\nWell the adolescent brain ...\nReminds adults in the lobby county it's a party

sixth largest than it is it's not even in the south in the entire history of the United states\nThis debt increase again under Republican control is larger than many of the years under the Obama

more contingent on like a purchase at a bookstore a digital media transaction is continuous linking buyer and seller and giving\nThe seller oppose transaction power impossible and physical markets why is that important\n[noise] so I I think this is important for a an a number of reasons that leads to these scenarios we were talking about earlier where the ... of the good as the ability not only to reclaim\nOr or recall the good but they also have some ability to control how and when and under what\nCircumstances you make use of that product after the sale that's just not something that you could do in the tangible world right you or your local bookstore put aside the publisher your local bookstore can't tell you what country you're allowed to read a book and they can't tell you\nUm you know how many times you get to read it they can't tell you who you get to lend that book too and they certainly can't keep records of all of those interactions and the digital world allows for\nA that that form of control [noise] and unfortunately it's not limited just to digital media or we have all these smart devices in our homes on our bodies um you know we've got our voice assistance\nAnd hour fitness trackers and you know even a home appliances and cars\nThey all have software\nThey all have network connections and all the sort of a problem is that as I've been describing are going to play out in that space as well and where device makers are not only going to be able to track your behavior but they're also going to be able to limit the ways in which you can use the products\nThat you think you have\nPurchased so I'm Still living in a let me interrupt hearing and just ask you this icy when I go to iTunes I see my movie I Want to watch it says rent\nOr own I'm not only yet I'm just renting it in a different way isn't is false advertising\nI so I think there is a really good case to be made here that companies like Amazon and apple they use language like oh and by\nWords that have real meaning for people in their everyday lives are missed stating that the nature of those transaction so uh my coauthor Christos ... go and I wrote a paper a few years ago a couple of years ago now I'm ... what we buy when we buy now\nThat did a survey of about Fifteen hundred consumers to figure out what people think this language new and it turns out that a significant percentage of consumers incorrectly believe\nThat they do have true ownership rights they get to keep these goods they can lend them they can give them away and we think that there is an opportunity here to\nA correct this misinformation in the marketplace but\nThink about the company that we're talking about you know apple and Amazon are two of the biggest corporations that the world has ever seen and getting them to\nA\nConvincing them to not going to stay in a more career and fair way as it is a real challenge\nClass action lawsuit\n[noise] so I think there is a possibility for class action litigation here they're they're a bunch of\nA legal or impractical hurdles to making that happen I think it's something worth pursuing I think the Federal Trade commission has a role to play year this is a squarely within their\nUm [noise] uh within their areas of of expertise and obligation to police market and make sure that consumers have accurate information\nParent um go ahead yeah I I just want to go into\nThe the the way the market works depends on consumers be fought people can't make rational choices people can't decide where to spend their money if they're being misled about the products that they're getting so I think it's crucial for for the function of the market uh to have that information be correct\nHave you done any look into what a society with out real ownership I mean we're down to you know renting clothes and everything else\nUh and that's only going to get stronger as as as we move forward have you looked into what that means for a capitalist society and for America in particular\nThat has always been about ownership\nBut my biggest concern here is the way this change is kind of our conception of ourselves in the way we think about ourselves as individuals in society\nDo we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it those decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who takes something and then tinkers with it comes up with a better system but if I'm if I'm locked out of tinkering\nOn my own property uh it it ... it it almost creates this uh this feeling of oh well that's just the way it is and that's the way it always is going to be it just runs that way and it's the opposite of it\nAnd that have been made over the centuries in this country that didn't come from giant corporate hiring deeds apartments they came from individuals messing around with things that down in their garage and there is a risk that were for closing those kinds of opportunities but even even more broadly at\n'em if we're discouraged and thinking of ourselves as independent actors in the world [noise] and I worry that that creates a sort of complacency in\nUh in our in our population in our country and you know not not to zoom out a to July to the level here but for a democracy to function people have to steal and\nThey have to be in charge of their own lives she asked to be invested in making informed decisions and ...\nThat that ... you know this this lack of control over the every day this is my play too much broader set of problems when it comes to people feeling like active participant in society and democracy\nI couldn't agree with you I couldn't agree with you more um I I just don't think this is the way society is thinking anymore everything is about the collective\nAnd very little is about the individual and you know I think you understood that you are under state of the case of tankers I mean if you look at the inventions in America that a lot of them a lot of our progress came from what used to be called tankers\nPeople who just did things in their own garage in and uh\nAnd now the weather's the government or these corporations every one is being told that the way it is sit down shut up you can't do anything about it and I think that's extraordinary I mean that that that you know in in decades that's what created China in many ways that's what\nThey don't think of things the same way that we do they don't have that that um spirits of\nInvention that America has always been known for\n\nSo I I agree with you that um that the history of innovation in this country has um benefited greatly from individual\nCreators and that we should we need to keep an environment in which people have that ability to experiment um to innovate and ultimately it to just share\nA that progress a with a with the rest of the country and the rest\nOf the world I worry that we're moving in that direction where um people aren't able to build those skill sets because they live in a world of sort of locked down digital life\nSo let me ask you one more question and I'll let you go I Know you've spent twice the amount of time here that you you'd probably planned on 'em\nBut Lance who one more question I'm really concerned about copyrights patents trademarks we seem to be entering a world where people don't take somebody's intellectual property seriously on the on the other side of this\nUm they just feel that to well I can download it I can just take it\nA an itch we shouldn't have intellectual property rights that that is frightening because again that was the second piece of the American experiment was\nYou have a right to that intellectual property for a period of time so you can make money on it which encourages other people to come up with their own ideas\nDo you see this why do you see this fading and is this trouble on the horizon as well\nSo I I write in each about intellectual property and it's something that they are they take 'em very seriously and one of the things that I always try to communicate to my students is that you know actual property system functions best when there is a\nBalance between the interests of the public in the interests of\nCreators and the history of intellectual property copyright in particular is it is a history of a struggle\nTo find and and and that appropriate about 'em\nAnd I think we're we're going through and have been going through a kind of since the last for adoption of the Internet a period where we're struggling with how to answer some of those questions\nAre there are certainly areas in which um cops right holders have legitimate concerns about air works being exploited without compensation and on the other hand we live in a culture in which um\nCopyrighted works a sort of\nUm increasingly\nAmong a distributed with within these environments like apple and Amazon for example where consumers can't do the things that they think they're entitled should be ready to do it so I think that part of the solution here is\nUm that's one of the things that streaming service is I shouldn't have gotten great\nEr which is that they offer a really attractive to consumers so people learn that if they're going to access the world's libraries is that they have to pay for the privilege or you're not how that money gets distributed\nAnd what the price point is I think is is one of the sticking points so it's an important set of questions and I'm One that I probably can't do justice to um\nYou know a couple of minutes yeah All right Aaron thank you so much I appreciate it

or\nMitch recalled the creepy line the creepy line dot com um we're talking about Google and Larry I've never I've never believed in you know those\nDystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah this is this is crazy that you know the corporations out to get you\nBecause of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing that is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms that we have to keep that top secret because\nYeah they were they argue is this is for reasons of of a state secret um and and you know that they need to protect our trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it\nThere's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before you know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho were saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies switch okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat out lied and said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results or ... or or organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying\nTo the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with us um you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council\nYou give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices are in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have it I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil standard oil that's going to dominate the all Martha visits controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the and Peter ... controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first\nControls everything there is no way to beat it probably once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it\nIf we don't have them\nContained in some way or another when they get to a I worked ... yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize that I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information um if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um\nWhat can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing gangs all of it look\nThere's that this is just at the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for what he's doing how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy picked somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter] they had a picture of the guy\nAnd the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then after like an hour or two they gave the leaves system the picture of the guy and said find him in eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car unbelievable in ... minutes yeah city of twenty two million yeah\nUnbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million it's amazing in eight minutes yeah so and this is with out AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming to people really need to pay attention to\nThat's right and and Google or is it the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick so on Gmail this very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what'd she mailed does they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you've ever written a draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what\nI don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it's not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct if scanned by Google\nSo Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend whatever Google knows more about you than they do\nAnd they are very aggressively going to retain that information\nBut they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy it's manipulation because they want to take that information and not just sell information to advertisers they as part of their mission wants to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nTo Peter Schweitzer the documentaries the creepy line a couple of pushback and a couple of things sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of this\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome it's all of the products that they make are better than everybody else's product but it's similar ... and it it would eat incredibly inconvenience me to give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's\n... doesn't know [laughter] what are you there because I mean\nYes they're everywhere but they also do a really good job or when it comes to designing an easy to use product\nRight ... that's that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google and it's\nNot really I don't know I think that's a a a road that people will go down\nThat you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this fight to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech\nIn Washington because they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior fright it's to the point we must corralled Google\nAnd break them up or corralled them in some way not with just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but not live just little simple laws of ...\nBecause they'll go around that that fire\nRight okay let me ask one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution was the were leaning towards breaking up these companies and as a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you have a bridge\nThat gap no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly today I says I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem in this space the way that technology is moving how Google exerts it's market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nUh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we we interviewed a vice president of Yelp\nOr in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start up today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities have survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago\nTo where they can exist so we have a situation where they're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance is partly related\nTo its political science in Washington may pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe\nAnd to do things like the platform ing yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now Europe publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nAnd that's a hugely important point because when they first one it or it set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you are a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are\nIf you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they said we're not going to any concept they even use the analogy were like a telegraph we're\nJust taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening when we all know that's not true now they're editing or they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burden that they do so it's a ... year competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google editing right now that they are right the wouldn't one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\n[noise] Ah yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have\nUm I think by breaking them up into pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different Columbia but also bad [laughter] [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this because otherwise they're going to continue to reexamine market dominance\n... the other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility\nOh no no [laughter]\nTerrified I don't know what the chilies are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] we don't really have a we have to open the energy yeah oh that's so we have five different ... and yeah we don't pay any yeah like you know\nSharing of making Google a public utility ... which really means you're making it a government utility generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two

M. K. triple the I'm your host and now I'm just as most of these mid week days I have a David Lourdes here in the studio with me today that oh Dan how are ya I'm All right\nThey if people want to come in a color that is rather what are they do\nWilling king when it's nice to eight seven five three twelve thirty Bullhead city nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety and of course the toll free number one eight four four to one nine one to five zero where the email is Dave at talk a to Z dot com\nAnd that that's Tio spell they spelled out a to Z dot com now Dave tell people while you're in here to do every Wednesday\nWell today we're giving the initial we're going to give the stats what's happening hobby county and I've got a couple of very special guests gonna joined us here in a couple of minutes\nDecided to have them on the show but let's so let's do the stats right now for real estate in Mojave counting right run down the numbers already okay well let's see uh to date has all three hundred and thirty three homes last year to this day they sold two hundred and eighty that means that there are Eighteen point nine percent\nOf the average home price was one sixty two nights\nUh this is interesting though there are average home price was one Seventy two a little higher than Bullhead city last year was one sixty one and they're up seven percent or ... valley uh sixty two homes to date\nA last year was one forty one actually the hobby valley sixty two last year was fifty six so they're up ten percent or their average sale prices one forty one uh last year was one Eighteen they are up Nineteen point three percent in in ... valley came in a\nThree hundred and Ninety six home so to date last year three sixty one there are nine point six eight percent and a ... or ... lake cabin Sioux City five forty three last year was six eighty eight they're down\nTwenty one percent and uh we were talking with some people they're trying to figure that out it's one or two things are pricing is getting up there or there are image tore up available homes is a diminished um but their average home prices to Ninety two five\nLast year was to sixty four and so they're up ten point six percent so those are the numbers for the week but nationally\nUh it's interesting because home prices for the year from from this week to last year's this week uh is up six point three percent on the average so you know if you look at our numbers were actually trending a bit higher a than national it's just because everybody wants to move here since you're wonderful place to be\nSunday 'cause everybody want to buy a house to get a roof over their heads exactly\nThe other static grabbed me this week was that the average sales price nationally was up six six point seven percent over the high water mark in two thousand six that was amazing wow I didn't know that and the highest uh jumpers were a Las Vegas and um Seattle\nAnd they were talking about the unbelievable growth a pickle ball and uh it's apparently according to the news\nThe number one fastest growing sport in the United states that are that shocked me\nAnd then this week uh I called the guy I said hey can I meet you at nine AM he says no I've got a pickle ball match that I'll be done around ten thirty course so pickle ball has now for the first time affected my life [laughter]\nAnd uh but it's not the it's not the last time I'm going to find out more about that [noise] you know you touched on um a events okay\nAnd later in the show today a Toby the city manager Toby Kotter put out a\nState of the city kind of a email last week and one of them was talking about the Bullhead city\nHas become and the word that I had had her use of sports mecca and I had no I Do you how big involved that was there's a a less than ... later of events that are a virtual year round\nAnd when you talked about economic impact you don't normally think about parks and economic impact in the same sentence okay\nI feel like everyone's standing do forget about public parks these days it almost feels like an old fashioned thing well not in Bullhead city 'cause we have pickle ball courts that are a ... foot oh don't get me wrong they're marvelous and fantastic but I feel as though they might have fallen unfortunately a little out of the public consciousness especially with the younger generations well I'll tell you what Dave\nHe think Clint Stevens during the set that strict today I'll tell you that have um [noise] the ah the thing that was how are you you touched on was events and up and economic development and I'll get into the details later but\nUh we chatter just before we got on here that the fact that a city the size of Bullhead say approaching forty three thousand rough you know take her\nTake her take away a couple of hundred um\nThey had become this sports mecca and there are very unique community because even in Phoenix it would be hard to put on a massive sporting event because the hotels are kind of spread out around town here we have ten thousand rooms basically within one mile stretch\nThat we get to use for and for these kind of facility so when a person comes here to play that say a softball tournament getting I'm not talking about the older guys let's say a teenager\nWhen he comes to the tournament here he didn't commit themselves that's right he's bringing a mom and dad and their grandparents and aunts and uncles and everybody want to see him in that term is that what you're finding\nTo a hundred percent true I mean we really started going with the old guys we started doing senior softball tournaments are about sixteen years ago and those grew and grew and grew and got huge and then we had to add another one\nAnd um you know why wasn't such a great economic impact on the community because those guys were bringing their wives with them there are retired they can come and make a weekend of it but\nYou hit the nail on the head when we bring the little kids um they it's just my daughter's got a softball tournament rotary park\nUm she's going to bring her brother and sister and her mom and dad and it's it's a big economic impact and you're absolutely right the guy great room rates across the river we got ten thousand of them um the weather here is great most of the year I mean we're able to do soccer tournaments when other places it's just flat out too cold to do it\nUm so we're able to do that throughout the year and you know\nAs people come they spend money in this area they fall in love with the area and they really do and then they come back for another tournament they come back just a vacation you know because we have lots of fun things to do on the water you know [noise]\nUm so it it and we're in this great little place Bullhead city it's kind of at the epicenter\nAnd we're in this great little place Bullhead city it's kind of at the epicenter of Los Angeles and\nPhoenix in Vegas and even San Diego people don't have a hard time making that trip yeah you know from those big area's incoming here in in bringing us you know a couple of hundred soccer teams you know Seventy or eighty softball teams and just and really make a nice weekend of it\nYeah and um you know nothing against Las Vegas I Love Las Vegas that it'd be tough to take a family uh with uh the extended family to a hotel in Vegas you know for a sporting event it gets a get a little pricey ah two and make it difficult but here\nWe are kind of welcome them with open arms not only the hotels and and that's as bad a part of it but on the ball hit side of things here they go shopping they buy clothes they buy food for certain um ah restaurants uh I I think I recall Toby saying that we were we were actually\nOn some of the big tournament days some of the restaurants that actually run out of food\nThat is right there they're catching up with us now but we didn't like you're on those stories of this pizza shop running out of do during the tournament that that's kind of a rough one day here but they're they're catching up now they're realizing what's happening on the weekend how it benefits them and uh you know it's good for everybody throats just sort of surprised everybody\nYeah it certainly has and Clint where we're going to get to you and just one second I did have a couple of the questions for a day um are you familiar because I'm not familiar with the evolution of rubber park when it started with their ...\nI'm very familiar with the evolution of rotary part because I used to live in that neighborhood I've lived here for forty four years so you know I've seen that come from when I was a kid you know ten to twelve years old running around ride my bike and what was called the black forest\nOr as it was all overgrown with zero weeds and salt theaters to 'em about ninth and in the early to mid eighties is when the Rotary Club or which is\nYou know Dan Taylor who his name's all over the parks and the city of\nTerms of ... a supporter and has been for decades or that his community\nAbsolutely and he would the help of the the Rotary Club that he was in um got that land for the rpm beliefs and and uh that was the black forest and they they started working on a soccer field\nI'm just ten acres of grass right there on Lake side and um\nThey they made it and people came and then after that pop Warner got involved they put some lights on there and then it just\nWe put together a plan we put together a long range plan for that part that included the softball fields and everything you see there today I'm it's changed here and there over the years as\nAs the kind of the emphasis of what the community I mean five years ago we didn't even know where to go to the ... so they are now out of those out so it it's just been a really such a community driven park\nThe ... the Rotary Club has done more and more building or a modest building the skate park um building more soccer fields putting lights on all of it\nThey've done more and more we've had a community committee that got together built to solve the the dog park of them added orders have been involved the corps VHS legacy foundation\nUm you know anytime they want to do something for the health and wellness of this community um they want to get involved so you know they want to build a trail yeah do they want to build more soccer fields yes so um it's been it's been a great community effort of the community gets done kind of handed over to the city and we say okay we'll maintain that will put activities on it and it's a great\nPublic private partnership with this community and the city will head we love it\nThe next time you see a real carrion with his pin on his jacket stop and shake his hand and tell them thank you for a helping create a a an environment where families can enjoy all those facilities stay in and day out absolutely that's fantastic Clinton the rotary park is the um at the moment the\nStar of of the city and you've heard all the things we talked about a with a\nReport that the one that's getting a lot of attention right now is the extension of humidity park down at highway Ninety five\nAnd um there's a lot of construction a lot of people were curious about what was going to start happening there when they started the grabbing but uh\nSince you were the guy who plans these things and takes them and I went to a lot of your um a community or open houses and over the last couple of years or how did that get how did that involve how did that get started\nAgain well back in two thousand and sixteen Toby other approach for me to see if I could to assist and possibly put something together and we discussed and decided that we needed a lot more Republican put than what they've been in the past\nAnd so we did the public outrage as we had everybody come we gave everybody basically a blank sheet of the part I took one and said\nDo do me a favor what is your dream what are your hopes what do you want to see at community park what if you could have a piece of it what would you do fix all sorts of heard a lot of benefit\nWhat would you do to consult scores hurt a lot of a pickle ball courts\nSo we gave it to be scheduled another meeting everybody went home and they wrote letters and they colored their maps and they brought him to me and I took an I incorporated all their ideas onto the plan of development that we have\nAnd we did that two or three times because you know some things would change and we want this and we really were fond of this and\nAnd by the end of it we were able to approach lead below them and give them a plan of development and give them a timeline and they approved it so now we're moving forward and picking community park from Wall was approximate twenty six acres and we've taken it up to now will be for about two hundred and Ninety eight\nAcres apart but it's going to be developed over a ten year plan\nRight well the one thing that exciting is that uh you're being able to call this the will come back to the second call this the humidity beach park using the word ... beach always gets people's attention agreed agreed\nWith their luggage is All right this is alive and logo in the afternoon here on ... I have David Lourdes clip Stevens and Dave he's\nOur our city staff to get this done and I think he's done a beautiful job and I want to pay complement to everybody that's working hard for this\nFor the three year plan or looking at the main river walk shoreline settled stabilization round about insurance paved public parking areas frontage roads event areas to host public gatherings are installing dizzy most of the picnic sites the playground areas the walking and bike paths\nWorking on getting them rein in beach things sports areas and all the park facilities required to a function without\nThen within the ten years we're going to go to the other side of highway Ninety five and we're going to go to the paved public parking area there the furniture roads the event areas to host public gatherings again because evils picnic sites playground areas hiking trails walking bike paths basketball courts tennis courts\nBaseball fields soccer fields pickle ball courts and again additional park facilities\nNow with that we've also been brought in additional ideas for doing handball and I'm\nRacket ball court so that people would be able to enjoy that as well\nThat sounds wonderful you know um Clinton to the lady that called in a minute ago um [noise] she doesn't have the benefit of looking at this is there a Web site she can go to and get a copy of this a map that we're looking at\nAbsolutely you to go to W. W. W. dot Bullhead city dot com all spelled out and you can go through on the planning and zoning portion of it under the departments and or it should be available under the parks and rec page as well\nThat sounds great you know going back a ... Dave I'm David um [noise] the section or the um [noise] I called section twelve but the community park a beach part I'm looking at the facility is there a this amphitheater how many people is that is\nRoughly that plan to hold or maybe that would be a question for you couldn't you know by other than a couple of thousand\nWhen we could definitely hold events with a couple of thousand people I mean we do that right now and we're really expanding the potential for events in that park and the reason why that's so important is because um you know this is really bullets cities original municipal park you know forty years ago it was called trash can park when they just\nGreat and the whole area and put a couple of trash cans out there and it was still the place where people did a ... yeah so we've been doing events there for forty years um you know you have things like the farmer's markets and and bluegrass festival out there um\nThese days and and it still it it's such a great place because when people drive by on the highway they have what's going on there they see something happening there so for us to be able to expand the advance potential of that park was really important and and we've done just that and we're going to do it\nAnd the has a trash can technology over the past forty years improve the park and its availability of space the real improvement is how often we dump them so\nThat's a good point for science that you know the one thing as I drive by there and as people do drive by on Ninety five and they look over to the west towards the river and see these are heavy equipment and the ... mountains of sand and have obviously notice the grub is grabbing was was done\n'em when they see that um\nCan expect something ... as I see the plan here I've seen pictures of lake cabin soon lady who called and mentioned like cabbage soup or as part of that and you remember hearing that right now yeah yeah I've seen and um [laughter] and the ... and if you notice\nThere's this picture I had I think is probably from spring break and but there are hundreds of boats that are being watched and channel and you have people on the beach and you have people behind the beach on in the park areas and so forth\nAnd you have people behind the beach on the in the park areas and so for them it's just a fabulous a place to gather and I see this is the new gathering place that says specially when it comes to the uh to the river because you know frankly um\nThat's one of the things is is not the biggest thing that draws people here is to be able to experience have as you mentioned Dan have an interaction with the Colorado the mighty Colorado\nThe mighty Colorado Carver of a Grand Canyon\nExactly and so this is going to make it a very\nEasy access to safe\nUm I'm sure you have patrols and your parks or surf dirty patrols and so forth both police found park rangers rangers in both of them so you know a safe place to take your family and enjoy the the river and then on top of that we just spoke a few minutes ago\nThey don't want to go back to the sports a mecca um these facilities here this will just compliment what you already have a ... park as I said\nOh that's right I mean people love but we haven't rode report because you can do so much there are one of the things that we haven't rotary park that you can't really find anywhere um too much in the south West is just the the sheer numbers of acres that we have for soccer so if I have a\nTwo of my kids playing in a soccer tournament I can have one playing on the Northfield mother playing on the Southfield I'm an hour apart and I didn't get to see both of those games because it's used to walk from here to there [noise] um when we add this to to our plan of development\nAnd we've got those seven fields and community park and reduce for baseball and softball games and now we've got four more here and it's still it's not like\nA you know I don't want to slight Vegas I Love Vegas but it's not like\nA driving from ... ah ever gave the freeways and an hour long traffic that's right it's it's just you know from community parked rotary park um you know it's not even Fifteen minutes so it's easy to get from one place the other and we can really have nice great big events and and both of those are right along the Colorado River which is just a bonus but people love\nYeah and uh you know with the ... with these facilities or you know I think people I Hope hearing this and maybe they hear it and tell their friends you know and realize how extensively the city has and how important lead they have taken\nThe cause of family recreation you know to uh uh for the community and for gas you know uh you know I always see these um I hear these stories about people all the snow birds are here and all that\nYou know every time I see a license plate that says Minnesota or some said on it all I I ... my I see a dollar sign it just says dollars you know and because we got about Fifteen or twenty thousand of them that stay\nHere or for um for the winter\nAnd you know they're buying groceries are going to the stores are going to a doctor that go into pharmacies you know they're they're spending their money here so having these types of facilities attract people from all over the country\nUm is fabulous uh it just got a couple of seconds left I just I failed to mention that our staff today were brought to you by Dana Kudrow Kelly Stallman Sandy port the ... river team outlaw ranch info center\nAll right well we're going to head into a

field because we saw situation in the Kansas City Denver game\nExplained to me from Anne in officiating standpoint of what you're supposed to be with the clock and when the ... snapped\nMorning Dan great to be with you again so with the plight clock it's first of all it's not intended to be like a shot clock in basketball it's not it's not a technical application of a rule that they want enforced every single time so mechanically\nWill wait wait what ... what does that mean Terry that they don't want\nThat means there are a lot of technical violations that happened during the course of a game\nThat you just don't want called you want warnings issued you want you know you want it to be a little more obvious that an error there that are that are ... getting been committed because just like fans believe does not want a lot of unnecessary flags\nSo and delay of game as one of them it's you know at the clock doesn't start instantly when the ... doesn't start instantly when the plays over you know there's a one or two can't\nIt's just a general guideline that we want the ball snapped within about forty seconds of the previous play so mechanically\nYou know they they assign it to the baggage a cheese with a guy in the middle of the field on on the defensive side weigh about ... yards from the ball right\nSo he's watching the play clock and I noticed in Denver it's it's low so that helps them a little bit so he's watching it it hit zero\nThen he goes to find the ... the ball has the snapper started moving the foot ball at that point if he if it's clearly still on the ground then he's gonna shut the game down and throw a flag if the ball is starting to move at about that time he's going to let it go\nAnd and what's interesting about this this happens two three four times I Would say in just about every football game yeah where it's it's bang bang like that and it's almost never ever commented on because the subsequent flight doesn't really mean anything\nWell on Monday Night the subs to apply actually was a big place so now it becomes a huge talking point that the ... you know Denver's outraged\nYou know the players are talking about it\nBut it's it's I mean this has been consistently for enforce this way\nSince I got in the league in Ninety eight and and and I'm certainly way before that this is not this is not anything unusual at all\nDid you hear from the legal office and they said look guys don't hold it unless it's really you know the greed just like it is that is that what the directive was absolutely\nIt is you don't want the ball to the clearly on the ground when the eyes get to the football from going from the plight clock in fact if you did it any other way\nIf the judge called it to technically they would get downgraded even though it was it zero at the instant that that the ball you know or that but then the ball was still on the ground\nIf if they threw the flight to quickly and shut the play down they would be downgraded in that situation\nI don't understand that like my wife have a rule\nThat you can't enforce it immediately ... but it\nIt's ... you're right it is loosely enforced because it's not like the plight clock is I mean it's not like the shot clocked in basketball it's it's it's a technical violation just like you know lining up you know illegal formations and\nAnd the defense has is as a space mass just barely in a neutral zone it's it's things that that that you could call constantly throughout the game but just just frustrate fans coaches\nIt throughout the game but just just frustrate fans coaches players officials that don't need to be called unless it's clearly obvious that that ... been committed\nBut you know staying on that the theme then you can call holding on every play\nRight okay you can't call holding on every place if if there's\nAny share it with the world know there he is holding on everything I can only play you can't call it every flight because just because\nOf player grabs the opponent it does not equate to a file you can grab inside the frame for the entire play I I mean just too big handfuls of Jersey the entire play and it's not if out so it can't be called every play it does happen\nI get you know you can have a first down marker is going to be loosely enforced here like is it a penalty or not a penalty now I don't want flights ... thrown on every play\nAnd I understand what he's saying does it really matter\nBut it did matter it didn't matter in the chief's game\nWould that play clock violation it wasn't called roughing the
