constitution and these guys for the constitution doesn't really matter\nThe spirit of the constitution and these guys for the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual so\nWell when we when we see the few moments of honesty from the Democrats [noise] ah when they really talk I'm candidly\nIt's about the fifth vote on the core it's not about whether Brent did then someone they're there and none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote on the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nFor I mean yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nWhen ... I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions in a white male they didn't go scholar and say you're a racist and we're going to\nStop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they try to use protocol use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's gonna be a conservative and therefore husband asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote there would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's taking us down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they went out that's that's a progressive idea of it\nThe noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know it's also interesting I think it's how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white uh but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch than MSNBC veteran let's listen\nNow for an entire generation of women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital reforms that as a man I was embarrassed that he was leaving ultimate display of of white ...\nThe man who made his money in part by opening up you know\nThe our NPR from selling selling snake with other people and also um you know hanging out of strip clubs by the way and self\n... I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that they've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being\nDevoured you see it with Diane Feinstein you're in California if you believe that how we appear educates who we are that is race class not class excuse me race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's been who's running against white Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color\nAnd the same thing is true of Chuck Schumer and the string things through ... there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy\nBut they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new wave but they're also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny door a sure you get all these other people say\nOr white guy old white guy old white guy even when\nThey were all like they're all old white guys\nIt's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nHave Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exempt shoe from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his ... and all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna you've had a good on TV\nLet's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities and wealthy ...\n[laughter] I Love that made me very happy very happy and he'd never happens don't expect it now ah\nThe we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in uh in California there has to be female representation on public points at which point at which point I tweeted out none of the Pacific islanders all Latino isn't\nA black people should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be a lot of these words from there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again\nThese are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be ... will join the kid who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed in percentage fashion of the population than there are so many different tribes with claims\nOf victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're gonna\nHave you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman\nBut I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white therefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves\nYou know a set a site on the sport I we're going down there and I don't know what the ultimate project for years but either people are going to say you know what it's getting chaotic when we go just stop the some go back to the melting pot\nJust look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're going to we're going to go into something like the Balkan\nYeah well I think again it it was all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good practice identity politics that you see that's even ... and the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hop or\nBy Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts I mean aren't really agreements county lesson I don't like his music and I'm not here not my not my cup of tea but\nTalking about brain going out on stage on Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive entertainment and wearing a make America great again hats standing on stage and this is how it went down\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI Can't hear an airplane that version of it but he didn't actually onstage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food he got he got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting chop the laughter will not tolerate any Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have worth and that's the kind of a revolutionary messy so west and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that will be patronize by government the title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the Astros its identity politics but it's all progressive so for\nWest it doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison 'em and you're charged with sexual assault\nWell it doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's most cases or gender or your race you have to have the proper raise the proper gender but you also have the ... have to have the proper ideology\nAnd they weren't all that time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and the in group thing thing all their age I mean how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how does it out of regular people stand up to the\nMy score mentor helped me take that for\nHelping create a

elected and they are putting in all of the policies that you want\nIt's it's your utopia\nThere remains about fifty percent of the country and I'm going to be really generous I going to make it a lot easier\nThere's thirty or forty percent of the country that disagrees with your utopia they just want to go in a different direction\nWhat do you do with the forty percent of the population that does not agree with you\nWhat do you do with them [noise]\nWhat do you do to make sure that those people don't start infecting the minds of authors\nSo your perfect utopia starts to fall apart\nWhat happens with the ones who won't comply with these new rules what do you do to make sure that that utopia it remains in place by keeping all of those people in power because there's going to be another election\nAnd if you have history tells us anything it swings the other direction what once you have the power what are you willing to do to keep the power\nIf your answer to all of those questions isn't nothing\n\nYou have gone over the cliff because in America the answer to what are you going to do to all of those people who disagree the answer in America is nothing what are you willing to do to keep your power or the answer in America is nothing\nWhat do you do to to silence those who will not comply the answer in America is nothing\n\nSo any time somebody says we should shout these people down they've taken the first step all Fox is creative\n\nWhen you begin to speak things they you speak them into existence\nWhen you say we shouldn't round people up the more people that say we should round people up we should disturb them in their own homes we should we should picket and surround their houses the more that you say that the more reality is created in that direction\n\nBe very careful on what you say and what you think\n\nThe answer to these questions in America must remain\nNothing\nI Will not do anything to my neighbor who disagrees to me with me I Will not do anything and everything to hold on to power\nIn the same building and I go to the army recruiter and he tells me son has got to be great we're gonna make\nYou a general and and the moms and you're going to be you know probably in the world and meeting beautiful women and I'm Seventeen thinking my God this is going to be great\nI Walk out with all of that go army stuff in my arms and the book covers and still in high school at the time and he said and as I'm walking out the wrinkle recorded there yes arms folded and he says a song that I talk to you that you're going side he goes that army guy he promised you a lot didn't he I said yes I Am going to be a general\nAnd like one of the world's gonna be amazing the beautiful women\nUnder the sun he goes you know what am I promise you I said what he said for ... years are you ready I said yes and I signed up when I look back at that and then I didn't know what I was doing what I'm saying I was just reacting but when I look back at that I Know I was desperately seek seeking positive male role models I didn't have\nAnd wrinkled gave me many of them and that was a a great thing that the marine corps of the military is not everybody and not much to join but for me it really helped me tremendously and I said all the time without the marine corps I would've been a punk because I was lost at Seventeen completely lost in the marine corps helped me tremendously\nAnd when I got out of the marine corps about seven years later [noise] um my mom had really gone into a very bad place um she couldn't handle me leaving she couldn't handle my father's death and she was addicted first illegal drugs and eventually illegal drugs and she was a victim of the drug war and she was a convicted felon so I pulled her out of prison\nAnd I used my whatever things I had to try to get her back up and running a reading her an apartment in the house that I mean I'm I'm a car that kind of thing and she struggled and if you if you've had a felon in your life and you know hard it can be right they have that on the record and then they feel less then and then when they get a job there hostage to that job because they're afraid to do the job for them\nAnd it's just bad bad bad so I said you know what\nI'm gonna do something I've been taken action my whole life and take action now too and we decided to start our own business I figured if we're in charge him with a ball says you can't fire such so we started on busy weekend trucker so became we had a small trucking company\nWho what did you know about but what did you know about business nothing as a matter of God Bless America\nDidn't matter what it was what I have a choice I allow my mother to be hostage or I Do something I what's my option go to business school was that what I was going to do a Latino right I'd have to walk I too often I don't\nI never I never happened never will ever measure any plan I have against perfection because perfection doesn't work I measure my plan against status quo because that has caused what I have\nStatus quo was my mother as a hostage I don't accept status quo so we start business is it well my my um it did well I actually left it let ... let her and my step dad run it and she ran until she retired and when she retired she they were too many New Yorkers do and that is leaving New York state and she went to South Carolina to retire\nUm so she did that and ... and she was fine until she passed away several years ago but after that that's when I went off to do my own thing I had made it for jobs and then decided you know what the first visible successful let me try another one so I thought it my second business and that's when I actually uh that when I did not do well and that's why I say we're not that's when I first\nHeard you back when you want your Philly station I'm In ... in the morning show\nOut of here yes that's when I first heard you doing your ah your jokes um about\nAn hour and a stand [laughter] I remember I remember I was I was I was driving around and and I was actually listen to you I think you can I Am\nIs that right yeah yeah and I am\nYes you when you get morning shower remember listening to back then and um then I did that and I sold that business office did not do as well as I wanted to be do but I was called at my MBA that failure was my MBA so I'm from that I didn't have one more job and then started this job now that this is now that I have which I'm a trainer consultant teacher\nSo I have large clients like a ... an essay laughter and smaller clients like small law firms I teach um leadership I'm exactly the coach at each business I've been an executive in a public company twice as a a band aid\nAnd I've taught many colleges have groups John J. and I've taught as a guest instructor at the graduate level of a Yale and Colombia\nAnd now I'm here but what have you done with your life seriously I Want to be a I'm a loser I'm Sorry\nI wholly as though you are a guy that\nTo me seems tailor made for the time that we live in I I mean I think Iraq Obama\nWas also in in some ways tailor made for the times that we live in and I don't think he lived up to his potential um the the more division happened um we we need somebody that can speak to all sides with a with credibility somebody who can speak to\nPrison reform with credibility and not an axe to grind but common sense and experience\nI mean this is the thing that I talk about all the time you know I've dealt with and seeing the prison system from both\nYou know both sides my father was Russia's off from my mother as as a felon and I say the same thing as I say in business and that is when you want to fix something you don't walk in and start dictating when you do that you get rebellion when you do that people say no\nThe issue that we have particularly in New York state but throughout the country is\nWe have to set a two sided thinking right as you said before a binary I either every corrections officers a thug and every single person there is a victim or every prisoner is evil and she'll be killed in every corrections officer is perfect\nAnd neither is true the reality of it is to fix this is the situation in prison we have to have the corrections officers as part of the solution and that's hard for people to understand because they think they are part of the system\nOcean and that's hard for people to understand if they think they're part assist them yes but they see people every day what I Know for sure in prison right now we have people in jail who should probably never get out ever what bad people she never got out\nAnd there are people who made a mistake should pay that society and then get a second chance and people probably shouldn't be in jail at all the issue is I don't know which one is which and I never will but you know who does\nCorrections officers who deal with them every day those are the people who deal with the inmates everyday\nHow do I know that could be true you look at Massachusetts right now they have the Humvee program which is a program that has CEOs corrections officers and volunteers from outside together with a specific community in this case the communities veterans but you can pick any community a community that that feels no they see in prison everyday\nYou make that happen all the time what happens you have people who had that problem coming as volunteers now is your tax money you also have corrections officers who knows how to control people know which people who can get in there no those who will be scanning and well now the those who are scanning and we'll put the people who need to have the rights the right the second chat out\nThere in his program how do we know that the recipient right in Massachusetts in general is about Seventy five percent\nWith this program less than five percent holy do\nYes no no specialized people coming in corrections officer into it here's the problem in New York state specifically the corrections officers ... the the ... the life expectancy is fifty eight years that ... years old not just that every corrections officer I've met either know someone who committed suicide\nAnd or a knows someone who is so ready to leave they had become completely apathetic to assist them\nThis is a problem all of them to have the same thing Larry you know I'm I'm already there that therapists I'm already there that marriage Calif I'm already they're legal assistant already help them out with all kinds of things I'm already trying to help them\nThere are so many CEOs who would happily ship into this world without having to change any of that ad anybody but giving them an actual contract they haven't had a contract for three years in the upstate that's how bad it is\nSo we could actually fix things this is terrible if we actually use both sides and\nGo in and asked the people who are there how to fix it that's how you are in the business that's how you fix it life\nDelivery do you have time can I hold you for a while could select sure okay ah I Want to take a break 'cause I I Want to talk to you about the economy I Want to talk to you about business sure are and you know the direction of California where they've they've just a mandated that you know women now have to be on the board of directors\nOr that we're going to completely bizarre a a direction and I would love to hear how you think you could make\nNew York a a\nA more of a same place Larry sharp he's running for governor a as a libertarian a and I'm telling you if you were looking for a candidate in a New York you could play the same game where you can try something different\nI Want you to listen to Larry sharp if you're in New York or it will be back\nWith him in just

Republicans\nAnd we have Seventy percent of New Yorkers who actually don't vote this is actually learned helplessness it's an issue where people are saying it doesn't matter in fact most New Yorkers if you ask them they're thinking about leaving the state we have over a hundred thousand leaving every single year over a million up left in the past eight years\nYou know I Will judge my term ... by a very simple number and that is are there still are a hundred thousand New Yorkers leaving every year if so I failed if not I'm winning I'm a business guy and customers matter\nAnd that's the governor of my customers my population and my drawing people into my state or I might pushing them away and right now we're pushing them away that's what's happening right now the Democrats have basically run out of state and the statewide level for about sixteen years give or take so if they were going to fix this state they would have already fixed it\nThe Republicans they've been watching this for sixteen years so my question to any Republican is where's their plan\nBack to Larry sharp I have to tell you I was living in New York and I was a Republican I Can't I cannot imagine a

York how would you change it\nWe have to rebuild it from the bottom up I mean it is totally completely broken we dropped twenty two thousand dollars per kid and that basket mediocre results\nAnd the first thing is ending standardized testing until high school no sound like that's going to Alaska satellites testing is unfair way way upgrading teachers and unfair way of rewarding schools it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve who don't test will feel stupid and creates a second class of students in\nElementary school that's embarrassingly bad and\nIt's absolutely no indication success in life for the future that has to go away but when that goes away a couple of things happen in New York state Common Core will go away good I don't have a problem with in common core go away\nI'm the only guy who says let teachers teach and then does not administrators I'm the only does that my goal is to remove administrators to allow teachers to actually teach we have school districts in New York state where there are more diminished writers and teachers that's embarrassing\nSo once we do that we'll find all of a sudden ... be able to get rid of a lot of administrators an average teacher in New York state makes about eighty K. the average administration makes over six figures\nYou get rid of to administrators that's either two new teachers or raises over a quick meant and what point earlier I don't decide what that is the school district does they know what they need and they can repair how they want to repair\nHow you deal with the unions are the unions a New Yorker out of control\nThe with the Janice decision it helps obviously but the issue here it becomes I'm not anti union in any way shape or form the union leadership hates me because there are stylish meant workers love me because I'm the only one to tell them I Would negotiate openly\nTransparently with every union unions are literally in the first amendment they are free speech sure Oscar of association you\n... as long as they're not forced to join another prompt the middle the ... members loved me so that's why teachers always behind me\nAnd I'm I was asking you about the unions are in such control that you're paying the state is paying for teachers that have that of abuse children and yet they are sitting in rubber rooms\nAnd that's my point once once most of that is happening because of both Albany and D.C control and Albany and easy money from DC we get about four billion dollars every year and that controls a locked\nWhen that money begins to go away number one that will help the second thing is I'm not holding to union leadership if they get mad at me so what you\nDidn't leaderships not going to vote for me anyway I don't eat Seventy percent of New York's the vote for me I Need thirty percent of those who vote\nYou just said forty four billion dollars goes away from the federal government that is correct how are you going to we're going to replace that with\nAbsolutely and the first thing is we're going to lose administrators what you make things a little bit better but that isn't enough the second thing I Want to change K. through twelve K. through twelve she got access she'd be K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is\nYou know Jim study hall or playing video games it's it's doing nothing how do we know this the first year of

your high school prom if you pass the test done\nNow you have several options option one if\nYou think ... a a college is good for you also go to go to a very good to eat prep school to get you into the school you walk so now you're ready to get that at school you can get that you take advantage of incubator as a of internships maybe graduate in three years and now you're rocking and rolling\nYou don't like that no worries the super smart kid the kid that test well awesome take your safety at sixteen stock your path of your doctorate right away get a two year degree by doing that by Eighteen

nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety and the toll free add one aid for four to nine\nTwelve fifty John how are you today is fine there an hour you fantastic what do we have on the docket to talk about in a while we wait for some calls here\nOh well uh I Want to do uh we're gonna talk and then later in the program about how to buy a used car\n\nOr shopping for a used cars going on and treasure on oh yeah there are amazing deals out there and with the emergence of the Internet as a car shopping tool\nYou have every chance to find a good deal on a card that meet your needs and set your budget the trick is you've got to know what you're looking for a while we're going to get to that there's ten items in this list that we need to get to\nBut yeah there are plenty of incentives to buy a used instead of a new car was saving money on car insurance save money on registration save money on taxes and depreciation which is the last in cars valued due to wear and tear overtime\nIt also makes sense because cars I've never\nBeen more reliable ... it's not unusual for some vehicles to be troubled free for well over a hundred thousand miles\nAwhile back to have that the cash for clunkers program and I had a few friends in my home town that we're just complaining left and right because you couldn't get a a garbage car for two hundred dollars anymore after that the prices went up for a while but now they've started to come back down to the cars that are left are much more reliable\nUh yes although the um after market world there are so hot riders were really dismayed at that cash for clunkers program\nIt was an unintended side effect but it did get a lot of polluters off the road\nYes it did remove polluters I didn't have a problem with that but then they're haste to remove them they not only removed and they destroyed them mhm which meant that there were do you parse left around for the current sleep that was out there of course you need to have to go buy new\nWell not having an said things have leveled out a little bit more in the intervening years\nDo it really depends on the uh a warranty that you're looking for on the transmission\nOkay ... well you know we are now will already a rebuild from I'm\nJoe's transmission shock uh they're they're under federal mandate and if they rebuild your transmission to give you a twelve twelve\nYeah yeah okay some shops are given twenty four twenty four and most of the ... or ... or rebuilt transmissions that we use a have a three year thirty a hundred thousand mile warranty a voice\nTwenty four twenty four and most of the ... or ... or rebuilt transmission is that we use a have a three year thirty a hundred thousand mile warranty\nOh boy [laughter] what shops which place are you talking about when you're when you're saying that you use ... recommendation for a good brand name for rebuilt transmission is sure to order\nA well ah for the root rebuild we use Jasper\nJasper okay now right now down\nA and a lot of times we'll use oh we will buy 'em from the dealership\nFrom the dealer so focused right\nAll right I'm well thank you very much for your time sir thank you for the phone call appreciate talk or you have a very nice very luck\nOn drive safe yes as and drive safe\nOr stay dry I think it's getting to get wet [laughter] or back to buying a car he already did it and you might have saved himself\nSome trouble by having it tested but I'm not in the last he sounds like he's doing okay\nI'm choose the right car you got to choose the right car you just can't get something to look you now the fun begins picking your car takes them time to think about how you plan to use the car\nFor example if you have a family you won enough room for everyone plus apple cargo space his safety is a top priority check out the insurance Institute of highway safety for crash tests\nYeah ... you know you want to know how it rates you don't want to buy the one that's at the bottom of the list\nOr one of those ones with the mentally airbags\nWell you're going and that's going to be kind of hard to avoid man I did that whole program on to cocker ... to pick out an airbag\nAlthough what would it would it be but it's probably further down the list to ask the previous owner is hey did you ah get on that airbag recall\nAnd get it done ... uh yeah and he recalls a that that later on we'll talk about getting history ... on the vehicle asked why I asked this gentleman about uh if if he knew if the transmission of Ben exchange or the ... sixties for our ladies were not seen living\nMuch beyond a hundred and fifty thousand miles so I\nGotta feeling that he's he doesn't have transmission failure yet but he's been spending I think he's he's looking down the gauntlet of it yes I think that is friend in Prescott sounds like it'd be you'll be get hooked up they're pretty good\nNarrow the field by making a list that must have features that search for models that have those seizures using tools such as car finder on Edmunds\nOr as you move forward build a list of three target car models to research in more detail\nDo an electric windows of still come as an option or is that pretty much standard at this point you'd have to pay more for the crank\nA walk there again depends on the type of car you're buying a I Know I'm a I'm not sure about the floors I Know when they GM's\nUh the trucks for a long time if you bought what they called the W T the work truck are they still came very plain Jane was just crank up windows for quite a while but uh boy by golly a hollow window regulators I've been replaced in the last five six seven eight years\nSeems like just about every car comes with the power windows ... than the other thing moving on as we go along\nSurprise I even remember those\nOr we're going to move on here to check reliability and ownership cost\nThat's another good area to look in every used cars different some have been driven more miles and have more wear and tear\nBut in general you want to make sure you're using your choosing models known for their dependability\nA Consumer Reports and shady powers collect maintenance reports\nFrom owners and rate all used cars so you can go online and checked with the uh uh had various Consumer Reports or consumer report and shady powers on a specific vehicle you are looking for and you get a kind of get a feeling\nA for what the the the horror stories that people have to tell about that particular vehicle\nUh I got a Saturn and I ended up putting more money into it than I spent the bio that I can make fun of sat on because they don't exist anymore\n[laughter] so yeah we can do the same thing with archery Pontiac too but that don't count I have this darn [laughter] Sunni Baker [laughter] is that I Love and they called in my childhood stupid Baker [laughter] it wasn't fair though they were there actually good cars\nOr a comparison but some examples we've seen now a days certainly\nAre closely ... related issues total cost of ownership\nThey ... related issues total cost of ownership\nSome cars are cheap to buy but will cost you a lot of money in the long run because of the insurance\nMaintenance repair and depreciation ah we've seen this at the shop a fact just a few weeks ago we had a gentleman and what they a Mercedes\nAlways fun well yeah in early one or the early nineties\nOr wasn't in the best of shape or he didn't do any of that free by work it was just somebody who is selling one and it was cheap so he was getting into the luxury class for no money\nOh boy I'm ... I'm Still until he found out what\nIt costs to actually for prayer Mercedes Benz or a wise and a happy camper at that point\nAnd and and looked at us with John does because he thought we we were just jerk and he's leg or something\nAnd you know all your price do I I mean that sometimes that's where that reputation come from but if you want to do 'em right uh we work on them and they're not cheap no they're they're more money than other vehicles and you get into that with the\nWas it doesn't matter labor or parts or all of the above all of the above\nA two lanes different to access into computers different uh a lot of the parts if you want the car to live you're gonna have to buy dealership parts we parts and I can tell you right now\nReceive bans and BMW we're very proud of their parts [laughter]\nOkay\nSo anyway ah continue on there with a check reliability and ownership cost several automotive website says she's Kelley Blue book and five year cost to own or Consumer Reports costs that vehicle\nOwnership show estimates of these expenses\nAre where we have we got plenty of time we can go on to locating a good used car now that that could be a challenge there are a lot of websites the list used cars and each site seems have its own character here are for good ones to check out\nWe'll start with Craig's list\nThis cyclists used cars for free it's best for low in cars in your area\nBut be careful about scanners\nOh yeah plus the other benefit of Craig's list is no matter what you're searching for you'll probably end up with a car in the list\nYeah I it's kind of like e bay yeah oh yeah I wouldn't know how you can find a car on E. bay but I wouldn't recommend going there and I think if they read on the age of Craig's list workers they're geographically\nPlaced a unlike e bay or ... national yeah Craig's list you look up by county\nAnd usually you can determine whether that's a reasonable driving distance or not\nYeah I wouldn't want to start with the the the Dallas Fort Worth area or if it'll hurt or planning on\nHere and there are if this used cars going to be your uh first car in a while walking distance [laughter]\nWow yeah you you could you could search the ad on Craig's list 'cause you'll have an idea they generally have a map shows you exactly where in the cars that\nAre the next one would be auto trader uh there again they are a geographically located\nA a little broader a with in the sense that they all have a\nSouthern California northern California which did could still be ... not a really close but it's at least it's in the same state\nAnd the other benefit as you're not going to suddenly come up with a votes or red wine red Ryder wagon instead of just a car right\nA auto trader here sellers fatalist their vehicles paid sites are better at keeping an eye scammers and usually provided list of mid and high end cars\nSome barrier to entry helps called the chapel a little bit\nI trade are also allows you to easily filtered by year make bottle and price range and features so that that's a plus for auto trader a moving on we've got Otto list\nThis site is an aggregator it pulls together information for many different areas into one searchable site\nThe only issue with that as those are not always as reliable based on how they gather the information you have to do a little bit more ah research if you find something you like\nYou're still working with the base twenty Fifteen Nissan Sentra\nA auctions add to the cars value there are special fishers installed when the car is built such as the navigation system\nOr if you have a tape player over an eight track player that'll be something\nYeah [laughter] are a printing and sound and the GM she can get the bows and that kinda thing mileage typical annual mileage on cars about twelve thousand miles here that if a car's been driven more or less than is the prices adjusted accordingly\nBeen driven more or less than is the prices adjusted accordingly\nAnd the condition level\nRated description of the condition levels carefully the difference between clean and now standing for example could easily mean Fifteen hundred dollars and the price of the vehicle\nSo um go ahead and get one of those handheld vacuums [laughter]\nMost pricing guys give you several different prices if you're buying a car from a dealer\nLook at the dealer retail price if your next door neighbor is the seller you should look at the private party price you might also noticed that pricing guys tell you what the car is worth\nAs a trade in which is always going to be a little bit lower generally quite a bit lower [laughter] make sure to pressure current car if you plan to traded in at the dealership\nAnd from our experience it's always been better to try to sell your car on the open market and deal with whoever you're dealing with\nWith cash you can get your best you'll end up getting the best of both worlds Jim duffel bag or cashier's check whichever way you're feeling and getting back to this guy's a submarine topic\nCheck the vehicle fishery report\nAnd before you drive across town to see a car you're interested in running vehicle history report using the vehicles then number a which is right there in the lower\nWindshield on the driver's side in the corner or on the door\nWhen you open the door and look for the latches there's generally a tag in there to as at all so\nUm\nAnd make sure that the door matches the car [laughter] yes [laughter] and I want to door off another car or both of those numbers should match anyway\nBut anyway check or get the number in some cases online classified will have linked to free vehicle his reports if not it's worth it to buy one hair or some of the port information you'll learn\nThose this car have claimed title not ours is there a a lean over on the type if a car's men in serious accident\nFire or flood and was told by the insurance company declared that that does that mean it was declared a total loss\nThis film ivy drivable however the insurance company will issue a salvage titles to alert future buyers steer clear of cars a salvage trial because it kills the resale value and the car might still have hidden problems\nEspecially with all the electrical them they're very very very much so I unless somebody can give you a a a you know there's nothing that prevents them as somebody from rebuilding that car\nToo good status yeah but there again that's up to you to test drive the car we haven't got to that part yet but you should take it to a map mechanics you trust and having this car checked out\nStemmed stern uh we do that at auto talk uh we have a couple of programs there we have to call a casual observation mainly walk around the car we look for any kind of damage\nOr we we look over the uh [noise] engine in areas are at the tires\nTo see if there's any alignment or suspension issues a\nLook at the floods what kind of condition they're in\nAnd then Jen generally just a many years experience and knowledge site sounds and smell of the car we can give you a it looks okay er and needs to be looked at further or that one we don't charge an arm and a leg for I Believe we get like Seventy five dollars for that one uh we do have a full\nComplete inspection where we actually wrecked a car and scurry over from stemmed stern and we also get into the computer and scurry it stemmed stern to not only to see if they're just any trouble quotes listed but to make sure that all of the parameters are within\nOperating ...\nBest vacations we want to see 'em in the middle we won't go don't want to go in there and see something operate right at the end where about ready to fail or is going to set a trouble code that would end up costing you money soon\nBut sometimes you know that was one of the weird things I realized after I moved to Arizona\nIs that there's no law that\nDictates of I mean to be done once a year I came from a state where every year you had to have the car inspected gotta stick or you're ready to go I'm while you're you know what your status is for the coming year\nWell that's a that's a there's nothing wrong with that program but it's a state safety inspections yes okay I have all that safety inspections does is make sure the park and stop that the windshield wipers for it and then all the lights function as purported and you don't have a crack windshield oh yeah so it's it's a good ...\nAnd they don't charge extra for it but again that's a based on what you can get but that's not the case here yeah to do a bit of your own volition and yes and that's again staying on top of it make it through you have your maintenance done and trying to keep a notebook if you want to be super responsible about it\nAnyway we'll go back there where the insurance company solar cars yep serious accidents are reported to the insurance company and will probably be beyond the vehicle history report shady car last why spend the dominant her back to increase it selling price\nThe vehicle his report can alerts you to this scam 'cause it also tells you what my that was when that report was may and if it happens to be less now ... ... oh yeah\nI'm also I and the reports I've seen a when title transfers uh say the cars been solved two or three times every time the titles transferred there's they mileage report given on it\nIt's nice to think that you're at the car your interest in was driven by the driven to church by a little old lady for his entire life that's not always the case if you order report you know for sure each time has changed hands\nOn again this is a good credit collided develop when I'm looking at us guards\nAre we going to take another quick break here on live in a local in the

P. show say good morning to our radio Partridge\nNumber three hundred and thirty six cities around America direct TV the audience network that channel two thirty nine\nAnd the NBC Sports network will talk some baseball will set the plate set the scene Harold Reynolds from the baseball network will join us coming up and about Fifteen minutes we'll recap college football could Notre Dame go undefeated during the regular season\n[noise] had forty from Yahoo Sports will join his and Troy Aikman hall of famer we'll recap\nYesterday's action and preview tonight sheep's Broncos with Patrick ... homes go join is coming up in the final hour the show NFL fans can't get enough football right but there is one exception I'm not sure how we all feel about over time right now\nThere were three overtime games on Sunday and none of them fortunately ended in touch but all three could have we've already had two types of the season and the drama and the extra period is because of eight twenty twelve rules change the receiving team can't win with a field goal on the first Dr of overtime\nAnd overtime he's now ten minutes you used to be Fifteen minutes at ties very much in play because of the ten minutes instead of Fifteen minutes because chances are you might get a possession and the opponent gets a possession as well\nYou had the colds go full ten minutes on Sunday they have a quick turnaround they've got the patriots Thursday nights of good luck with that and it's in New England\nPeople are always going to have a problem with overtime because\nIf we start to see more times than watch out that means more rule changes could be coming for a policy that the NFL will probably never be able to perfect because we look at college football\nAnd you see there's excitement in their overtime there's high scores in their over time you get off in ... in your over time and this is what the NFL wants right\nThey want more often I'm looking at the passing numbers and this was something I'm gonna bring up what Troy Aikman a little bit later on the number of four hundred yards passing games it used to be unheard of\nYou have it maybe five\nEight times in season now it feels like it's every week a couple of times a week you're thrown for four hundred yards it's not a big deal you know\nWhen you're rushing for a hundred yards that's the exception that the anomaly that's the aberration where you go and he ran for a hundred yards huh wow good for him\nIt used to be you always had a one hundred yard running back now with each passing the rules or up you know lack there of\nEverybody's putting up these big numbers and this is what the NFL wants that's why I'm curious where we're headed\nWhen it comes to overtime because it feels like the NFL would maybe adopt the college football overtime rule and just say you know what I have some fun here I don't know what that does the fantasy because that's another problem that I have when you see a guy go he threw seven touchdown passes\nWell wait you through to during regulation yeah and then he lit up and over time they're\nHearing some numbers to think about recent history of four hundred yards passing games\nIn twenty four teen the entire season we had eleven four hundred yards passing performance the entire year eleven\nTwenty Fifteen ten the entire year\nTire your eleven twenty Fifteen ten the entire year twenty sixteen twelve twenty Seventeen only eight four hundred yard parenting good so far through sixty two games this season we've had twelve\nWe've had more through sixty two games than we did in any of the entire pre a previous four seasons\n[noise] can't hit the passer can touch the wide receiver it just feels like you won on the fence you're gone off ... is it too much on offense will ever be too much office and will we ever get to the point where we say you don't want on second thought would it be nice if we let the defense actually played some defense\nWhere you can hit how you can hit how high how low\nPretty amazing but this was what the NFL's unleashed on you and it feels like ... once you open the door it's rare when they go you're on second thought were going to let the defense put their hands on you more than five yards down the field\nOr you know what we're actually going to let you hit the quarterback or you know what we're going to change there's rule to help you a little bit not that anybody is going hey why I'd like to see some more defense but does it get to the point where it's silly\nDrew Brees is going to set the all time passing record next Monday Night the saints host the Washington Redskins\nAnd you know good for ... because he played he doesn't miss games he plays in a high level but you wonder what these pouncing numbers mean if you're a quarterback now what kind of numbers aside from Super Bowls do you have to put up to be home and fame quarterback\nYou know and looking at Troy Aikman Troy wouldn't be nowhere near the whole thing without three superbowls nowhere near but he won three superbowls the only way you're getting in and if you don't have at least fifty thousand your inches you've won at least one maybe two Super Bowls and probably have to lean towards two Super Bowl\nBecause fifty thousand yards [laughter] that's pedestrian\nDrew Brees is going to end up with perhaps eighty thousand pouncing yards when it's all said and done because I think he's got a chance to play longer than Tom Brady\nFive hundred touchdown pass used\nTo be you've got the three hundred touchdown passes I remember ... and for years like I Would know the staff three hundred and ten passing touchdown right thinking who would ever get to three hundred\nNow yeah three hundred he managed got three hundred apple checking the stats Matt Stafford alliance he should have fifty thousand before the age of thirty three\nAnd Stafford could end up with the most passing yards in history by the way the lines they should be arrested for those uniforms\nThose were terrible like can you be more drab blah plane what was that like a light gray high disappointed\nOr achieving graze the Benjamin says hundreds even grade [laughter]\nAll righty uh

guy you know Mitch real true best ski violent looked like ... or ... we like to call and finally looked like a I first round draft pick anyone against a pretty good chance of defense or at least you thought it was a pretty good Tampa defense\nOr you know what speaking of that and he had an unbelievable performance is the greatest passing performance you'll ever have in Chicago their history\nAnd I really feel like if the rams played in Chicago they'd be a crappy often it always feels like often says go to Chicago and they just die here is dirt cutter the Tampa Bay head coach after the law
