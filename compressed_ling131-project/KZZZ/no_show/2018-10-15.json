points venturing for these people to call them and plead their case and fill out the proper fake or they don't seem to understand that but they certainly understand\nHow much of what to say and how to get in here illegally but my my feeling is that they have no respect for our our\n... and how many cases Chris there are a lot of their relatives are already here illegally\nAnd they've been here for years\nSo the relatives call 'em up and said just get get here and you'll be able to stay they're not going to deport you get here\nMight as well\n... second cousin twice removed ... uncle aunt or adult children could get it come on I mean they're they're not going to send you home if you don't violate the law once you're here\nAnd even that you might be able to stay\nSo I mean people know what's happening here and they're taking advantage of it I mean it doesn't surprise me at all if people knew when they got to the border gets what you're not going to come in and just because you bring a child doesn't mean you're going to be protected\nYou will be sent back immediately we need immediate border turned backs even to non contiguous countries that have to happen\nEight five five

thousand to get through Mexico somebody's paying for them and they're down trodden people so\nYeah I don't we don't know who's paying for some in some cases and you've heard stories of this people traffic themselves\nThey they actually traffic themselves they pay a debt to the human traffickers with our own bodies\nSome of them as a border agents told us on the angle last uh last February and march some of them just abandon their own kids in the desert they just leave their kids there or they leave their kids\nOr where it with a border patrol agent and run\nThat's happened to\nMost now though no they can just stay with their kids so as long as they have a child or a miner or someone who's related in some way\nThey'll be able to say and then they're released and then they don't have to come back for hearing this is a way to destroy their country it's a way and if we have a country three hundred and ten million people\nOne in five births in the United states today according to that story that we saw last week is to an immigrant twenty percent\nAnd we have twenty million at least illegal immigrants in the country are\nAnd when you know the dock of people who are here the uh other people who are we're allowed to stay from El Salvador and hurricanes mudslides\nThe temporary protected status that that the president thought to undo\nThat that the president thought to undo\nThey've been here for decades and many of them have children so we have our stupid birthright citizenship which we also have to get rid of huge problem\nBut I've been a broken record on us I Know I'm On my board with my own comments about this because I've sent them so many times let's go to Scott in Arizona it's got go ahead\nLaura what I'm Talking about his support\nOf order farmer in Tucson who have cameras that was posted on reporters just thousands of people crossing the border as well as cartel fully fully armed up Jemma Florence ... bottom you know black bottle so they don't get caught\nIt was just like and they see this but no one knows anything about it this poor farmer finally put up all these cameras saying look I'm tired of it\nI think it was someone do something [noise]\nOur Congress is letting our people down ... we know the Democrats\nAre just going to welcome in more of it but why should Republicans be standing by allowing this to happen you have the house in the Senate now\n[noise] do something about it so you lose the house you get nothing you can have nothing when it's going to have a a wholesale invasion of the United states going to keep going\nMore and more and more and then you have all these we the reports on MSNBC they don't do the Wi Fi reports on the victims of violent crime by legal immigrants they don't do those stories but they do the weeping story in South of the border of all these people are sitting on the concrete with their kids playing with you know a paper doll\nAnd you the people are supposed to have your heartstrings completely\nUh polled by the emotional manipulation of the American media they're emotionally manipulating\nI Can't stand that time kind of reporting it's the easiest kind of reporting to do and it's the most\nDishonest let's go to Paul in Virginia very quickly Paul\n... build the wall is going to go down as Trump's you keep your doctor is done nothing\nOn his border here he has failed miserably I don't care about Korea or trade deals or anything he let this continue on this country is not we're never going to get anybody elected you're going to have the Elizabeth Warren\nAnd the brokers and everybody'd be elected in this country he is killing his country by not floppy he's to put the military on the other side of the border and stop that\nWell I think a lot of people agree with you and you see these you see this massive invasion imagine if the people\nWho claimed to be reporters were actually reporting on this like really reporting on it not just talking to the the the Seventeen year old who has two or three kids is a poor person I get that they're desperate people I Do understand\nWe ... we feel for the people who are being manipulated and hurt into making this track\nBut we are Americans first we must must protect our border otherwise adios America\nIf you suffer from eating and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nWhat if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came off patent December eleventh in that scene active ingredient that's in the little blue pills no available and generic form available to you from just thirty dollars for a month supply that's a big discount no more getting ripped off of the big pharma companies with for him dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy does it and see huge money on your prescription ... just go to\nVoters people who are legally allowed to vote in this country to come out and my race I mean that's just not something that we should be\nUm accepting as citizens and she's also saying I'm going to raise your taxes abolish all the things that the left at putting forward and it's a frightening prospect for the people of Georgia a brain ... would be a much better choice and he does have a slim lead and I'm hoping he will pull it out\nI think again this is about the future of America a we have Elizabeth Warren of course the great progressive savior and the Democrat Party are coming out today with the DNA test a where she claims that she does have [laughter]\nAncestry a of a Native American sort a initially reports where that she could be one thirty seconds Native American but now there's a there's a there's now a Boston Globe\nQuestion about whether it's really like one one thousand given the math of how far removed her Native American ancestry could be yeah here it goes the report includes the possibility that she's just one one thousand twenty fourth Native American\nOn one thousand twenty four is Native American they just put that correction on the Boston Globe door\nYeah I mean I I'll tell you one thing she is a hundred percent not qualified to be our president where she would take our country it's frightening\nA and it's interesting to see that she's running for Senate in Massachusetts this signals to the people of Massachusetts as clearly as possible she's running for president so she's saying here give me another term as senator but I'm going to go run for president and walk away from the Senate seat as quickly as possible so\nUm I Would love for the president to go up against Elizabeth why I Can't think of a better contrast bring it on\nThe boroughs like ... by this joke and if you if you say you\nYou know your part Austrian and and goes back and generations you get to claim nobility status and the Austrian author Hungarian empire I mean this is this really what we're going to do now to get special privileges and colleges and universities I think this is what drives people crazy\nAnd it's offensive to Native Americans I mean it just is so ... and she doesn't apologize to them for you know capitalizing on their true heritage for her her benefit and and that's really the bottom line of this that she's push that forward for benefit for her career\nFor her education and what she's one one thousand\nTo ... [laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny now Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before it took off for Florida let's listen to\n\n\nA ... no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the white\nHouse lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now that are graphs have left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it\nBecause Democrats keeps saying free health care free that's free everything and they're not saying this well quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like\nIn this midterm election cycle with the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like the ... he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game and place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did\nIn twenty sixteen to turn out our vote to educate voters to talk about the results I there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think you're gonna have recounts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is is breaking our way uh in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with my run I mean the energy in the Senate sites great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in mid term of a first term president so I feel good about where we are Kavanaugh has definitely energized our base and I've seen that in our mail I'm singing are fundraising\nAll across the board it has put a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are offering obstruct resist\nThe smear campaign the search and destroy it all costs or do we really want\nA party that's putting forward results that are helping average American families\nAre run up before we let you go the uh the word that in reporting that there is yet another care of on the Caribbean or two or three caravan\nOf migrants are coming from Guatemala and Honduras making their way through Mexico to the U.S southern border um my listeners are enraged by this they want they stopped they want this Congress to make\nA make it clear that we can do a media turn back to new legislation at the border stopping new application of asylum at border entry points instead of doing it in your home country of what what are you asking the Republican Party to do to stop this this madness\nI mean we do know wall and now we have more people just flooding into the country\nNow we have more people just flooding into the country\nOr the president has let on S. and you've you've heard signals from the Senate and the house it they're going to look at funding for the wall during the race or during the time between that's election in January they should I mean I think about what these kids are going through these poor children are being\nDragged across Mexico to our border they're being put in very dangerous situations oftentimes when they come in to the United states there last\nWeek the human trafficking crop on this is something that Democrats should be working with the president to solve they don't um and it's got to take Republican leadership to step up and solve this immigration problem we have a serious problem at our borders and we have to resolve it\nYou know we have to resolve it and of course everyone's heart breaks for the children who are as you said put in danger by taking this long track\nA but the American children the American people homeless veterans inner city America they need the attention of our lawmakers first and foremost have to take care of our own people who opioids everything else that we've seen a develop the last Twenty years we have a lot on our plate\nA and we expect this Congress to do the right thing and in in this in this madness because it is madness at this point or Ron we really appreciate your joining us thank you so much and congrats on the on the ... from the president he has a lot of confidence in you and that's a big testament to everything that you've done at this point\nThank you thanks for having me it's an honor to serve such a great presidents are some\nThat are on a thanks so much trying to

about eight minutes of\nI'm I'm Sorry they're not the yeah they are they argue buddy mental fascism in America in in defense of the frontline officers of the Portland the they're under orders but I've railed against the upper echelon of these police agencies\nSoftness with which they're handling and tougher and when that shows up they show up prepared for battle they're not counter demonstrators they're not counter protesters they aren't insurgency group an anarchist group and a police state to be more sort of early on\nTo keep the peace to defend life to keep their officers safe and it's not really going on wants to crap hits the fan so to speak or then it's too late so\nI think the different strategy of more of a circus strategy by the Portland pd and all throughout the United states is necessary because we are at this stage no and I I've been seeing this for two or three months using the term political violence of people on the lips up and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not no it's on\nAnd this I'm a patriot prayer group that was holding their rallied and they had one a couple of months ago an anthem flipped at the same damn thing they showed up prepared\nFor battle they start fights they like conflict and like I said a the police are there to keep the peace not let the stuff happens not been but don't break those are failed strategies\nAnd until they make it clear with a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protest because\nAntics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protest because this is not protest and I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentator is I'm not talking about you but there are commentators are on the right who continued to refer to what\nAn to fund some of this other political violence is when they're shouting down a and intimidating people in a restaurant they keep calling a protest it's not protests hit is insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully in to the government\nNow and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation uh\nIt's it's a type of of political extortion too when they do it to the senators and in the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why is this even allowed in the hall to the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to\nTo get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them\nIn the in the halls of the uh the capital and that should be allowed\nRight and let's see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators than another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group a in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to\nThat we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I can tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do what I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view turning the other cheek\nTaking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness in like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on the hit this is designed to\nIntimidate and incite fear and people to get them to alter their their votes for public policy that's why I'm calling this political violence it's gone on for too long it's gone on too far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is good I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I studied to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those soft masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and then we I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law enforce\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border\nOr so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Donna Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nResistance that about ... [laughter] about people who do not want the health care about women who want to be listening to when they feel that it's time to talk about the problem of sexual assault there is not about mobs\nThat were running it maybe that's what it would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV or talking about is talking about in Kentucky where Kavanaugh painting Donald Trump and the resistance is taking the feel I agree with Rick Silva mob\nI eerie action to that\nSame I've done in Brazil you know but I'm Still I'm not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said the stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it up when I hear of people like her and I hear others not denounced\nThe violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage\nShe saw the backlash when she came out with her book that really took the or the DNC the Democratic party to task\nAnd she saw the filter blowback realized she'd better scurry back on the plantation and that's what she did at the end of her her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate\nMe those type of leadership we call this crap all for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do Laura's you know a tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do say anything like they try to make that well it's not a mom it's really about health care no it's not just trying to to frame of narrative\nAnd a ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they try to ah when they're forced I should say to say that anti ... and some of these other goons this I'm a feminist movement when they're pulling their crap\nYou know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence just tacit approval to this political violence\nA and sheriff Clarke before we let you go ah the Democrat Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia\nSaying that they represent both documented and undocumented um people in this country and let the whole bunch of other groups they claim to represent a and now we have this\nThe groups they claimed to represent a and now we have this it's mad\nA crash about to happen again on the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with the children\nBy this is dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on their stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and what citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges that are in the constitution\nOr belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing\nThe the the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nAnd again I'm this Congress must work with the president both on the wall\nAnd of course allowing for immediate turned backs at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening\nAnd it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America into this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there no one's in there and no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment truce it really is\nA terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThis elite is broken uh immigration system to\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that the people are proposing follows sealing the border because if you don't steal the border\nWe just saw last week where some guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen of beating has been deported six times lore six we've heard stories of people who've been caught that have\nBeen deported thirty times that's not a made up number but\nThe ... the borders so poor or easily or they can easily get back and so now it's a matter of\nUm you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know if we're going to maintain the house I I I Hope when I say we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're not going to fix this immigration system they're going to give

October Fifteen you're listening to the climax program\nAcademic grievance studies and the corruption of scholarship part one introduction\nSomething has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship base less upon finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and there are scholars increasingly the bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot um they learn something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really Dr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he is a thinker which I like a\nDoctorate in math or background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nHow good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into the field to find out\nWhether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments or that they might be willing to publish those so long as they thought the fell in line with the political views\nThat they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted\nA you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers\nA back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone it literally Thanksgiving a day or are we really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated\nThey call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship then so there are two things that are needed\nTo to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you have to do it according to their rules you you have to understand the concepts you're working with\nAnd present them knowledgeably and then\nYou also have to navigate this kind of matrix of offense based rules that stand in place of what a Santa places that are the academic rigor you would expect in a in a ... you know more serious field\nSaving energy saves you money and learn more energy savers dot Gov brought to you by the U.S department of energy and the ad council\nMy savings are gone OK where did you ask them [noise] I was home then I spent the one that vacation in this tiny suit of armor [noise] now they're gone weird\nSpirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted\nAnd reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized a yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial being particularly exciting paper must be published\nAnd congratulated the author on the research done and in the\nWriter a and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was that low to the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process they're very specific comments from dozens\nReviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review insane specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous are amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers it got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this is fine I says a lot and it's disturbing but the reviewers comments shows that the\n... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of completely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we did it and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised eyebrow about how ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we\nCan indicate that we're human about dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ... ... thing of another dog whether or not the dogs they got hump wanted or not because how could\nWe know that as being a non ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little video we put out to announce the project\nThey're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um [noise]\nAnd laying out [laughter] so what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... the ... what I mean\nYou got me ma'am\n[laughter] then it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office [laughter] okay\nUm let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nAre the the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd they say that that's not true is\nTo be mean to fat people fat phobic as they call it ... and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who we claimed growth that paper he actually has a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this paper for fat body building was just kind of hilarious\n[laughter] me [laughter] but that's another thing to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean\nSome of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean those kind of a this is a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on merit not on who did it and so\nA lot of people are are making that point and we deliberately chosen names that would be hard to find in a Google Search in a district which was very common names on purpose\nAll events is a really complicated I'm there will be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom he got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics courses I guess the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff\nThis is the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff who would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journal this wasn't some fringe of journal and education this was the gold standard than is philosophy journal hype Asia\nThat we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist which you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh but they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudice some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they launder them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we face this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell\nA truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem [noise]\nTeams one of the other ones they've found um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two in each ... each one in nature wage too was was accepted can you explain the explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that paycheck stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was a ballot writing academic hoaxes that code namely gay for convenience boy they argue is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will drop that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's\nA privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge in the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it introduced the concept in twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody was privilege is in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges Clinton question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because of privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there we just took him to step further\nAnd then ... and it's interesting guy because the one about hoaxes is interesting in that is to ... to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah and it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ...\nTo stand by the paper that they accept it and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest in all feminist them will need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I could we could one more to go on and on you talked on the scary front at the feminist mine come a\nWell you also did the white man my income if you did to one that I'm In his was accepted in the white man wasn't\nRight correct correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on and hurt the state's her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and they was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position is the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white\nWas was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just as like a whole bunch of saying then that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replaced the words Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism check and things like that so yeah that was a\nCheck and things like that so yeah that was a it started with scanning through mine comp picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white miss ... than\nEditing around it uh the feminist one didn't do it quite the same way the feminist one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it with with men for example it actually is a chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party is chapter twelve and what its members would be expected\nTo a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to the Nazis\nAnd we replaced our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that\nUh some feminists do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism it feminist for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices and stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nHad to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad and my right\nThere are things that that is exactly right so especially with the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine off of course do I mean as you you know you're the one to one day a\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can\nBecause politics of grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate called this stuff grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get anything touchy with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of\n... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation it's on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know we're left wing people who want the left\nTo come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you are an American I'm an American you're a person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think\nIncome and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details and I really hope that you know that our projects kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\n... past the catch a penny dinner conversation can be tests like getting catch it out of a bottle so or ... or what happened at school today but having making dinner

here we are twenty Eighteen in mid term election and what are the numbers look like\nSue ah depending on what you're looking at a you can find a lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican or ... or rooting for conservatives to to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously you need both to really have a good chance of passing anything and that's what we've seen over the past\nCouple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done um but\nUh what you're seeing now is really good polling or for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved to geo peas direction um to get to fifty is which is what they need of course to have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote\nYou need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty cents an additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to sweep those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean that is that yeah you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything you know the house is going to have both the other way and the houses where it looks real things look very bad for Republicans\nUm it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gains seats\nRight that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control angle as well who will control the house\nWell even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will gain any seats large because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the ... the chance of Republicans maintaining their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nAnd you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with they didn't get Trump right which is a big thing every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get truck right well first of all the national polls were almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump or it just didn't get the uh electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling and right and some of the states were were obviously wrong\nBut for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump or what they're saying there was a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of house seats in the house in fact they are saying the\nEqual chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they have a a\nA law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt\nStuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and the mayor released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we don't want to make it any worse\nTrying to make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for\nAs if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just thugs they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no way to win\nIt's a great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes that is that this is the job of being a mayor right you have your job of being a leader yeah it's supposed to actually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way\nI think you're right would you would not speak is just being right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes she has these opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side then you have a fully\nNatasha more on the ... and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI\nThe FBI building in Portland is is under siege for ... I mean singing the balls and these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building they call for police police say a we've got a call the mayor\nWhy\nI'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that ... the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger\nOr and that was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life\nThat I think they've had to move out of the city her and her family um they took her stuff destroyed it or threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean there are just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk it'd be paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when\nBut\nRead enough history usually people\nAre who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they were in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough and then they\nDo what they want with those people and they you know\nUse those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane meanwhile alec Alec Baldwin who uh has a

is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already\nI Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael boo play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so in ... yeah\nHe loves it I mean you can tell when you see 'em live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nCompletely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo

joking about he's because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink orders a pizza place and video games and jam\nThey came over we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow\nThis is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality his spokespeople are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a chore or in a book or ... album released and all that other stuff\nSo here's what he's here's what he says exactly to the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude to deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us and showed us compassion that\nGave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup there's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops\nQuote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means it\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled\nRight like he's had a whole press tour for this album it's just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nOr and and he seems to have I mean he he he's making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that\nUm because he just wants to spend time with his son how many times do we hear those excuses um according to our time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know ... to see\nThe real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know ... to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I've ever met in\nThe entertainment industry\nBecause he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate\nMe she didn't\nMean to popular hate you I Know but he but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand and he's like look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian why do I care and then you get out of it and then you get a fight at a hockey buddy yeah he said the guy turned around and said I could believe you'll look what Beck and he's like I'm Canadian I Do vote what what does it matter what they are to you and\nThe guy threw a punch and he said I threw punches back and he said I gotta do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight and [laughter]\nI Am so happy to

for virtually free or you know when when they sellers silver package to house today they claim they're going to save them over fifty percent of their electrical cost\nDepending on what your local zoning as you might even be able to sell some of that electricity back on to the grid\nAh yeah that particular role is getting fuzzy it's up to the [noise] independent companies that are your by purchasing\nYour your power from ah I eat here and bullets and see and they had to buyback program for a while and I'm not sure if it's still operational or not\nUh and that holds true for the rest of the suppliers in the state\nBut if everybody had it and they had access to sell back to the grid ah there I'm telling ya yeah we've covered this thing up real quick\nI Would also like to hear of that would require any restructuring of the electrical the infrastructure that we have right now because that much power coming back into it from the other direction might need to be adjusted for an eye AQAP\nI really kind of doubt it you're all you're doing is using the load on this system mhm so\nYou're all you're doing is using the load on the system mhm so I I don't don't perceive that being a problem\nBut I'm not an electrical engineer so I Can't get on a stack and buy more questions than answers at this point but I feel in the long run are my customers and myself would be financially better off if they came up with a plan for everybody to have it on their house\nOr even ... they they don't have to subsidize it a hundred percent uh that would be nice or it could be like the Obama phone uh everybody get solar panels or I don't know which way the government terms they seem to turn whichever direction they feel like but uh\nThe happens when you switch a political views drastically every so many years\n[noise] but I I I Do believe that the intention is good and just the process is wrong in my mind and I'll let it go at that time and if anybody out there has something to say about it go ahead and give us the shot I'll be happy to listen\nI'll have to get it back in here I Want to heal these days [laughter] All right uh so we got breaks on the mind that a break squeak oh yeah I've I've heard him do that on occasion especially after a nice uh rainfall like we got the other day\nThat can happen as as rushed to accumulates on that nice rom metal [laughter] they'll squeak until they clean it off a week between anyway ah what the email read was I I hear a high pitched squeak or squeal sound Everytime I apply mavericks\nWhy are my brakes on my car and producing that annoying sound and what do I need to do to fix them\nThat sounds like if I can make a salad guess here we spoke about this once before where there is a spot of the brake pads were after so much of the materials and sacrifice there's a squeaker\nYes that could be one of the reasons for this quake sent a fax the case you're down to less than twenty percent of bad life left meaning it's time to get the brakes done\nBut I'm assuming there are other symptoms around other causes for the symptom well out here in Arizona and especially in Bullhead city an accumulation of sand regret\nUh will can cause a some squeaking on your brakes uh they should go away after ... time a as we as you said earlier a rank and can cause a problem if you're driving through a puddle is after a rainstorm\nAnd you get your road is good and wet and\nThen you park the car and sit there for a day or so they're rotors could rushed up a little and then when you go to take off your memory I have a funny sound until you're aware of that restaurant which shouldn't take too many stops ... well ... yeah\nBut the average a mileage of a car out here in very far are you jumped in it and you go ah three three blocks to the grocery store and back that's not a long ways well it is if you hit all the lights [laughter] yeah free for all green lights [laughter] not if you want the rest are free for all reds\nBut anyway I ... as they do build in a a\nNoise maker so that that will tell you when you're just about out if that wasn't there or\nThe the ... are resulting case would be detrimental to your rovers or you wouldn't hear anything until the pad friction surface was completely gone and then you were metal metal\nAnd that wouldn't be so much of a squeaking as it would be a grinding\nYes and that would be a heavy grind and it wouldn't take about two stops to completely ruined a rover\nSo that would be adding to the cost\nAlthough nowadays wrote a replacement on her break job is not uncommon due to the fact that they may come from the factory in a manner or shy call old too thin [laughter] [noise] yeah and if you look at him over a progression over the last Twenty years [noise]\nRotors used to be very big and heavy there in fact they were um when I called two sided with none of words there was\nTwo sides to it what Vance in the middle that would help cooler odor down and dissipate the heat or there's not too many of those vented rotors left except on heavy duty applications\nIn some trucks and they're just a a thin piece of metal now with no particular place for the heat to dissipate other than off the face of them\nIn that atmosphere and if they get hot\nThere are so thin that they don't have enough structural integrity to stay straight than they wore and then you end up with a bouncy brake pedal\nWhy they uh tell you when you're going down those maybe somewhat steep inclines for an extended period of distance try not to ride your brain\nBe somewhat Steve inclines for an extended period of distance try not to ride your break but a switch to a lower gear\nYeah well use the engine as much as you can and also if you do have to\nWrite on the brake you're better off applying a little bit heavier break and and let's just say or target speed is sixty five miles an hour going down the hill and you've got yourself going Seventy or Seventy five will don't slow down to sixty five and then let it roll back up to Seventy five\nSlow down to sixty or fifty five\nThen give the brakes arrest till it builds up to speed again in slow down again\nThat will keep them from getting red hot by continual use huh\nWell when you're off of them they tend to cool down and you're not getting that access you were or any new work to rotors as good\nAs they'll save you from one of those situations where you are going to shoplift I hear a grinding or somewhere and then they post pictures of your broken rotors on the Internet\n... actually I had and somebody come in with one of the two sided or others that had the event fans in between\nBoth sides of the road or and on the ... side there was no roads are left dollar was was\nFins fins that had one very shiny side to them I'm assuming\nThat a lot yeah there were so it was a mess it was so outrageous that I actually say to order and I hung up on the wall to show people what\nHappens when you don't pay attention and listen you never want to be an example when you go into the shop [laughter] that's a it was a bad sign that was a\nLong time ago and we all have very many two sided brothers anymore so uh we'll go from there [laughter] in fact to what I say when you're driving your\nCar that the best the computer does a lot for you but the best person the best thing in the cars you\nWhat's on your shoulders and what's between yours yours sound of side smell and vibration all tip you off there's something wrong with the car sooner than anything else\nYou're used to driving that car and it feels a certain way and the first day you get in and and don't feel the way it's supposed to feel a very close attention\nTo not do senses site sounds now you see smoke anywhere you smell I smoke gasoline or I I smell something funny or it's more loyal burning or what is it you're smelling at that point get it checked out you know\nMake sure you have the GPS center the urgent care so you can get her take care of your panic attack and then get the car to the shop and have it checked out and\nGet the cart urgent care that auto doc then there'll be happy to fix it\nAll right so and ah you know if you've got the brakes making not quite a funny noise maybe not ha ha funny about oh they're funny\nDo you call in and let us know here at a king then nine to eight seven five three twelve thirty and Bullhead city Laughlin Fort Mojave Mojave valley and needles nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety and the toll free at one aid for four to one nine twelve fifty what are we going to talk about when we come back from the break coming up in a minute here\nNow we'll go to a sticky breaks sticky next stinky sticky sticky yeah\nAll right that the sound like the time I go hunting at the store for my tea and ... and ... and ... kept kept him off and it was all over the seat that gripped right in the next to my car my brakes were sticky all the way down there you go All right\nWhatever the issue is they should be able to address it in ... and if they don't uh then you you'd probably want to mark that place off of your shopping list and and and find another one\nYeah always got to be evaluating whether or not you want to stick with something or move on\nAnd just go on to the doctor either you like what they tell you you know and I mean they take care of you you said there is a they give you some bad medicine and some bad advice need probably going to be finding a new one\nWow I like the doctor I went there twice now and I'm Still alive [laughter] they're doing a great job\nYeah but I don't feel so good anymore [laughter] [noise]\nAll right so that's the first two items on breaks went also regard\nWell then and in part of the braking system as a BS the ah we hang out of an anti lock brakes social system anti lock braking system okay Allen there yeah there should be but anti lock is one word oh I'm sure there's a high [laughter]\nAnyway\nDo you understand what anti lock brakes do for you sir\nAh the daily like now where if you're on the road and you're a maybe not on the most steady of surfaces or even if you are 'cause you don't want to fly too much it gives your brakes if you're the sort of person that panic some jams the pedal way way down\nA little bit of leeway in how quickly the brakes interact with the ...\nThe way and how quickly the breaks a interact with Reuters and if it doesn't quite stop your wheels dead\nYou're kind of right ... actual way that that title outbreaks function is when you apply severe break pressure or in a panic stock situation or for whatever reason something's in front of you that shouldn't be there and you need to get stopped quick\nIf you and the old cars if you just slammed on the brakes the tires would\nBreak traction with the surface of the road or whatever services you're on and then you would start to slide now at that point as yours as a rubber sliding against the pavement you're not getting maximum\nEfficiency 'cause the brakes already did a job is to stop the oil from turning yeah\nBack in the heart of the cars they'll get out on mental yeah why not anti lock brakes does is it modulate the pressure at to break it has a reserve a reservoir\nOf pressurized fluid in it and what does it does is it ... states it on and off on and off in in milliseconds this happens rhetoric quickly the computer controlled and with the wheel speed censor\n\nIt knows if the wheels coming to a complete stop it releases a break just enough to allow the will to turn and they've done extensive testing on this and the car with a BS breaking functioning properly will stop\nQuite a bit quicker and shorter distance than any manual break or\nIs it are effectively extends the surface area for breaking on the moving tire with the road right instead of just having that you know one hand size spot of tire on the road it's going to continue slowing the car down this entire rotates\nWell in ... there was a whereas a portion of his classic called called fishing sub\nDrag mhm and that's what you're actually getting in to hear them so that that is how abs works anyway how do an ad hoc braking systems work was the question\nAnd I've covered pretty much what I Know but we'll give you what to\nAnswer is very well be entering Web told us about it at all so anti black braking systems use sensors that each wheel or and the differential to monitor we'll speed these sensors can detect whether the wheels are about to lock up\nAll the abs components ... valve computer control and sensors working injunction with two men are allies will lock up\nI skidding by controlling break pressured each individual will by not locking up the wheels you maintain better control of your vehicle and under a heartbreaking conditions and when the roads are slippery\nYou only bad thing about um is it makes it much harder to do donuts [laughter]\nHey yeah [laughter] well that and all wheel drive or a one eighty turn sixty miles an hour yep which again you want a real a low center of gravity on the car for that which a lot of modern vehicles they don't have as much as an independent\nBreaking you only want to use the rumors [laughter] that as well yes All right so uh we're\nDone with breaks we're going to move on to a few pumped issues ooh that somebody at Wright and ask I gave my truck and ignition tune up but the trucks still pops through the intake manifold while accelerating\nWhat could be the problem\nAh if I had a dart board I Try and landed on vacuum hoses just 'cause I don't know what I'm Talking about but that's why I Try and throw it ... if you had an old car you might be close to any answer\nThere although vacuum links to cause issues even with all of these computers to cars yeah so that's something not to overlook\nI'm\nPart of the electronic computer space age diagnostics that we use it auto doc start with basics are three things you need for an internal combustion engine to work\nCompression fuel and spark\nAnd another\nComponent in the mechanical aspect of the and then his vacuum if you have a vacuum owes its off than you are affecting the vacuum system which could an intern affect the way the vehicle runs even on the computer control cars\nThe issue or the problem\nWith the computer controlled car is the computer has the capacity to make up for some of those small things and you wouldn't notice it as much to an extent ...\nIf I'm going to solve every problem for you know but they help a lot\nSo there's there's a lot to be said\nOh ... but they help a lot\nSo there's there's a lot to be said for computer cars until the ... and then we'll see [laughter]\nSo as far as a fuel what'd you say fuel pumps or fuel and directors Wakefield pop\nA sounds like he may have Joe pressure problem if you have not changed if you'll filtered try that first\nWe've got into this before feel filters if they're accessible on the car we have to carry out that now today there's a lot of vehicles that have the filter incorporated in the pump in the tank\nThat sounds like an expensive replacement\nWell they're designed to only be replaced if and when that you'll needs to be replaced no it's actually part of the phone system\nBut if you got real dirty fuel what them well then you're going to be putting new pumpkin [laughter]\n... we're we're going to come back on a

didn't like your opportunity you like to tweet as you can do a sep show say good morning do direct TV the audience network which channel two thirty nine on direct TV the ... or NBC Sports network as well in our great\nRadio affiliates around the country the storyline was writing itself Tom Brady the NFL's elder statesmen passing the torch to Patrick ... homes in doing it in primetime that was the underlying theme last night and the problem is\nTom Brady doesn't want to pass that George anytime soon the New England quarterback is normal study itself into three point when but from\nA homes he showed off his brilliance once again he struggled early then got hot and the second it happened almost pulled off the comeback mobile homes has come down a little bit off that haunts start but that's to be understandable because Thirteen touchdowns no picks in your first three games\nHe's a special player but nobody has done that before and maybe this was a game we're going to look back on in the future and go kind of remember when Brady and more homes were on the field at the same time\nBut then I started to think the way these two teams are playing we might be saying that in this year's AFC title game a lot of fun last night and I think that both of these teams proving you don't have to have a great defense to be great\nI'm looking at the same says well I don't think they have a great defense yet they might have one they might rediscover one like they did last year\nOr the rams great often it's a good defense potentially a pretty good defense but you're looking at these teams now that are trying to score you and the chiefs are one of those teams machines aren't going to be in too many games they're not going to win too many games where it's Twenty one Seventy it's just not\nBut if you're going to let them score\nAnd that's what happened last night and they're not out of it when you have ... and you have mom's the beauty of this Kansas City often is that Andy Reid went all in on homes understanding he had a big time arm\nAnd this is put pressure on the defensive unlike Alex Smith when he was there Alex Smith economical gay manager Patrick home says no Patrick more homes couldn't win games for you and last night in nearly wanted for them\nIt was a lot of fun though to go back and forth but you know I thought that New England up twenty four nine and I don't think that there's really going to be a safe lead against Kansas City this year but this is in New England it's twenty four nine and I thought okay you know maybe they've kind of figured this out\nAnd then that's when homes goes oh that's right I get the fastest guy in the NFL in ...\nThere's a difference in speed\nAnd I didn't realize this is much until I saw it in person and I brought this up before when I saw you say bull want a run in the London games\nTo see him in person is completely different than watching on TV there are certain guys when you watch them on the field in person you go oh that's different tie retail is different than anybody else in the NFL\nThere are a lot of quick guys there are a lot of ... there's only a couple that are quick and really fast and tirade kills book he's quick to get to his top in speed\nThere are other guys who were just quick\nAnd watching tiger retail last night and there's no answer for\nBecause if you get to the point where you're sort of with him you're behind him and that's what happened with the patriots here is Bill Bill or check on assessing both sides of the bar\nFor us on the field so not too good teams and they simply vote computer very arcane down to play the game there's a lot of football players out there in Kosovo\nHere's Tom Brady on that Kansas City often\nTo I was happy we made the third one that there was a great opportunity then we had some other place James made some Craig catching runs in the big fight Iraq he gotta match up and made a big ... who's been making a lot of those is career I'll ...
