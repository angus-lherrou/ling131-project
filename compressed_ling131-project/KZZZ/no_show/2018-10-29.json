this and not have been there wasn't an uprising as a result there's some some people are unhappy some people are not unhappy\nBut I think this happened before where the and I said it's been one of my angles last week on Fox that the goal here is to turn Trump into a conventional politician\nI don't think that's going to happen\nTrucks and not a conventional politician he's going to do things the way he thinks are going to resonate that's what the people are going to advance his agenda consumer spending by the way way up consumer confidence way out\nA three point five percent GDP last month

course he wants to win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum and uh\nUh well no I mean excuse me the governorship obviously against Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor or the current governor outgoing governor\nA and Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you can uh be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson the both

trajectory and I'm a candidate who is going to build up the success that Florida's had in terms of our economy\nAndrew Gillum wants to forty percent tax increase but I think voters know that will destroy our economic momentum I'm also a candidate that has a really solid plan to fix some of the environmental and water quality problems they look at Andrew Gillum at somebody that wants to impeach Donald Trump\nHow are you going to be able to get these problem solve with require consultation with the federal government or if you're out there saying the guy should be impeached so I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done\nAnd then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in Tallahassee history and I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because\nAt the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defender\nSupport their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about the\nAllure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\nSo\nI'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me and he does for for Andrew because I think folks will ah who may not otherwise one vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the ... regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses to come down and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first uh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida\nAnd then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas\nUm you know that put the race away for cat that I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is um silver Tunde order\nI mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric ties today he tries to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother used to say I have a dog will holler\nMid sentence has spoken a first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in the state [noise] uh he has spoken at racist conferences not calling miss the defense of races I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the our ... our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today um there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I planted my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also advocate textbook socialist principles\nThe virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli\nGroups supporting Gillum honey response\nOr yeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew was the one who was aligned themselves with the dream defenders\nThey are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott divest and sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they take special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement\nFrom a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement as racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice um and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he said I'm\nIn terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course that's the FBI are aging as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption and turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks\nFor one and killing fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nThat's right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff well then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message just showing he acknowledge\nDays later there was a text message just showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton\nWas actually paid for by and undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer and then it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote it almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nDisclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigator isn't being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and its palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating don't that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith a laser politics but I go down to some really simple in these last closing dance sleazy dishes sleazy politics as usual bribes uh people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter of fact Campbell ticket or a\nTrip or restaurant it's sleazy corrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership it's not\nIt is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nI heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you've got your\nDiagram that sense um but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better thirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states\nUh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants in a caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want him to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the uh ...\nThis is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance or the nearest refuge they've they've rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override all our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum\nA supports the caravan coming into the United states as running mate was out there saying yesterday that we need to welcome in the caravan into the United states um and so you couldn't have a more stark difference um for borders Andrews for open borders I Want to support our men and women and if he wants to abolish ice\nWell again this is a this is an issue that I think the American people are following very closely I'm Andrew Gillum actually speaking now in Miami and I'm sure we'll a pulse them down there a Kamala Harris stumping with him right now so they they see this race a congressman\nThe cost of a flu shot is often covered by your health plan jak

I. A. S. likes to bring invaders\nIn that kill our ... doesn't make sense and that oh that kill our people then said screw your optics I'm going in well first of all that's an anti Semitic take on\nAn issue that is it it's a common sense issue someone's truly are of a religious refugee that's completely different than people just saying it's crush the nails and said I'm coming because I Want a better way

next\nBut we still have a week to go he joins us now uh it's good to have you on Mr Morsi how're you\nDoing great Laura thanks for having me on your program today\nAbsolutely a let's talk about the effort to blame the president his rhetoric his language for this horrific attack on the synagogue\n[noise] well I I think this is just another example of what we've been seeing all fall you have a resistance obstruction impeachment caucus that's basically on Capitol Hill in the house and in the Senate and you have Hillary Clinton\nWho says she's capable of civility you have all these radicals\nThat they're only goal is to bring this president doubt as they're going to take the most outrageous positions whatever Trump says\nThey're going to take the opposite position and that's not right and you have to have respect for this president\nWho has done so much to restore America the credibility abort if you look at Israel this is a president that it's been a staunch ally of Israel and actually had the guts\nTo go and follow through to make Jerusalem the capital in terms of locating the embassy this was huge but they will fight any way to pick at President Trump fortunately in West Virginia\nPresident Trump has a lot of support he won the election by forty two points\nWhen I get elected I'm going to be a concern for the fighter for President Trump's agenda and separately the reason why people were fleeing from Joe mansion is he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be a first vote in the Senate and West Virginia which are\nChuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama eight years and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in a state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why the action is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some price of Hillary and Obama but ... is not pro life\nA mansion supports Planned Parenthood\nMatching supports radical done control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all is that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe mansion and the more people learn about his actual record\nNot his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more people learn about dishonest Washington liberal ... and they move away from them so it's an education process\nWhat about the um issues of\nJust basic fairness that we saw her eyes after the Kavanaugh I'm hearing Joe mansion or voted for cabin on the end but a man that I think most people just saw that as just an\nExample of rank unfairness and treating some time treating someone who is accused as you know they were guilty just because they were accused\n[noise] well I think that's right and I for folks following at home when you know that Joe mansion literally waited on his name was first called on the Senate floor\nMatching powder and in fact he only came back to the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nCabinet off we know that\nFeinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee Joe mansion aided enough that it Feinstein and Schumer by waiting giving the maneuvering room I think that's the word they use\nThat's what the problem is I've got like ... you know he may appear to be more moderate rhetoric but in reality when you're first vote is to empower these\nRadicals then you can't be considered moderate he is a dishonest washing the liberal and more and more voters are learning that\nLet's talk about the economy in West Virginia the president decided early on that he was going to try to do when he could to reinvigorate the coal miners their way of life\nAnd yet he's ridiculed even today I Can't remember I saw ... today for his comments about clean coal Patrick\n[noise] yeah I think many people realize that the president has really follow through on his promises to the people West Virginia let's start with coal as many people listening no I let that twenty seven state coalition to defeat Obama's poll killing rights\nAt the U.S Supreme Court but that that is served as a bridge to\nPresident Trump and then he fell through on his promises which were on some of those crazy and ... and that's putting some miners back for no look we have a long way to do but they're starting to see a lot more activity in the energy area and that's directly related to the optimism people have with the Trump\nPresidency but it goes beyond that\nThe Trump tax cuts are very beneficial for West Virginia not only a doubling of the standard deduction and the lowering of the rates but in West Virginia we have fifty five of these opportunities owes which\nAre going to allow impoverished communities to lift up and reach their potential that's huge and that's\nCredit to President Trump Joe mansion said no to the Trump tax cuts and he kind of goes back and forth and say well he was open than he wasn't the reality is he voted no he voted the wrong way because Chuck Schumer wouldn't let them vote for it and that's not the kind of leadership we need but we are seeing a resurgence in West Virginia\nAnd you have to give this president credit for so many good things he's done on taxes on regulatory relief on picking rule of law judges that instills confidence in the system which allows\nA entrepreneur is to spend more of their capital\nOr we are going to be covering this race very closely over the next seven days election day next week but you can vote early in West Virginia correct\nYes in fact ah October twenty fourth or early voting began sort of average people to go out to the polls if you need to learn about your early voting location go to Patrick Morrisey\nIf you need to learn about the early voting locations and go to Patrick or she dot com or vote dot GOP and they'll take it to the right place\nOh fantastic uh Patrick

Bible believing people won't Bible believing people also took up the other way of course that always will happen look at how many people have taken twisted the constitution to say things that it doesn't say\nOf course those that's people\nWhat's the essence of what God is telling us what is the essence of swear to you every almost except for the taxes almost everything after the tenth amendment is just a repeat\nWe think we're coming up\nWith new thanks yeah well we need an amendment now to say that blacks can wrote Mm slavery shouldn't happen really do we not if you understood the first ten all\nCovered their numbers than just doesn't say okay for you people who are stupid that means black people to women\nCan vote it's time we say women can vote\nWell women voted in the colonial era [noise] not yes they did they did not yes they did\nWhat we needed amendment it chose women go\nOkay well you are too stupid you didn't understand the first ten which is to see the thing they didn't mean all men are creative team into people are created equal is to have ... you still cute\n[laughter] well I mean they they weren't voting at that time which is why they put the amendment in there right\nYou know sort of ... going on which is why they do but your point is because of I needed to clarify what the actual origin those are only clarification yeah those are only Clara it's like a balloon when we said all men were created equal we blew it by you know not including black men in that so\nNo more slavery right like right that is uh\nWe didn't blow it you didn't understand it they understood at the founders were very clear\nVery clear what is it by about Thomas Jefferson when they have the constitution and it doesn't stop slavery it only stops the slave trade what part of because I Know\nGod that is just I tremble for my country what part of that\nAs there was agreement to that which is why they didn't ban and then the original document right I mean it you know I yes right like that's the issue I think like that\nIn a race that disagreement I think what you're saying is that that would cause that was absolutely Jefferson's intent to get rid of slavery absolutely it's unquestionable I mean you read his writing on the topic it's\nUnquestionable he'd done it for a draft of the declaration of independence and his handwriting changes\nOh yeah I mean he may get angry angry yeah uh and so it's unquestionable but you know and he had to remove that to get things done or because of requests by a couple of southern states it right and you know what\nHay progressive if you believe if you believe\nThat a global warming is going to be the death of all of us if you really believe that it is what you say it is and we only have a few more years then why don't you start a war\nAnd kill all of the people that disagree with you because that's exactly what our founders ... we're\nUp against you don't believe in slavery good start a second war and now slaughter the people in your own country that you don't agree with\nThat is what it was and so they decided no I'm going to take progressive steps were going to get rid of it here will get rid of it here and we'll keep working on it because people will finally see the light of day we don't want another war progressive don't you dare don't you dare condemn them\nWhen you won't kill the person who

they'll send it out to you thank you so much for holding him thanks for um\nThey do feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to them I'm a little frustrated that are at the new nation I Would say yeah to enable I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things and I think that's kind of what she's saying here um let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nOr being an anti Semite she's his daughter is Jewish\nThe ... you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any\nRelatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like a you know what\nYeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this guy and she's got to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen\nAnd when you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations was to move the capital package roost alum and then the guy that did it I mean he you know look it's insane\nIt boils down to these ridiculous uh summaries\nOf what a person believes they are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left\nThat you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite and the same way like a liberal should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas they should be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist\nBut this this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by\nYou know Mother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question at the question what part of it gave me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me do what the Allison just said let's make a tangible\nHere is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWell it's just shocking moment I mean I'd I'd we view it all through our own experience I I have had a life as a Jewish American which has been is not only free of anti Semitism\nBut I've had this opportunity to be elected senator from a state Connecticut where the Jewish population as well to present and then I'll gorges me the chance to run for vice president first Jewish American on a national took that\nUh that really didn't know I face no anti Semitism\nA and forgive me for going back to the end of the two thousand election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes and the other ticket ... what's your as a reflection in numbers that people were voting are based on religion so when something like this happens\nIt's shocking and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is that the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it in the wholesome reaction of the neighbors who are not Jewish and scroll hill Pittsburgh and then the elected officials there it was very genuine\n... and of course that was not please CNN this is not what they want it out of chili and they didn't bring him on to say that he had a good experience as an American you know to bring him on to say positive things\nThey brought amounted to clarify exactly what portion of this is Donald Trump's fault tell us so we don't have to say it say he's responsible so we can have plausible deniability that that that this is exactly what we believe we don't want to come out and say at five thousand times we'll just have to what you say it OK\nIs especially the way they lead into the next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear listen\n... that there are those who for seen those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see on that one of the closing ad campaign George Soros a Shannon yelling more Blankfein from Goldman Sachs with dark ominous picture and then talking about the money and the international banker question okay is that something that that sends a message\nAll the first thing I Want to say is that in my opinion this brutal murderer in tips for really had to wear was committed by a hateful loner who was probably\nMore stimulated by a or anti Semitism in a social media than anything else going around him he ... he was against\nA President Trump is real a real I I was going to see the the website it's taking it down for a while and and all the social media people have to ask whether there have been coming vehicles for this kind of hatred but more generally I think all of us\nA half to ... beginning with the president democratic and Republican leaders in Congress people in the media conventional media and the more of an unconventional social media have to ask ourselves\nTo what extent are weak contributing to the division in our society Charlie Dent that I worked together and a group of No Labels trying to overcome or the way the parties have become like worrying tribes but this goes beyond just learned ride\nWhy worrying tribes but this goes beyond ya Gore's ride and that is the one that is well what would I say we're on the president makes a a ... statement about you in are the\nUh let's presume for now than urged them to build on it and think about ways in which a hippie an act so that no one can ever say a ... he somehow was responsible for violence or or hatred\nAgain if the the the Joe Lieberman forty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not pro Trump\nNot I mean he was ... viscerally\nAnti Trump in a way of he you know what I don't like about Donald Trump is he's too nice to Jews that is essentially what the guy was saying\nOn social network over and over and over and over again so he was not a pro Trump guy that shot up this sucks the synagogue\nA and you know like if it's important to make that distinction and how do you bring people together the exact opposite of what CNN trying to do in that clip he caught I mean without saying what does it in the night this Joe Lieberman possible way right but what are you saying is what you're doing right now\nBy trying to make this into a situation where Trump is blamed what we should do is wrong what we should do instead is when he said something that we think helps the environment we should praise it sure certainly you generally speaking we have an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that um but when it comes to the shooting it's not related\nRight so here's what the media should have done this weekend the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric on social media and from the president to and from the press and everything else what role does media play in in in the life\nOf a guy who as we saw this non white male um ... tried to commit with a you know with a pipe bombs\nThe guy was nuts the guy was absolutely nuts he was a loner she had finally found the cause that he could you know rallied behind she ... you know was\nNot he was nuts okay so that one what role does politics play does the media play do politicians play in whining people up\nThat's a viable ask a question on that particular topic and not just about Trump but the whole thing\n... ... what role does the media play what about Twitter what about Facebook what's winding some of these people up what happens in the future\nOkay valid\nThe shooting in Pittsburgh here's how they should have covered this this guy was a anti Semite who this clearly had nothing to do with politics the guy he hated Donald Trump this is\nJust a loner just like the guy in the van and he had no friends\nHe had no friends she was a sick twisted guy\nWhat is the whole in America why are we seeing this now\nBecause it\nIt's not Donald Trump and it's not for Rocco bomber ... right there's something fundamentally missing here what is it why are we changing why are kids killing themselves at a record rate\nThere is a bigger issue here than politics but nobody in the media wants to address it because nobody in the media and nobody in politics can win\n[noise]\nBy the way we're doing an episode tonight on what happened in Brazil and the

N. K. triple the I'm your host Dana how and it is a sort of a Monday kind of a day which means that the auto doc is here in the studio with us yet on and on gay AAA cater belief show\nDuck you're going to talk to buy cars today\nOh yeah we got something to talk about here we've got a a it's a normal problems that are going to happen this time of year we'd be happy to get into it with them a brother pertaining to overheating problems that are happening to the humans and the vehicles\nAnd if you've got a problem that is that or even one that isn't that hopefully that's a wide enough an ethic catch some callers in there you go or what do they have to do\nThey need to call us and a nine to aid area from Kingman seven five three twelve thirty in the Bullhead and surrounding area and nine to eight seven six three fourteen Ninety and toll free anywhere that you can you hear this one aid for four to one nine twelve fifty\nThat's just as easy as it is so you were talking about over sheeting is that the sort of a deal with and then just gets too hot I'm going to work out you know work it out from what it sounds like\nYeah and when it runs above words as opposed to it can cause a lot of problems\nThe engines get hot by nature what is too hot\nWell there's a normal operating temperature for engines today that uh with the thermostat say having what heavier\nThan operating range between one Ninety and to Ken in on a hot summer day out here they might even run it two twenty a dependent on the radiator condition but anything over that is going to ah [noise] could could lead to severe engine damage you and they have to be careful\nAll right I think we might actually have a color that's even get them on okay scholar you are on the air with alive and local in the afternoon how are you\nFooling really knock me this is you know this is a river river do are you a great what's up I Would call me what can they got two questions go ahead I can\nBuy two dollar and Fifteen cent oil at a big box store or I can buy six dollar oil at a big box store why should I buy both on the eyes stacks the latest\nWhy should I buy the more expensive oil my second question is about gas okay\nThere's a one company that has is a quote unquote special a chemical and our gas uh-huh and uh it's usually quite a bit more expensive\nIs there any reason to lie it or just a regular all a death\nOkay well let's start with the oil or your cheaper oil you're talking about is just a straight straight oil\nOr that if you change your oil every three thousand miles a year more than a perfectly good with as long as it's uh\nAnd like in the Fords and some other cars it's a gold color and then most of all your GM's it's an orange color\nAnd then in the import cars we have red and blue\nSo the color of cooling today is a kind of a devious question\nAnother one of those monopoly money situations All right we have another caller here let me see uh hello hello you're on the air was alive and local in the afternoon who am I speaking to\nRight it's just a richer okay Lynn Ajdabiya\nHey out our dog hey I got a question about my four hundred thousand won't Ford Ranger it's a three point out later I I called you about this for three weeks to get 'em at last\nIn her eyes I called you about this for three weeks to get 'em and won't start at all I can push started the engine run ... fine\nAnd replace the I forget the ... the it's a five day then you gotta pushing the clutch hundreds of switch down there um unless it costs just pushed and they all start divert place that\nI pulled my starter out tickets to other parts store and it got checked it out said last starter was good uh he also told me I should check there was a starter so annoyed by fender but I look on my two thousand or ranger I didn't think that there will always what else could it be\nWell I think you're going to have to get a wiring diagram I'm pretty sure there is most forms average charters Illinois\nYou ... when you turn the key to try and started with the collection pushed into you hear any clicking at all\nThere is a clicking noises are ... there is a huge box up on the left a lot too far from the battery\nMight in fact a little closer you may find your so annoyed in that area without referring to the manual or my my service uh stuff I Can't tell you exactly where it is but I'm fairly certain\nThat unless there is so annoyed on the sport starter which most sports stars don't have is Illinois on them\nYou're going to have to have one inside the engine compartments somewhere and if you've already done a neutral safety switch the only two things left that would cause a problem would be there'd be the ignition switch itself or the ... starters Illinois\nOkay narrows it down for me I'm getting closer [laughter]\nDo you keep looking and you'll get their W\nAlright I'll Try it our aggregate to attack here\nThank you for listening All right Beth I like All right stars so annoyed I'm and I'm just thinking of all the different uh ... I I was an engineering once upon a time and then I have a\nWell there's a show in Niger used a ... cars for a lot of things are they work\nAnd in conjunction with um the engine parts just like a a\nA relate does for electronics mhm uh except it's an older mechanical type for Elaine I prefer the crank ... a level to compression the cars nowadays your arm wouldn't appreciate to crank\n[laughter] added to break away no problem yeah All right we're we're with the with the hot stuff\nOh well I ... you could have if you do have an overeating problem there are some\nThings to look for a and to pay attention to most all the time while you're driving your car and checking out check for cooler leaks\nYour vehicle cooling systems objective is to maintain and optimal offering temperature for the engine the cheeses by circulating cool in through the engine or it absorbs heat when the ... delivered to the radiator worthy heat is removed from the coolant\nWhen the system has a leak and the coolant level drops to low it will be unable to remove the heat from the engine and it will start to overheat\nSide note here you might also want to understand the most coup attempt sensors are higher up in the motor\nThat works or not at the bottom of the engine cooling system there are closer to the top so as soon as that cool that level starts dropping than the sensor is not in coolant anymore in at that point it will not give it an accurate reading\nYou could have had your pool a temperature gauge shoe to all the way up to the red\nAnd then you notice that it started falling back down but the cars still seems to be very hot\nThat is probably because you've lost enough cooling centers and covered in water anymore and you're not getting an accurate reading now to this answer\nOccasionally it's just getting flushed and a given that reading going back down again and\nWell you're going to take an average on most cars today you have to sensors you have a a edging cool and damp censor\nAs part of the computer system which is an electronic signal to the computer telling the computer how warm the car is and then you have a second regular censor that operates the gauge so to kind of redundant systems in the car\nSo anyway that was just a side note on that airs solution\nOr some wasted identify an obvious coon link issue menial seeing message are warning light on the day she mails going to notice the small a smell of cooling\nIn and around the car can you describe that\nSmell what is it close to ... closely approximate Mm it's\nKind of a sweet smell suspiciously sweet\nNot like chocolate but it is a sweet smell\n... well not like chocolate but it is a sweet smell a\nFew ... when it goes to steam it has a a definite\nAroma if you've ever been around and you'll recognize it and I never forget it ... it's a it's different and they don't smell like burn oil and it don't smell like gasoline\nBut as a one of those distinctive automotive sense to it\nYeah out out yeah All right and it would be [noise]\nIf you ever have the opportunity to get near some some vehicle that was hot and per chance get to smell it you you generally smell as soon as you walk by it\nIt would pay to walk that in your memory because if you happen to\nBe driving your car down the road Sunday and inside the\nCar you notice the fate with the smell\nPeriodically that could indicate that you have a heater core\nLeak in the car well yeah and that's not good because there's a place for coolant\nLeaked it is very hard to detect and could cause you to\nBe low I'm cool went to get law school and went to eventually over eat or\nAnd if that's the situation you're in and you can't quite afford to get a repair just yet my that suggest going out to some of the yard sales that they have in the weekend to see if they can find a cast iron pan and maybe a pot holder if you're coming back one day when he got the groceries and\nYou're just not going to make it home and gives you cars broken down at least you can make some eggs on the engine\nOr it's going to go to a woman and participate in sidewalks right yeah one is that on July Fourth\nOkay and [laughter] I always say watch outright got he got in competition [noise]\nOkay we're back to the solution for this school and like there are some ways to identify an obvious coolant leaked gives you may see a message warning light on the gas and they also noticed a smell cool and in and around the car\nOr observing fluid dripping onto the ground and he sees you know on your garage or your driveway there's a spot on the ground take time to and investigate it\nSee whether it's oil power steering fluid transferred or cooling is just so help you identify where the problem is and when you go to the garage\nOr to shock to every car work God you can tell them all and by the way I found cooling in the on the underneath the car well as part of it that that would be a big help 'cause a lot of times we'll get people come in and say well there's a big spot under the car well was it oil\nAnd if it was what kind of an engine or transmission\nMaybe don't know it just ended up like an oil and they will hold on [noise] but then they don't know and and\nIf you actually just take cooler and pick it up on your finger and Robert together all feel kind or at least so that's not a good\nTest but if you pick it up and it feels kind of oily and you just stick it to the tip you your\nTongue\nAnti free was poisonous tree you don't want to get very much but if you just get a little bit on your finger in touch your tongue it'll be sweet just enough to spice up the line\nYeah you know spice it up for you [laughter] but you'll ah and also the coolant if you're aware of what color it is in your car most of the cars American Carson Daley there'd be a gold or orange or the green is in the older cars\nAll right I'm going to see if we can get this caller on the air just long enough to get their question color you are on the air with live and local in the afternoon who am I speaking to\nRobert came on I don't know how are you\nPretty good good afternoon tournament I wanted to make a quick point I'm with the ... bring up the safety feature safety concerns about playing with hot cold I think people are open a rating or caffeine is called half their face off and that's not something that everybody wants to experience\nYes sir that is for sure and I just a little farther into this when you go to check for here actually caught on the road and you pull over me open the hood and there's geysers going off everywhere and you want to\nTwelve fifty [noise] what was the most\nUh interesting thing you've seen in last month\nAs far as car repair that might have been unconventional um well it\nAll seems normal to me every day so I don't have anything that stood out in the last month anyway\nUh every other week up some of the clown a metropolis [laughter] rambling on the way [laughter] oh yeah that's well\nThat's what our job is to solve problems and then when people get to our ... they're having a problem unless we're doing a regular maintenance\nRegular regular care and our regular customers that's generally all they ever need is when we find things that are going to\nCould possibly go bad on them in the in the future in the near future and we advise them and they take care of her or at a time and they don't end up stuck on a road\nPlus you've been in this business so long probably nothing surprises you about much anymore\nOr not much\nAh I was I was telling him what am I\nUm I was I was telling him what am I going to last week about a something that happened to me in the past ... talking about engine clearances on a specially on the uh work for the oil cleaners is on the crank shift\nAnd how it I mean they're ... they're they're set up when you build a motor there is only about a towel and a half one and a half thousand that's not very much\nA clearance for the oil and why he the need for good oil because that's the barrier between the two metals is the barrier don't hold up in the medals come together\n[noise] All right I'm going to try and get this\nCall on the line color you are on the air with alive and local in the afternoon who am I speaking to\nHi you're speaking with Anthony I Am today [noise]\nAll right I'm I'm calling in for the gentleman I'm doing a how shall I say third party diagnosis\nOkay well we can always do the backdoor job go ahead Anthony\nOkay will soon serve mom you're giving a lot a lot of good information thank you but um I wanted to comment on the gentleman with the no crank Ford Ranger OK\nOne okay older vehicles people tend to put alarms\nOn them after market alarms and my thought is now we diagnose electrical problems and do things like that on our own\nAh for various people have all kinds of tools for that and uh and lots of experience somebody to have someone does even actually happen to us personally [noise] okay I'm alarm on a old vehicles can keep the vehicle from cranking horse starting\nSo what I'm saying is when the guy calls in with a no crank but he can push started a I Want him to check and see if he has a after market all alarm on there\nAnd if he has an after market alarm take it off really who the yellow blue wire and it all crank and start a you know you didn't have you had an alarm on it are alarmed by North Korea\nIn my estimation in my experience for causing no cranks and they'll start on a little bit older vehicles okay the wires get praying they get moved they get moved around a hundred the dash and they're they don't end up in good shape so that's just my estimation on that okay\nYes as a very valid point and it is a good question\nUm [noise] I I that that would be something that is a a W calls back in the last game but I Do not believe that he does have that\nOur biggest problem with uh the alarms that you're talking about are mostly after market alarms that they use great leaders installed in the vehicles before they sold them\nTo the uh unsuspecting customer and knows a\nCheap will allow us to cause a lot of trouble and if we we see one come into the shot the first thing we do is recommend complete remove all of that and putting the wires back the way they were originally\n[noise] Yes sir I'm I've I've seen in my lifetime ten vehicles little arms on them in ten vehicles that wouldn't start there you go ... salt and and we pulled the alarms out of all ten of them and all of them work\nUh he's putting a starter and he's putting an alternate or a battery wire a battery a neutral sweatshop a clutch Mitchell switch up you know on and on and on and on and it's still not gonna ever start because he didn't\nDiagnose it properly or that's trying to my point on that one I I have a four point if you'll bear with me sure OK\nI'm here we're talking about cars overheating what causes it and what you can do to prevent it and she wants to do if it does overheat correct\nYeah guy general of the guy guidelines you as\nA general guidelines will I have found that not so much on cars that are seven eight years old but cars that reach about ten years old when they get about ten years old\nYou need to put new catalytic converters on them all of them because the catalytic converters can and do you keep the car up beyond the ability to cool that's been this is\nMy father also down on orange bar at that point too\n[noise] [noise] Yes sir that is correct and most people don't notice it because it's like boiling a frog in water how do you boiled frog in water\nYou do it very gradually sold the power goes down very gradually until it gets to such a such a low point then you are finally notice it but I was saying that catalytic converters do not get placed\nA nearly as often as they need to be most cars are recommended around a hundred thousand to replace the catalytic converters and I don't think he's I Know anybody by myself it's ever replace the cat and I've said many old\nA nearly as often as they need to be most cars are recommended around a hundred thousand to replace the catalytic converters and I don't think I Know anybody but myself ever replace the cat and I've said many old cars by replacing chats before they before\nThey will read once they overheat with back tears\nYou got cracked heads a ball and head gasket and\nAll that stuff All right all I Want to thank you for all the uh ... advised Roberto if you're listening check for the alarm\nYeah you're right on the alarm little birds All right thank you sir\nHave a great day oh You're welcome

only question really who puts an after market alarm in a Ford Ranger\nWell paid by the use from a used car lot they could have just install it is a a that was a gimmick that they had a I think the gypsies were running around selling them to use ... and the gimmick there was\nYour car comes with an alarm you know it costs you a hundred dollars well they were getting them installed for twenty five dollars\nYeah and then or sell them to you for a hundred and he didn't have a choice was already in the car yeah\nAll right it was there was a guy is kind of a flaky deal and every time we see when we take it out [laughter] so [laughter] right though and he\nWas right he's had Danny's removed can in their cars were fine after that so right we'll be right back on live in local we all

Martinez in granted both Homer last night but those weren't the guys who led the Sox throughout the series they were spreading it around with heroes like Steve Pearce\nHe was the world series MVP Eduardo noon you as Andrew ban attendee Jackie Bradley junior then the pitching staff and then the most unlikely age\nDavid Price he won both of his charge an impressive fashion\nBeat a couple of Cy Young winners in the process in the playoffs the bullpen a potential liability was brilliant joke Kelly and the rest of the bullpen holding off the Dodgers over and over Chris shale comes in gets the final out a great team effort by a great team\nAnd we don't have dynasties in baseball any more but the red Sox are on quite a run and this may have been their best she should ever we talked about this when the world series started when you look at dynasties when I look at the spurs I'd Greg ... Tim Duncan\nSo I hide cornerstones there when I look at the patriots I ... Brady but with the red Sox with their baseball dynasty you had different managers different front office ... different stars\nSo that's the amazing part here this is more of a dynasty with the front office than it is on the field with the manager and with the star players but they did it they did it in a impressive fashion made it look easy at\nTimes but uh for the Dodgers that's getting there but not coming home with a victory All right to make love and got a poll question today\nWe could start with baseball right there is this current version of the red Sox I dynasty or titles Fifteen Years is that count as a dynasty\nI think this will be a generational dynasty I don't think this is what the typical dynasty is or what it used to be and we come up with different definitions of dynasties depending on the sport you know like the Pittsburgh Penguins would be a dynasty it would feel like\nThe spurs felt like they were uh ten to twelve year dynasty the patriots have Fifteen year dynasty now you don't win but you compete you're in the playoffs urine Super Bowls so it's a little bit different than what you would look at the typical baseball do I felt the Yankees\nYou know in a previous generation you know the late nineties that was a dynasty there yes she\nDid the players or coaches have to remain the same throughout that stretch it's tough to say that it's a dynasty when the teams don't look anything like each other from the first one to a lesser\nWell I think that if you have I I as I mentioned Brady and Bela ...\nWell I think that if you have I I as I mentioned Brady enveloped Shaq and I have Tim Duncan and great pop of it now it's different in basketball because it's only five guys out there in football gotta fifty three man roster you know baseball with the twenty five men roster so it's a little bit different um\nI didn't use to be you had a dynasty like the warriors are dynasty\nYou know those are the same players shame coach and you've won three and four years they're dynasty and maybe four and five years that's a dynasty there but with baseball it's just the definition has changed in what a dynasty use in baseball [noise] what else do you have the club\nOkay or if you are Clinton Kurdish homicide jump right in what would you do we do hopped out within three days or would you stay in LA I think you get sixty eight million dollars if he hops\nIn clean crush on did not know the details about his contract option and he did talk about it after last night's loss\nYou know I Know future questions are obviously coming for myself I don't want to take away from the Knight obviously and what everybody's feeling and never want to put the focus just on me or anything like that [noise]\nYou know I've got a I've got three days now to think about all that stuff before uh before anything happens and so it'll be an eventful through those for me and try to figure it out\nHe thought he had ten days which leads me to believe he's probably going to stay I Would think if you were ... you know\nUp to speed on the actual days of what's gonna happen with the next couple of years with your contract\nThen it would feel like you know maybe you were going to opt out but I'm looking at the numbers I don't think it makes sense now you might have something where Clayton Kurt Shaw says hey how about we redo a deal and maybe it's not up to thirty two million dollars per season if I'm ... and I said\nThat kind of money I ... and I would probably say how about we make a five year deal here\nLet's do that now you might say how about a change of scenery and you know I talked about this uh earlier in the world series ... not going to get his he wasn't gonna get his fastball back until next spring\nAnd so what he had was what he was trying to get through and the previous outing he pitched but you know the red Sox are just sitting there waiting you know they're sitting dead red and if you're gonna throw fastball we're going to crush you and if you're not going to be able to throw those other pictures he usually has a a variance of my fastball to my breaking ball\nYou know you got to have that separation that's what makes you so difficult to hit\nAnd if you're a fastball and you're breaking ball and there's not a whole lot of difference there the red Sox are to go to hitters but I'm looking at what he had the seven year two hundred and Fifteen million dollar deal he signed that before twenty four team and he can terminate the contract after\nThis season so you decide if you go out and he's already said to make sixty five million or he confessed free agency\nI don't know what his mindset is\nYou know is he a guy who says hey you know what I Do need a change of scenery maybe I'll go back to Texas or do I want to go to the Yankees do I want to try to win some place else man you got into the world series back to back years feels like many Machado would be the one that might not be back with the Dodgers that just a gut feeling there\nI Can't imagine if you have a manager who said\nTo Cody bell is you're if you're not going to run hard I'm going to sit on the bench and then you have many Machado who doesn't run hard\nThat's just because they that's not his style hey hit one eighty two in the world series but you know I think there's a bigger issue here with many Machado phenomena lock him up for three hundred million dollars I think I might move law might move on to the next prize there what else they love\nOkay if you're a major league baseball do you walk away from this World Series stoke the two great teams in there or concerned about the like\nThe game like the games what's your primary thought after that\nObviously I think he writes entertaining yeah I mean I don't look at it late yeah but I I I Know

I mean I did some games there in September will we go into extra innings in Boston\nAnd David I I don't know if this is Norma or what but he he went to the bathroom like for the fourth time\nWell he gets up and you know at times sometimes there's a quick inning when it comes back in\nThen you can picture this he sits down real quick because we're on the air\nAnd as he sits down and he puts a headset on I look to John John being I go I I had him stop I go John that's a great point I go to David\nWhat do you [laughter] and he had no idea what you guys are talking about we had no clue on camera of course you got to get their produce and he turns bright red and this was ... he goes\nI don't know what you're talking about I was in the bathroom because we start laughing he goes I didn't know I was working with two camels [laughter]\nThey're mad about it I should have shared that but I ... as\nUsual I drew a blank on on that story so\nWhat did you expect to happen in the world series\nUm nothing different than what we saw all year long um you know the Boston Red Sox dominated or the regular season\nUh we saw what they did in New York I I think probably the most impressive thing was um how they went to New York in the division series and won two games there they celebrated at Yankee Stadium\nOr they go to the world series the reigning World Series champion the Astros and they go through you know down in Houston and of course are celebrating out on their field and then you just you just even though things didn't go right now in game three when they lost an Eighteen innings you just you had the feeling you just knew when\nYou saw some of the interviews you saw some of the things that\nWent on with the club um they didn't take it as a last they they looked at that as a positive with uh the way some guy stood up a Nathan evolved the ah I mean come on now I mean a lot of people might not have even known his name\nUh your news out of baseball a couple of Tommy John's or I think you and I both agreed that I'd like to have him on my team anytime anywhere and\nI also think when you look at the world series in a lotta times we focus on the negative right after the world series we should celebrate with the red Sox did but it feels like David Roberts is going to be under the microscope for a little while uh what kind of thoughts questions did you have when or how he handled his uh his pitching staff\nYou know I think I I really had more questions about the handling of the staff last year in the world series and I did this year the the one big question Dan that I had that that I didn't understand was in game for\n'em he brings Kelly Jansen into pitch the eighth inning and I might be missing something here because I I did not do the series I watched it and of course uh uh you know when you're watching that you're at a party and there's a lot going on but what I didn't understand he brings dance and then with a four to three leading the eighth inning he gives up the home run a to Steve Pearce okay it's tied\nWhen he was talking about was if you ever play golf with Bill Murray again and you don't call me\n... it's a full so [laughter] I got a
