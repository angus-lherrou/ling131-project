was awake um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up in states of the union speeches having sort of little blindly to get through the night that's why she is seen falling asleep at of course there's nothing wrong with that uh um\nAtlantic Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the corner I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there\nA whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states has started hearing audio soundbites seven he is apologizing cabin on on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire capital family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified\nEvaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this covers right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in\nYou follow the script and all of that is in the past it not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin author openly promising that continue investigate Kavanaugh\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to another fire the other power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this\nIs one of the world over and so Trump is calling them out and I'm telling you folks this is crucial we don't I I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principal I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important the Trump do this as it was important when Trump at a rally\nExplained to the American people what the American media had not told them when he recites it the essence of her testimony\nWhen the drive by that that he was mocking Dr balls the Ford he wasn't mocking he was simply in forming the American people what the media was holding from them that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team\nIs born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\nIf\nIt takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nAnd that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history on I ...

the powers that be and the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to these people are we're we're not going to become them\n\nThey may have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not tell me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation well\nHow do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents gonna try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have an image to become who they are so given that how are they stopped\nIt's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything

I\nDon't think any of it was spontaneous and I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or she was also a storage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the cabin all would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as ... as it got very it

I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment or question and comment is\nIt's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that uh the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody is picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like this there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen it 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media\nIf instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival uh and safety\nBecause I think if the Democrats do not when the house and if you if you listen to scuttle bug sounds like everybody's preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expanded air hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixteen got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump's forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by ... trust shows them just even now after the cabin on hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here to Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and you know no\nNo officer you know\nOur government is separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this and well that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informed smarter\nWhat that's gone we have replaced\nPeople educated people learn in people with adults\nPlaced informed people educated people learn in people with Avon so load block\nCab idiots\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off into holding cells while their cases are educated so I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who\nAny other normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a\nQueen size zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancelled law and order and you're SUV get rid of that ... been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House states can be up for grabs be\nCause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families [noise]\n\nWell\nUh\nBut that wasn't explained to other night services it's a lot of Republican tournaments what yeah committee chairman are retiring cause their term limited\nForty three members are retiring some of 'em are committed Sherman and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members\nWhen you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention of TV Time you know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time there and the big bucks in the private sector\nAnd there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them but my my only point\nIs for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty Sanford retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy it will ... there were people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just to be tied over and want to take it all out of Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people's country hate Trump or an barest of Trump but that's what they think\n\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there in any even even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W. Bush was where they drove him down and it was six years anyway uh let me take another obscene profits break we will continue after that soon\nLou worked at a mainstream American media just will do rash of E R B men were\nPresident Trump and congressman Kevin McCarthy are working together to keep the Republican majority in Congress together we must protect the house that is giving you back your money with historic times you've got your jobs was drunk or trade deals and your security with tough border enforcement\nThe Republican Congress is taking power and money\nFrom Washington and giving it back to you but Democrats think your money belongs to the government wants to raise taxes protects criminals with sanctuary cities and reverse the twenty sixteen election within feeds\nThe Democratic agenda and the only way to keep the seat Democrats from raising taxes is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November ...

sometimes I Wonder you know how do they run across the U.S as a divine intervention because they they helped me formulate the things I Wish to say to you about this\nAnd he has a piece here about the

the United states is not by the way this is very important\nThis is the this is called well I you nailed this this is a description of how the left sees America\n\nAnd that view of America is one expressed frequently\nBy Obama it is this the United states is not a country founded by a common history or a common ethnicity\nAmerica is a set of values now think back to all the times you can hear Obama you remember Obama's speaking about 'em to vent that it happens or something that he had planned in legislation he\nWas famous those are not ... this is not who we are but we must be about ... or ... or ... and every time they did it while his\nValues are never mind and I'm looking at what he was talking about I Can't remember specifics here but just the idea that he wouldn't sit at ... stadium presumed to be the art richer\nAnd the person who defines American values while rejecting the premise of the very foundation of America how in the world can this guy's values nice tend to be\nAmerica's values when Obama and his Democrats reject the common principles found in the very origins of America but at this point is right on the money\nThat as far as the left is concerned we don't have anything in common we don't have a common history white people have a history\nAnd then the minorities I'll have another history and ... nothing in common and the white people have been illegally running things for their benefit for two hundred and some odd years of the minorities have been taken on a gym and it's about time that changed and that's what this upheaval in an overthrow it was all about\nThere's nothing in common there is no the minorities America sense no greatness in America hopes got to take a break\nJust rush is always at work but he I have never closes Fifteen

this that will use basis on which they organize the country so illegal immigrants\nChildren separated from their mommies by the Trump Administration has much more in common with the American left which has been discriminated in similar ways by the white majority since the days of the founding\nIllegal immigrants are partners in the struggle illegal immigrants and criminals in general are partners in the struggle against this progressive\nMajority would just denied fun and liberty and freedom to anybody but themselves\nLook at look at Kavanaugh himself\nThe first why they went after Kavanaugh was sexual assault than it was on the evidence for that there was no evidence there was no cooperation solved then it became that he wouldn't be fair\nHe wouldn't be fair because of this whole experience because they're angry because of his extreme statements while he testified it would prove that he was only interested in revenge and therefore he became temperamental late on acceptable\nAnd then it became amplified was judicial temperament was just\nNot permitted he doesn't have the values that we want on the Supreme Court\n\nSo he was accused of partisanship he was accused of judicial temperament he was accused of sexual harassment none of those things stocked so it basically boils down to the fact that he's not one of them and when you get right down to it that's what was all about the irony is\nThat Kavanaugh was chosen because he is an establishment guy and it was thought that he would sail through much easier than\nSay an Amy Coney Barrett who is

I I just I look at them with puzzlement like I cannot describe you really think that's what all this is a yes we've got to stop talking about abortion\nI said when did you stop paying attention to politics Twenty years ago where do you mean what is so far beyond that you don't even see it\nBut\nAt the heart of it is if we just change who we are then they will stop being so mean and that is not true and it is not the answer and it is not the solution because\nAnd it is not the solution because they have no desire to co exist\nThey are not energized by the intellectual feast of debate like

to wrap it up in national money to be able to get excited about the future\nBecause that's what that was all about the moon shot was all about doing things because we can\nDoing the hard things not the easy things I mean that that was just that was the whole goal and it did galvanized people think Scotland you know what people don't think about is Nineteen sixty eight\nIs when we went to the

reaching for the stars where is that America that says no not gonna stop me\nI I I ah I saw post today\nOr that I that I had to answer a in my Twitter feed let me see if I can find it real quick um that was it's actually this is so wrong what is being taught to children into it to everybody\nUm there was a a person Helen plot crows and apparently fat\nIs my identity and I belong to it whether I'm aware of it or not and even if I'm not this is what I've known for and I'm kidding myself to think people actually think of me primarily as a writer and speaker rather than a fat person\nImagine living that way\nI ... I responded uh uh to that\nAs a growing member of the fact community\nI find the real problem is when I look at myself in the mirror and I define myself by my body I Am more than my body you can define me any way you wish it's your last what do you say after I Am\nIs much more important than what others say about you\nSo which are we going to be America because the choice is here and the choices so much more than Donald Trump or Kavanaugh heat is so much bigger than this\nThere's no freedom there where there is no doubt there is freedom where there is humility there is freedom\nAbsolutely and you know when when you know intellectual expiration when when curiosity I'm going against the grain in any way when that when that becomes punishable um view I think\nI think they really risk a you know driving\nGood people I'm Down some some unsavory roads and there there's no good and that\nBrings a tradition out yeah absolutely absolutely ...\nThank you so much for reading the book and I'm going to send you they assigned to copy but thank you for reading and calling in I'm Daryl in Kentucky you're on the Glenn Beck program Hi Darryl\n[noise] hey how's it going I'm good how are you\nDoing great I just wanted to say that I really love the book and I think that my my favorite part of it is that even though we can't you can't surrender like you said several times we have to remain civil because maybe I'm not even thinking this but\nI think that eventually the blast will realize they have gone too far they will step back from the ledge and\nIf for civil if for their standing strong in our principles will be able to bring them back into the fold and I'm bringing the country back together but if we get in the same thing we're doing we're just healthcare the country apart\nSame thing we're doing we're just health care of the country part\nYou were on the left as well at one point\nI was um I was raised in southern West Virginia um my family or very deep blue Democrats and um we believe that Republicans were just people who took money away from the poor to give it to the rich and um\nYou know I I was pretty progressive guy in college and um\nI didn't really start looking at the other side until after twenty fourteen uh I went to war um I was a soldier in the military a\nSpin off two thousand fold in Afghanistan are leading some of the best men and women I've ever met in my life when I came back to my country was completely different I couldn't figure out what happens my I was no longer welcomed the less as a straight white male veteran so I had to figure out\nWhat happened and I started looking at people that I had mocked including yourself in the past and are\nActually started reading our ... Williams and Mike or various patio in which you noted in the ... and uh\nThat really you know maybe I'm buying into their theory a little bit too much but I've I've seen firsthand and uh I Do believe that you have another five years of of this getting worse before it gets better but I still believe Adonis Kelly\nSaid why it's whether or not um [noise] we can uh pull enough people away from the cliff before but I think ... years twenty twenty five where it starts to come back the other direction um it goes right so how can we help people like you because I\nI I I think we need to start defining um Democrats when we say the Democrats I think we need to start saying the people in the leadership of the party um because I don't think like you there are Democrats who are good love the country and are finding themselves going wait a minute I don't have any place to go\nAnd uh and we have\nTo and and I'm not saying it's in the Republican Party [laughter] I'm just saying people need to start being more welcoming to people who are finding themselves on the outs what should we be aware of that you went through\n[noise] I think you should be aware that even though the policy and is is an area that we may never agree on that principle is something that we can agree on that things like\nIndividual freedom things like um you know not just a having a government that and control you from you know several hundred miles away that control every little aspect of your life\nOr something I talk to my wife and my niece about all the time is that you know before before President Obama even though I voted for the guy like how like what he was selling um the president's name didn't get mentioned at the dinner table every single night at my home when I was growing up\nThe the power that we have given to Washington\nOver the past ten Twenty years it's too much and I'm not really sure what the end state what the solution for that is but\nI think just talking about the things you talked about in the book the principles that make us all United are are you know the bill of rights of the things that they make us all Americans are are what we can unify behind\nSo the the section of because I I mean I've really struggled with what it is that brought us together and it's really or can bring it back together and it's really so simple when you finally get down to it it is the bill of rights don't you think\nI agree um I think that you will never find in any other country that I've and I've been in several Africa Jeremy Afghanistan um Romania you'll never find a country that that beach itself up over its past as much as America does we\nWe realize that we've done some horrible things like you said and you read in your monologue but we've also\nYou know I think it's something that didn't actually sue the said by recognizing our falls by admitting to our faults you have to kind of in a way and to America's moral superiority because we realize that we made mistakes and we're trying to fix them\nDarryl thank you so much for your phone call appreciate it God Bless you\nBrought up a great point about how before Obama the president's name didn't come up every day at the dinner table\nObviously that's getting even worse now with Trump I mean people are a sense about talking about all the time the store today and actually it was about how they are the networks have recognized this and there are they're doubling down or they've enjoyed high ratings engagement from from coverage and\nFor the networks that are relatively low cost now that our president has been set around these high returns it's unlikely news outlets will cut back\nNow that our president has been set around these high returns it's unlikely news outlets will cut back meaning the barrage of fickle content being created an absorbed during the Trump presidency will likely outlive this administration they want to they want to make I mean like Trump it's a celebrity ... and he's a he's a polarizing guy and people love and hate him\nBut they want to change they want to be the norm they want you to be obsessed with this all the time at the expense of the rest of your life it is and it took ... regime it is the norm\nYou have to know what they're fewer or the leader is saying and doing and wants you to do it is the norm ... anything that normalize as as any intention of saying you know what that's good for America\nIs mistaken it's wrong\nAnd this is you know this is a it's driven I think at this point by clicks and viewers and you know it's it's one of those things that just because it's going to continue it can be hard to reverse that addiction is well they you know when when they can get you know the Rachel Maddow audience\nIs addicted to outrage maybe more than any other right their ratings have gone through the roof because of it and you think MSNBC is returned you know he's going to reverse that path now no they're not going to say oh well you know what maybe we went to I don't know I mean I'd like to be optimistic about it\nBut I don't see it happening All right I'm going to take a quick break back to your phone calls a day to day Seventeen Seventy six K than in our
