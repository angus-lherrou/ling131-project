a public email account which I Do\nSometimes during the break [noise]\nAnd uh I found one of the subject line love is high finance dear Mr Limbaugh I disagree with your assessment of what this election is about\nThe main voting issue is not immigration or health care is is that the Democrats voting base is a bunch of nuts\n[noise] I Wish that were true I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity\nThe psychological disorders and I mean that with every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters being psychologically\nScrewed up they are suffering psychological disorders because of things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country for it they want to blame the patriarch and they want to blame the founding\nBut then they they they claim that the only fix sport is the government punishing the people that did whatever happened to these people and the Democratic\nParty has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd has tried to normalize them all\nBy enshrine ing them as policy planks in the Democratic party platform if you will\nAnd that's how we ended up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving a whole way of the Democrat Party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which the otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\n\nI have tried to ... ... even before but it's civically sense of the capital of hearings to make the point that that's what we're up against the that's what it's going to end up triumph ing and ... if the Democrats win the house all of that abnormality is going to achieve power and when they have the power\nTo actually implement their forms of punishment\nAgainst groups of people they blame for whatever was wrong in their lives these are not people that are things that can fix things themselves they're not people that they've not been raised this way the Democratic party does not promote that kind of thing in human behavior Democratic Party is happy\nTo help them blame others happy to make them think they have no hope\nThat the deck is stacked against them because of whatever their skin color or sexual orientation their their their gender identity\nTheir religion whatever Democratic Party is helpful in making all these people believe they're justified in thinking\nThat life is miserable because of all these horrible other people what they've done to them and then the Democratic party to let us fix for DACA we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and the\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examine every Democrat constituency group that they've been representing the last take your pick ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy\nHave have their issues addressed and fixed or are they as miserable as they've always been are they is angry as they've always been if not more so are they still complaining today about things they were complaining about injustice

one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans that Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well

I voted for Trump I'm an avid Trump voter and them America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question here\n... how can the United states the ... with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we the allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty when the ... can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted it back\nOn harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and like I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spike us we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that he was either all Nineteen\nOr white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William Buckley junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up\nAnd I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it have to do with it well I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally\nAnd yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind\nThis I said how can we say that they're not\n\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam and that's what I started asking experts are at at\nOne of the people I talked to was anti McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor\nOn the blind shaped case and it was ending who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out and being a radical uh inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes when he found out none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right this\nIs exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he\nHe told me was so\nWhen you then realized that the Saudi royal family\nIs\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca\nAnd a Medina Medina\nAnd uh Medina Medina I've found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islam comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\n... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know what Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted\nWhile hobby as them and that's what I went back to Mr Buckley and so I I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve mom Mohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him [noise] he\nWants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship\nTo Islam all because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars of federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley and the typical places and other countries as well and\nPart and parcel of his reform is the word abandonment or and me are distancing from or how does it\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show gay again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less\nSaudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want ... watered down they do not they want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the ... this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they may have a council you might I often wonder well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSo Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be his air it's not just first in line they have a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe lineage of the crown prince the air's end in what order then saw him on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says if the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad didn't solve mom has crown friends\nNow many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what his son was just going to be the next king but it's not the case so\nAll of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cavity up all these plans for reform have been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of Dr Marcus show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi Arabia\nWould you feel scared ... could you explain that helping the people of Peru improve their own community would also
