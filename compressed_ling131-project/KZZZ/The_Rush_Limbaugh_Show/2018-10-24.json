there and that\nWas exactly exactly and this is why I was telling people back in June and July to polls you really don't matter a hill of beans I think however the polls now do\nNot so much in accurately without any doubt predicting a winter but the polls today can be highly influential\nAnd decisions and action taken by political people now I just I I Love Tonya thank you very much for uh for calling\nA ... and again for measuring Bob Ford it really is one of the finest dies anybody could ever meet [noise] uh\nI look at the psychology of people and I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly experienced here at analyzing predicting understanding the left\nAnd I know their mind set on many things one of their mindset on power is but it's there's that that they are entitled to it\nAnd when ever either denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American Left as angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them he left his making every every effort it can\nTo damage Trump to force him out of office divorce cabin all out of the nomination and to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate\nTo we can try but the degree of frustration they're feeling at having lost that election in two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently\nEverything they've had the most powerful influential people and their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump I cannot tell you\nHow frustrated they are it is easy for them to take out Republicans when ever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously but they haven't been able to even score on Trump\nSalt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fat they and they created a whole cloth something that does not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and then began reporting the news that way everybody hates Trump\nNow that they've seen Trump an action they hate him that despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became the narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumpet action they've seen is bad manners have seen whatever is about in the left taste now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated Trump everybody hated themselves were voting for him\n[noise] well it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue wave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that with soap operas scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the election and there isn't a blue wave of Republicans look like they're going to gain seats in the Senate even in Democrat Paul's and the blue wave in the house is looking iffy iffy and now with Republican turnout\nDwarfing Democrat turn out in early voting early voting is one of the Democrats get to run their frogs schemes folks early voting is rubbing illegals votes and the debt vote and all these other things it's purposely set up and the Republicans\nWhy it appears there are more sophisticated than the Democrats ever considered the Republicans are not letting the Democrats get away with what

surge\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the mid germs but this cycle presenting some unusual risks for pollsters not ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all\nThis out for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys a showing everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls picked it up or at least some of it\nIt's a good reminder that even mid October surveys scud missile late change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it ... but it it could it could go either direction Democrats can still win big or they could lose ... what is old isn't decision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the Swedes here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats to allow the Republicans to use this caravan which just so obviously is set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as weak and then ...\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop up posing Trump just to oppose Trump\nStop up posing Trump just to opposed Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we've we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and pay for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... smokes\nA lot of people on our side have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if it Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying is Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates and let those people and for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only commonsense nickel thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security that's doesn't help us a modest seven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWould have an audio say oh this is doing is illustrating what we'd support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\nMy point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI look don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats minute when the house but\nI I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groupthink narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now that argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump against Trump's what he's aboard each week she's a bad guy his whatever whatever is\nThe stumps the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters not for the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society standard\nGood old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture and left\nUs in Hollywood in Silicon valley and the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the church or not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip the scenario what\nSense
