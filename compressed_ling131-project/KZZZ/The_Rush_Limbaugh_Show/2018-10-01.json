call it is what gets rid of NAFTA just as he said he would do just as he promised on the campaign trail the new name of this thing\nIs the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us embassy a\nTrump has been speaking about this for the last half hour outside the oval office\nAnd he is an a fine fine mood as is everybody gathered there it is a major major achievement again it is something that the

with me\nI told you I was going to do this I told you it could be done and I told you the United states was going to come out as the champion in the subject the world trade don't doubt me and in that sense it's a confidence inspiring that Trump left alone in the oval office\nFree and clear to be who he is will me and I'm country great things happening for the country and this can be part way than to any number of\nCampaign ads\nFor the upcoming mid terms because it's going to be about a lot of things not just the cabinet nominations and other things that this is going to be a fundamental aspect\nIn terms of turning out the\nThe Trump base now the drive by is you know there there was a crime had a simple ask your questions about Kavanaugh's during the NAFTA thing and I and info bay from the drive by media persistent\nIn trying to start questions about capitalism which has led to a discussion about Trump now talking about the FBI investigation and I have to if you're\nJumping the gun a little bit and on and on this comment but\nI'm from friday afternoon\nThe minute by minute when\nYou were saying that the FBI was going to be called on to do another week's worth of investigating\n\nIt was a mountain lake clear to me what all of this is\nAnd it simply about one word folks it's about the way to lay and delay and with each\nNew revelations doesn't need to continue to delay\nIt secondarily about Kavanaugh that yeah oh they're still targeting Kevin offered total nuclear destruction that's part and parcel of this to the way it worked very simple you have Jeff Flake said he and cooling just struck a deal\nThat would be a one week FBI investigation of the claims made by Christine\nBalls the Ford never mind the fact\nThat she ... she doesn't have any evidence to back up or Clinton never mind that she is not credible\nTo another thing it's grading on me hearing everybody in the drive by many probably she's credit credible allegation of ... no it's not credible but she's being automatically assumed and described as credible and of course Kavanaugh is not\nCatalog Kevin O's not credible she is she has no evidence to back this up more corroborated at all\nSo the FBI says okay we'll do this for a week and immediately\nBefore sundown on friday a bunch of Democrats allowed a week long enough\nThat they sell me to\nLimit this than Trump right on cue said I haven't limited\nThe FBI NBC is lying about I haven't limited the FBI and the scope\nMeaning now Trump's on record and everybody is that if this thing needs to be on the week while it's going to go beyond a week and I guarantee you that is the objective here and that's why new allegations about Kavanaugh being a wild violent drunk to trace that\nDown Kavanaugh maybe having committed perjury about his calendars and stuff well we got a track that down um Kavanaugh may not have the temperament to be on the court given how in ranged an angry\nHe was during his testimony at the

this whole thing is a gigantic set up\nThe Democrats don't care about another FBI investigation that's just the trick for more than the way Kevin O's already undergone sex\n\nYou make six background information of background checks on cabinet miss the fact that he was such a drunk he beat people up which is the latest allegation somebody you knew him at Yale\nGuys now a professor in North Carolina has a piece in the Raleigh News Observer that Kavanaugh got belligerent lead drunk and he is seen it well nobody\nHas any ... information on on Kavanaugh and his drinking in last Twenty years old that happened was that Kevin I ended up number one in his class in high school\n\nIn college and in law school somebody so drunk so sloppy planning is next gang rape I'll guarantee you that kind of person does not become number one in anything decent\nWith Kevin all was he was number one in his class in high school and college in the law school capital has achievements Ninety percent of us wouldn't even bother to dream about\nThey are so daunting most of us wouldn't even attempt to them\nThey have to go back to high school have to go back to college to find evidence of binge drinking do that you're gonna find binge drinking on the part of a lot of people are going to find evidence like that today because don't you know\n... jump don't you know the stress of life in America is so so bad it's so horrible that there's all kinds of some medication loyal all kinds of people are drinking\nAnd they make excuses for them because the pressure is so intense but you don't find anybody testify Mitt Kavanaugh's menace boiled down beat him up drunk the last twenty five or Thirty years do you or even beyond that\n\nThat they said he he may have committed perjury if he lied about the people on the calendar Andrea he lied about what those terms mean if he is committed perjury is gone we need the FBI to look into that we need to help me out and look into whether or not he beat people up on yells campus\nAnd we need to we need to really track down this judicial temperament a here's why you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on friday he was yelling and screaming and that's not the kind of temper we want from a judge\nOr my buddy Andy McCarthy and makes a great point if you want to test if you want to see ... judicial temperament there's a place you can go\nAnd it is called the DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years and all you have to do is go there and study his work\nThere's an all you have to do is go there and study his work and then to the courts prior to that where he was a judge all of this is the ... the late\nThe way they hope to find new women drag new women out with new allegations they hope to come up with new charges\nThe ... minute one week's additional one week FBI investigators agreed to the Democrats started saying one week isn't going to be enough we we can't well we can was enough for thousands and hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton email James Comey is even gotten in on this\nJames coming now making no doubt about his partisanship and this and here's never Trump anti Trump status which is what all of this really is if you if you boil all this now what this is folks\nHatred for Donald Trump by\nThe Washington establishment by the American left by the media\nOn adultery rated do looted Raul poisonous hatred Brett Kavanaugh is going to be destroyed in the process of damaging and getting rid of Donald Trump\nThey want to delay this beyond the midterms because they aren't convinced they're going to win\nAnd when they when the hand the Senate House and set up that can impeach Trump they can paralyze the rest of his administration and if uh if if if if Kavanaugh what happened to get on the court to go to the gym to Gerald Nadler who runs the Judiciary Committee for the Democrats in the house\nHe's not even the chairman he's the ranking member and he's already promising to impeach Kavanaugh for perjury and whatever else that has occurred so far if the Democrats win the house\nThey can't stand it they cannot stand that Donald Trump is president they cannot stand that Donald Trump is putting a tremendous absolutely great human being and conservative on the Supreme Court is driving them historically crazy\nAnd so all of this all these new charges all these new suggestions for investigation all these calls for more time all it is is delay the next time you hear\nKevin oils reported we're very frequently in college I'm cutting rock and hit the ball in the fight\nSubstitute one word for that delay this is all about continuing to delay it which is why it is and here as it has always been at some point the Republicans would love to shut this down\nAnd call for a vote now as anybody else like me concerned I mean the FBI leadership many of them are gone but a lot are still there has done its level best to screw with Donald Trump working with the intelligence agencies we had that cabal\nConducting a silent cool to get rid of Trump during the campaign and then destroy his transition may have been trying to destroy his president so it was only Russia collusion the mother investigation and all that now that same agency with James calling me with an email now encouraging them to\nDig deep cheap ticket he told me he says there's got to be something they're\nThe same guy that exonerated Hillary Clinton without even an interview of the same guy that said they found new questionable emails on the laptop of Carlos danger and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there so they can do whatever they're going to do in a day or two if they want to\nBut then what happens if the FBI looks into all of this and reports by the way they reached no conclusions and if they do they will do\nA lot but if in the ... the ... the the the forms\nAnd the results of interviews if they produce no evidence for Christine Blasey Ford if they produce no evidence for any other\nAllegation if they cannot produced anything that's his cabinet did it whatever it is\nI don't know if this investigation clears Kevin like every FBI investigation here to for has\nYou think the Democrats 'cause oh okay well good we got a week now we can vote you think that's what's gonna be the hell no they're going to say the investigations not thorough the investigation was stilted my Trump the investigation was cheating the investigation was not long enough whatever they're not going to accept anything here at some point\nThey're going to have to be treated as the minority they are and\nAll of this just shut down and both you're listening to Rush Limbaugh the soundtrack of your conservative

you know when you up no ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop and say no fully as ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that exactly maybe it maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them maybe let's say for a year that's become them let's\nGraham said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and soul grams impassioned allegation\nOf the Democrats was followed by agreement\nJeff Flake [noise]\nMe that the FBI you allowed to do one way to get there by not all of fine senator Graham's point\nThat's the good their fight mellow fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like you can't do these things as one offs\nIf you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you'd have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated we shared it with your way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just has to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way it is you know there's not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even want to refute if they didn't care when they got a rise out of them was when Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter so she\nTurned around and asked her staff did you guys Lincoln but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein ever going to invest in some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be followed through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired of 'cause all they are further delay\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's ...\n\n... why is that is so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in Seoul\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility\n\nAn attitude doesn't give us credit ... pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out Kevin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up pay because voters are going to be fit to be tied up being let down again then the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this keeps up Republican voters are going to get kicked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening the capital and they don't want to management happening around here and there are going to show up in droves or I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed it in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin off where are the majority and we couldn't get a good first you need to come out in ... how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen\nKavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks\n\nThat what voters are going to remember in November is this\nThe unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there\nWere guaranteed to get their votes weren't going to there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Canada and then a Republican start campaigning and\nThey start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in\n\nAnd he is not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe majority\nWe know it's very small majority what are the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all of us Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted for\nWhat is that going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone\nWill be able to turn a cabinet to defeat him to turn out but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do\nVote for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout when you have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here in San rush Clinton needs to win\nDidn't people to see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't they really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here we have it also Kevin ... doesn't make it isn't gonna really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up\nThe base that doesn't make any sense to me you know what I mean the other way around this is another trick\nI think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up half or not doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what\nThe guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and they were supposed to say well okay man we're really loaded now that's gonna really caused the turn up the ... I'm Sorry cloth so I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is\nThat voters are going to be out there saying even when we voted Republican Democrat still run them down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected\nRe it's got to be the other way that the way this we have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of ah\nPeople who think their expert political analysts and they all\nWell not all what I mean a whole\nBunch of them have this theory that the way they get to the base all fired up we want to let them destroy a great life a grave patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win them in terms how does that work\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nOr is it one day when that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team why do we have to keep losing ... you're talking about a

only thing here is there delay tactics and that how you can tell that and I think we're up and all the honest enough to understand\nIf Brett Kavanaugh let's just say politics fail him and flake and Collins and Murkowski fail and the the bill comes down and he gets voted down\nThere won't be a soul who give a crap\nAbout this woman story they will all do they will not even she will not get a
