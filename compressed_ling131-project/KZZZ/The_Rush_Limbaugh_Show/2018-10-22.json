invasion ... is an invasion\nJust like that which occurs every day and has been at the southern border for many many decades I mean it's it's an invasion that has so far\nAnd lead to a minimum twelve million illegal aliens of the\nCountry and these incessant calls for amnesty for all of them\nBut let's see what happens when they are supposedly a week out let's see if the organizers of this thing began to deny\nThe members food and water\nLet's see if the people behind this creating a humanitarian crisis\nOne week before they're shed ruled a rival [noise] oh my God\nLook what's happening it's in the middle of the Mexican does or doesn't they've gotten out of water and there's no for like we've got to do with the we got to do something\n\nThere is a hurricane coming but Mike oh well it's a perfect storm that could be\nComing to fruition here\nThis is the ultimate October surprise that we're still trying to figure out who's behind this year's lonely Gohmert from Texas He was on today with the Sandra Smith on Fox question what can you tell us what you're seeing the way the president's responding to this what are your thoughts as this mob makes its way of the border\nThe president made no bones about it and uh actually he can take his lead from the Democrats a Democrat and I'm Woodrow Wilson not one of my favorite presidents but and I think sixteen ... gang came across\nThe border New Mexico and killed a bunch of people not only did he four Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and an age me stop\nAnd Louis continued to\nClose the border you gotta stop bogus asylum claims\nAnd basically have those claims for asylum only be allowed at our embassy or consulate in the home country where these people are coming from\nAnd also we need to remember that asylum claims are not legitimate if they're not married and if we're not the first country they come to after leaving their country so water Malala El Salvador Honduras they can't make a legitimate asylum claim\nAnd Jeff Sessions is not going to let that happen\nNow low a nose Jeff Sessions he keeps easy to talk to the lawyer he'll talk about Japanese talkative Jeff and I don't even know who is twice who you're talking about\nJust sessions with Jeff Sessions of big buddies that means he's talked to sessions about this but these are all great points they already qualified\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they tried to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it\nDestroyed take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives\nWould indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taking them for dinner recalls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage of the American people will realize their mistake electing Trump of the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason\nThe two thousands actually live germs the American people were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't believe it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue way of what's going to happen\nAnd we have that media narrative go on from December last year all the way through September of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue\nWave and Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it ever been CNN's own poll forty four percent Rasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly\nDon't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth\nI eat election day people have to start really enemies mad and kept for addictions projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who hired him\nSo now we're told\nWell there's been a shift a little then it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republican\nTo hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house with a month ago there was no way the Republicans were going to hold out now all of a sudden we're starting to see if it's a blue\nWave may not I don't think you'd ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up manufactured\nYou've got to pull result you want depending on when you take the fall and who you decide to put in your sample\n\nThere is no way there is simply no way that a political party openly promoting\nThis invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it or not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and the let everybody who wants to end in the American people are not there the American people never have been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\n\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people going to say yes and yet\nThey can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there there's a great way to make sure we have so much they have so little [laughter]\nWe must what the that's not\nThe position it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump won it never gotten the Republican nomination\nIf the people of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump what I never got the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think\nWe'd go up you know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall\nThis proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing to report are coming from ... countries left them that's not a majority opinion of the United states the media is going to try to make\nA majority opinion of the United states the beat it is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people\nSo I none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote care of him\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad\nGuy here and that's just not where the American people are one other thing about this [noise]\nNobody gets to the find a looming over by a second look at it this was a CNBC story from just this morning the headline

sides could become complacent because both sides now are revved up on like we've ever seen before it's all going to be about turnout who actually won the day comes says\nYeah I'm going to go vote and how many or just revved up now for you know valid reasons but then say am\nI you know speaking out is enough and knocked going out to vote\nIt's interesting because ah we've seen these the turnout numbers are generally they they've been applying lately to presidential elections since two thousand\nWe've seen a massive jump in the amount of people who are super passionate and paying attention at high levels to presidential campaign that's certainly what happened with rock Obama in two thousand eight and two thousand twelve\n... and it's also I'm One of the things we've noticed is in the off years that doesn't happen all that much\nMid mid term elections do not seem to inspire particularly among Democrats recently the amount of passion\nOr that has been ... coming from the right you remember two thousand tens Tea Party wave the biggest wave election in ... century basically she doesn't fourteen was also a little mini you know sort of Tea Party related wave\nA or a candidate for maybe as much Tea Party but they were still pretty strong year for Republicans in twenty fourteen in two thousand six you saw the opposite he's all Democrats are in the last years of the Bush administration have a really strong\nMid term in two thousand six but you know generally speaking people aren't as passionate the numbers\nHowever for this midterm election or off the charts and it's interesting Glenn was pointing out before a show that\nWere brought up on what was the sort of celebrity presidential candidate and he would have these huge rallies in two thousand eight and you remember that one in Denver I mean he\nWas he was like God he was ... it was like watching you to rewrite the Roman empire yeah it was literally like a rock star yeah and then it just disappeared mhm and\nIf you remember by mid terms you had these huge turnouts in the street but no one was going to see the president in those stadiums in arenas they still with both the arena but I remember just think bleak covering them\nRefugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh\nUnaccompanied minors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for that some after okay um all the October ones obviously after including then include the migrants a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but if it's high everywhere I mean it would ... the only place it's low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters each and if there before they're at fifty one percent which is the lowest number on most of these democratic ... demographic groups that you can find however it's also a lot higher than any other time and all of these elections the highest they had been before that was thirty nine perform and to try to say\nThat if there is always allies that this

[noise] he's a reporter for the Washington Post is he is he\nOr does he have a point of view that Washington happens to like about a a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you'll remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for being was to reject the west and establish global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool at harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism\nThey are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... to\n\nDo any administration a member from the Obama administration\nYou cannot\nCall them a largely secular organization\nWhen you read just their motto Allah is our goal the prophet our model look around our constitution jihad or plan and death for the sake of all of the ... of our wishes\nThey are not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad the industry of death\nAnd they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die noble e God gives proud life in this world\nOkay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nBut the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy but these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter\nThe Arab Spring\nThe Arab Spring praise by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate well it never materialized ...\nNo no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened\nTo the Muslim Brotherhood did they just choose not to do a caliphate\nOh no no they were overthrown oh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both ... chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism as a as a means to their ...\n\nSo ... year 'cause showed year whatever you're calling him today\nNow where you look at him\nHe is he is a guy who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood I Want to say this no one deserves this kind of death there's just not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all it's a Saudi progressive fighting for democracy\nNo no no\nNo he was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth editing editing out all thought crime\nMakes sure that there was never anything hospitals said about what hobby is them or the king during this time he'd cozy up to Osama bin Laden he scored several interviews while al ... was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be\nIn Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be the middleman between bin Laden and the Saudi royal family willing two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals when he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobbyist movement\n\nDid he do that\n... because he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the well hobbyists\n... was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an\nActive member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us we smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring he got out\nHe came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy like turning it against\nItself he wants wanted to establish sharia law in the region\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh Israel's outside the context of history and logic so we're going to have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote this man wrote that he ... it was a mistake to think\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam and his ... believes you have to use sharia law\nThat the constant wow it sounds like the ... the Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states\nIt's true they kill him could be probably seems like it I don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood and turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them
