you know what we plant for trees this is the word the industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees it's not a finite resource and for every three that's cut down\nFor new ones are planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's in zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want to cut down the redwoods I'm never come back you know I'm the same\nToken I remember saying well it's still true today there was another report just last

capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about they thought you know what you're talking to your side you can see this\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's

for the last I saw that we're going to get to the phones after the break in the bottom of the hour this\nIs the thing that I Know this is classic this is Trump said he never knew how just honest\nThe media was and then he decides to put Leslie stall in her play\nNever knew how dishonest the media was I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite\nI now I I never knew how to change the subject ... well no but even that way you ask me questions about separation yeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about now I don't know I was making gonna run your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject\nI disagree but I don't want to have that fight with you know hey if I don't get the nighttime I'm president and you're not in the mean\nTime I'm president and you're not reminding her oh he is ... she is talking to you know\nA lot of girls really rude what did you say that to her he said that she knows\nHis point was that he was not being given\nEven a modicum amount of respect similar to what other presidents have got yeah he's right about that these people despise him they still despise him and they're always going to simply because they can't get rid of it\nThey've thrown everything that they know\nI well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks in\nOkay All right I just want to

is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that and not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything ... distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there are some people who are on the left are claiming that she selfish and and trying to haul good what is a lot of light being shined on politics right now because of the\nBecause of the

sir\nI appreciate um thank you\nWrote them and just wanted to uh talk about the the movie ... now I heard you on your Thursday or friday show last week you were ah you were speaking about that movie so I decided to go check it out\nThat would be friday I was yes yes yes\nSo I got a moment after work I raced over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise] I wanted to I I I just wanted to portray how ... and he was he was a very very powerful movie and to illustrate that\nI just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie I'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff but this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now\nAfter the after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credit is finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nThey're smoking I Need to ask you this because this one thing about this I'm I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nOh we've got what but what what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] [noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was um I ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\n... what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over\n[noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the bar verity of what happens in those clinics but\nEven more than that was was that the white level what was the ... what happened in the clinics\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no and God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by sniffing they're spinal cords was scissors now I didn't save is on friday I didn't say\nThis on friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frighten people away\nIt's not\nYou I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director\nLets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lot of a special effect\nA real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers of children born alive\nFirst of children born\nAlive killed by this man is stunning and shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money uh done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what yet revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking rolled people like Nick Searcy who um a is a A N across the board actor he can take the lead it can take a supporting role he can take or [noise]\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run that go from the pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one did they wouldn't allow any\nWas Facebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all it's actually kind of a on it was amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a lot of hard work at a lot\nOf time to get this movie made but and it was a real challenge for um how how difficult is it to focus on\nThe fact that this abortion is did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of uh of abortions in the world but\nThe numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning you know everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion and it's called an abortion\nIf you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is but in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it the left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called\nAn abortion and\nThe the the the the the thing that left us tried to do in countering this movie is to say well well\nIf you want more God's nails then you go hunting overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing what he was doing the causes women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get that's a flat\nOut why by the way ... clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilized\nPeople that were getting sick and infected with it just it was a big stars in Philadelphia\nBut I didn't focus on that on purpose because I didn't want to I don't want to you because you don't\nSee it that's my point they don't graphically try to make their point they focus on a murder trial but good going\nOut there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating I'm nervous out there what does Russia want to hear what one of them but he got that it's not that I wanted to hear anything but that is what I think most people will learn that they didn't

true every single generation I think except for the last the boomers had to earn and renew their freedom\nThey didn't buy or sell the label the greatest generation that that that generation didn't have it wasn't them who came up with that title [noise] he was actually the boomers their children at the time\nThere weren't labels like we have now for every you know every subset of every generation ... people saw themselves as people and Americans they saw a crisis not as anybody's fault but rather\nOh crap their turn to stand and do the right thing is what they did with their crisis that made others years later bestow upon them the title the greatest generation\nWell I don't know if you noticed that but ah we're living in a time of great crisis set up people and I don't think it's going to India and be much different or a smaller scale than the great struggles of the past\nAnd in that struggle all of the labels that we think we have now will fall away all of those that have been bought will become worthless and every new label for each of us will be purchased with blood sweat tears or actual courage\nAnd what we face in the end\nIs not going to be smaller than what many of our grandparents or great grandparents faced in the world wars\nIt's not going to be any less frightening than the global economic unrest of the Nineteen thirties but it's not going to be

push themselves as a group beyond what humans thought was even possible to achieve something as valuable or as celestial as freedom\n\nThe crisis that we're now beginning to see is a blessing to blessing our parents never received each of us\nIt's kind of have to choose we're gonna have to pick between black and white slavery or freedom good or evil life and death the choices are going to be that clear\n\nWe will all know in the years to come who we really are\nIf we choose carefully who we really are\nOtherwise we will be painfully aware of who we simply allowed ourselves to become\n\nCan become through this struggle exactly who we were born to be our best and highest self\n\nIf each of us were honest and we began to see this struggle in the proper light we didn't

indeed why people still die in the middle of the night on the desert just trying to get to this side of the border\nAnd I ask you went on his question\nIs it really that much of a stretch to believe that you and I are not alone in our ... out of our doctors\n\nReally that hard to believe that our neighbor who knows how sick we all are really wants everyone who disagrees with their doctor to die\n\nIs it possible that our neighbors have seen the flaws in their practitioner as we have an hours but we haven't talked about that\n\nIs it really that much of a stretch to think that if we stop spending all of our time looking at what's wrong with America or what's wrong with them we might be able to see and search for the things that are right with America and good about our neighbors\n\nPerhaps were not as sick as all the doctors tell us are perhaps our doctors our politicians that are parties are more akin to bad crooked chiropractors that you've gone to and have done more damage to your spine than good and will continue to bilk\nUs out of every single dime week after week until we finally stand up and saying you know what no or we're broke\nAnd I understand why we haven't wanted to listen because most likely are friends of all said don't go down that road\nOur family matters that don't don't don't go to him and then you really believe venue far and now you're sitting here and you realized gee they're right and I don't want to be wrong I don't want to tell them that they were right\nThen again perhaps we are beyond help and we only have months to live but if it is that way I don't know about you but if we're going down\nI Want to go down with my friends in my family around me\nAnd all of them all of them even those who told me not to listen to my doctor or the one I angrily chased away because I just knew they were wrong I Want all of them by my bedside\n\nI think we should spend some time especially when we look at what's happening in Portland in and realize it's really easy to jump on the bandwagon and light fires\nIt's really hard to put fires out it's easy to lose\nFriends and family and chase them away it's a lot harder to bring them back\n\nToday there are four stories in the news that talk about our founding documents and our structure of our country our constitution say they all failed well ... no not really no they were just forgotten our founding documents really are only an idea that's it I think a really good idea\nThat says yeah we should all be able to choose who we want to be you know build our own life charter own course and be left alone if we want to be left alone or be or right on top of each other if we want to but whatever we choose\nWe can live our life with dignity and security that's a pretty damn good idea\nPretty that's a pretty damn good idea\nBut that idea has been failed\nIt's just that nobody really remembers it or believes in it anymore\nI still do\nAnd I think you do and I will bet you that your neighbor does as well\n\nI'm not a doctor well actually I Am I'm a doctor if humanity's which means I can treat any anything and the human body said listen to me here I'm I'm a doctor I think our illnesses all in our heads\n\nI think we've been convinced by those who suffer from some sort of societal Munch housing by proxy\nThen were fatally ill and will only survive because of them\nAnd I have to tell ya that's ally they need us to be sick and I don't know about you but I've had enough time in bed we're not as sick as they tell us\nThey've convinced that they've filled

the road down the road after we've done all of this hard work some other generation that will come along we look back and name and give a label\nTo us\nI Believe that label is going to be good I
