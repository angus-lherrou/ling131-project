now where every book circle Arthur Brooks\nFrom Arthur Brooks dot com or to make sure you listen to his podcast the Arthur Brooks show really smart guy really good guy musician um grew up in you know in the Pacific northwest I'm like it's kind of sounds like you're kind of had the you know a typical Seattle it'd be kind of family\nUh and uh went around the world it in a in a documentary I think the documentary is called a so called Arthur the pursuit 'em and um and he's got a fascinating life and it was just really searching for answers\nCame to find that capitalism is is what\nMade huge huge increases in happiness around the world and health so\nMy problem here ... ... and the only loose and I can't tie up is people like Rockefeller that have you know they do something because you know they're ... they they discovered oil and they were smart enough to put it all together\nAnd they accumulate the power and then with all of that money come corruption and they start to control everybody else's lives and start making all the decisions because they have all of this money how do you how do you reconcile that because I don't want to take the money away from people\nRight now I got a glass and you know it is distressing when you see something like a family where there was a patriarch it was a good entrepreneur but then kind of built a moat around the castle\nAnd that kept a bunch of wealth in the family for six generations and made it harder for other people to rise through crony capitalism that's a big problem that's actually not capitalism that's a different system that's a\nThose basically that's a system over wire deal so you could find in any socialist system any monarchy any place all around the world\nAnd that's something that we have to fight whether it's capitalism or or whatever ... whatever is on whatever economic system that we've got we have to democratize opportunity of the problem is not that we've got very rich people the problem is people have a hard time rising and we have to be putting our resources and our energy in our law in our initiative toward\nPeople that are at the bottom not so they can all get to the top but so then they can get to the middle the essence of the American experience them the moral basis of the American experience is that the the you know three generations ago the Brooks is in the backs were who were just like scratching out potatoes\nSome ways they're they're nothing more than ambitious riffraff who came to this country I wanted to get to the middle and support themselves and their families and we have to be warriors\nFor system that make sure that people can go from the bottom to the middle you know right now it's a very distressing thing you know you go to any good Ivy League university and you're gonna find that there's a system of preferences for legacies\nYou know if you went to university is four or five times more likely that your kid is going to get into that great university which all it is it's just saying\nYou got into the lucky genetics club you know that's that's actually not compatible with with a system of American opportunity with a system of equal dignity of experience so so that's actually what we need to be thinking about story about Google\nWere a lot more about the fact that people at the periphery of the bottom of our society can't rise today that's that's really an American thing\nIn camp they rise they can't rise because we have a discriminatory system unequal education were poor kids are locked into public education systems are parents who don't have choices number one number two is we don't have skills training in our communities we tell people that if they don't go to college there somehow losers [laughter]\nWe don't have a vocational and technical education systems which is the ultimate education reform we don't have an apprenticeship system in this country\nAnd most importantly climate we don't culturally value the skills that come from actually not going to college where people actually have a work skills where they can get when they can get ahead if we do those things we can really recreate the opportunity society\nHow did The Apprentice system go away\n[noise] but went away for a bunch of different reasons but part part of it had to do with the fact that you know back in the Nineteen until the Nineteen sixties there was a parallel tracking system in America where white kids would be tracked toward college and black kids especially in the south will be tracked toward the trades\nAnd and you and I know that one of the great advances in American society was the civil rights movement where we did away with stuff like that unfortunately there were some things are we threw the baby out with the bathwater white kids black kids every kind of kids should have the opportunity to succeed through hard work and skills and political initiative without going to college\nIs amazing argued that it's that early I think of apprenticeships and I think you know you're going back to\nAnd then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy and free enterprise and entrepreneurship because lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody's ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is an equal but what we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nSo I just this movie the pursuit that that that you mentioned in the last segment of coming out in the spring\nAnd part is actually filmed in Denmark Denmark has considered to be the happiest country in the world it's a\nIt's a social democracy it has the highest tax rates in the world about Seventy five percent of your income goes to the government and so I went there how into Denmark and hung out with some families there and the truth is\nIf you're into that you know more power to ya but I don't see very many people were actually trying to move to Denmark I Do see lots of people in Denmark that are trying to move to America why because of the antithesis\nPeople in Denmark that are trying to move to America why\nBecause of the antithesis culturally of what it means to be an American ... all you know Danish society Scandinavian society is built on the idea of don't stand out don't be different don't think the IRS something special don't try to if you so if you're\nIn this country America is built by oddball like you know like Glenn Beck and Arthur Brooks we're due to actually tried to do different things and in Denmark if you you know if you want to get rich or you want to start a company or you're really super religious like you and me or\nOr you want to have eight kids forget about it they're going to look at you like you're a freak\nAnd that's a big problem so if you wanted socialism is not just a social deal\nSocialism is actually a cultural deal and so and and and basically where everybody has the same amount of money everybody has to be awake as well so I feel like being a weirdo if you like being an odd ball if you like being yourself you better stay in America and you better make the American system better don't try to get the data system\nAnd that is one reason why it has been successful one reason why it is now falling apart and one reason why would not work here is there was no diversity there was no diversity now that they have open up the borders there's diversity and people don't want to live their life that way and it's falling apart my wrong people\nAre different people are different it's like if a country of it's a boutique society a five point three million people that the Danes they basically they're like ... [laughter] you know they they kind of live in the shower\nAnd then when there's a whole bunch of of immigration look for in America you know despite the fact that we have these controversies about the wall and about the immigration system and that a lot of people listening to us today disagree on this fundamentally we all come from immigrant so we all like immigrants we'd like hard working people who come from different places\nAnd integrate into our society most of most Europeans that they can't handle it\nThey don't know how to do it they don't think of themselves as fundamentally from some other place like a thousand years ago the Danish ancestors of current dangers were Vikings living in Denmark a thousand years ago I have the slightest idea where my family was but I mean God Knows they weren't in Seattle\nUm Arthur ... one last thought people came into it and they saw what they want it to be one way or another I don't think it changed anybody's mind um it was all about politics and the politics of destruction I think um\nBut we you know when when Lindsey Graham spoke yesterday kind of feel good do a lot of people in this audience and I thought it was righteous indignation myself I think there are a lot of people that feel this way knock it off this is shameful what is happening\nUm but there is a difference between righteous indignation and and playing the game the way others are playing it um they're they're playing for destruction\nIf we reach out and play for destruction as well I think we lose and we we have in our own destruction\nPeople think that that is surrender you what you want me to surrender you want me not to say anything that's not what I'm saying I'm saying fight the right way\nPeople kind of given up on being able to win a without playing dirty and you make a case that they shouldn't do that\nYeah I Know there were Glenn Beck speaks truth right now everybody's got a lesson this is the truth\nYou know there is not a long term or that comes from being a bad person but she like here's the key thing oh dear most people listening to us that are conservatives like you and me and there were watching the the the and they have a they have their own filter bubble look we all hear things through our own experience and through our own biases I got it I got it [laughter]\nBut standing up when in in righteous ignition look as your senator and you're in a hearing fine but for the rest of us standing up to the left standing up to the other side when they're wrong around the Thanksgiving table or on social media it has a very limited impact why because\nWe're not going to actually be taken seriously unless we hold our own side to the same moral standard so if we really want to be effective on the right what we need to do is we need to look at contempt and hatred and mockery and sarcasm and derision on the right\nAnd call it out and said these are not these arguments are not living up to my own moral standard and we hold ourselves to a higher moral standard we will not lose I've got the data on his client is and and the long run the moral high road we don't have to be weak don't have to give in to anybody else's argument\nBut to say through love and respect I Believe that you are not living up to your own objective and said our own side we will not stand for hatred that's not who we are that's the secret to long term success\nI I Believe that we're entering a time and yesterday I didn't only hates ended where people see this and they don't want to be a part of either side they don't want to be a part they're good Democrats who do not stand with an to enter bothered by that\nDemocrats who do not stand where they have to enter bothered by that um but I don't think they have anywhere to go because uh we had been painted as haters but also um we are we shot down people not the way they do necessarily on the left\nIt feels good to do that do you see any movement on the left that common sense Democrats are starting to say wait a minute I I'm not in lockstep with that\nI Do this is this is not what gets all the publicity screaming ladder is what gets all the policy on the writing on the left I look at the data I Seventy percent of Americans hate it\nThey feel that they're being out on that and again this half right wing and a half left wing Seventy percent of Americans believe that were being held hostage or being terrorized by powerful people who are profiting from us hating each other and saying terrible things to each other and they don't like it they they they they want to fight back we have uh\nThe the the opportunity to create a new moral movement where we can bring are brothers and sisters I'm a center left and even on the left together to try to solve some problems in this country and where we can say\nI don't hate you these kinds of what's going on in the Senate right now what's going on at the hearings right now as a proxy battle it's like an angle and the civil war where the Soviet Union in the United states are sending troops against each other in the Nineteen eighties\nTo fight it out of somebody else's battleground Americans have to say enough\nWith the ideological this ideological warfare between right and left and we're we're being the ones in the middle where we're effectively being held hostage we want better than this in this country we we don't have to back down from conservatives at all we just have to recognize that we don't have to agree\nIt's okay in this country to have actual disagreement that's the basis of our excellent you know your message has always been so good pled because you don't hate anybody and we have to as leaders we have an opportunity to help Americans to love their enemies and in so doing to find the basis of our strength\nArthur Brooks thank you so much for being on the program or you have to have you on more often you are a well spoken well thought out full of the facts and you're on the right
