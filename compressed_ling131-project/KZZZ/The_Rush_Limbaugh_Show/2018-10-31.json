white guy in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store\nAnd do we barely had time to a very long time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the

there is no white guy band\nWell there you have a my friends there is there is Don Lemon um we need a white guy band to go along with the travel ban andme a Muslim man because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white men\nThis of course ignores all of the people of color protest marches antifa who inflict damage and harm on people of course the black lives matter\nA group but you see a\nWhat's interesting about this are noteworthy about it is this is what is really thought of non lemons not alone here he just happened to be the guy to set it\nBut that happens to be the driving impetus\nBehind much of extreme liberalism they certainly that is what's driving militant feminism angry women they think white men at the problem white Christian men are the problem in

voting bloc Muslim Americans\nIn fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat votes than black voters\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the three thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand seven feet in Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yeah Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nIs white men we need a white\nMen than there is no white guy than\nThey have no one must ever blame the left no one must ever blame the news media ... all one must ever blame the rest of the Democratic party for any of the attacks done by their rabbits like Occupy Wall street like black lives matter like antifa\nThe truth is it isn't Republicans running around doing these things\nIt is a

have it Trump considered drop a sellout\nPrecisely because he has a daughter to convert to Judaism that's not mentioned no Trump is ratcheting down his visa had been pedaled or the metal and here's the opinion of David ...\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma say I'm Nineteen Ninety five and ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of like you know beat the drums\nOr to go out and and stock terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point in his presidency he was embattled winning with Oklahoma City that turns his presence around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works\nThere David Ronald Reagan's saying Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five and he ... he didn't go after\nThe terrorists he\nDidn't start in America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWill\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five ... in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other\nThey spread hey they leave the impression that\nBy their very words that violence is acceptable you oughta see I'm sure you're announcing the reports are some things that are regularly send over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who could even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the block with her as a result of the airwaves\nOr this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nBut the White House felt some have had the issue of corrections and all we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in camel gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this\nYou get right up but there's Clinton's zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me bombed out somebody said Clinton you didn't do that oh he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums\nAnybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of be the drums install the jurors all of them he tried to heal it was a turning this is again history revision is an extraordinary one more by this is Wolf Blitzer asked and judge Jeffrey children\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI read the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was president he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech who was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests see\nSo now there were no ... just for a bomb in there is no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nTrump's guilty that Trump's at fault but the protestors are right why weren't there any protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely me cause no left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three years ago and it it it was a much quieter and different time it was\nJust getting ratcheted up to where we're headed in any way that's like a break on wait long hair folks will come back and get started with us on\nSo you

caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they said they care about the situation that Democrats blew that sky high if that's what I Hope\nThat this was really going to help ... been the pipe bomb in the Senate actually come along and they feel like their motivation or\nEnergy level focus on those two things is interrupted by it and I think everybody else's says\nLet's pretend that some of the momentum was lost all okay we've got plenty of time we got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh\nWho did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one is that Kevin on confirmation circus we're about just\nIf the camera no confirmation circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused and so rape by capital if the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is it just does not being sought any longer\nAnd the answer the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess it's we need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon\nThe real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a Muslim ban we've got this bad we don't have a ban on white guys that we need a ban on white white guys white men have now become the primary issue in America according to the left\nAs X. told by John Lennon\nSo we're we're just drive by media we give it everything we've got an capital of it now drop it and move on to other things now Trump responsible for pipe bombs now Trump responsible for Senegal Russia Trump responds more Trump responsible for the airplane crash next week when I get around to that\nNone of it is real\nNone of the news is real it's all manufactured so what does it mean what does it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were so mistreated\nBy Kevin ... what does it mean\nThat the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kevin O's impeachment wise it's all been dropped\n\nWhy the media given up investigating the story they obsessed over for nearly a month\nFor weeks September and October that's all the media talked about [noise] where's the follow up\nIf Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice cabinet got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation\nSo is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the aftermath of the Jewish synagogues story it's all media manufactured not the stories themselves in this case but the coverage and the way it's being covered the fact that Trump is to blame that

with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was folks this was all and back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days of Ellis Island you you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to image shown new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundreds of controversy then was about legal immigration I mean even with legal immigration of where people opposed to opening up Ellis Island in preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to intercept the day\nThe differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed\nAnd we have both political parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship or amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats in the American left today are are advocating and they're doing ... on the premise that America is responsible for the economic\nPlight of these people that we as a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and taking what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life
