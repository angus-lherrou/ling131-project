of election\nWashington Post headline\nTrump every Republican several on fear and false ... as a mid term strategy\nSame paper\nAll through the two thousand sixteen campaign said that Trump would end

Florida which is you have to begin in person voting\nEntire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\n\nNow that that's somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is the Democrats are growing up in the early Italy and\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for that on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and there again this is NBC News\nSo the question here ... hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to a convention wasn't conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts that the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stole that election from the Democrats have been motivated like you can't will lead to get out there and make this right\nAnd correct it and fix it they haven't been inspired David energized they've been motivated they been donating they cannot wait and yet\n\nIn eight key Republican state key key battleground states

happening but nobody in conventional Washington\nElitist establishment Washington would you ever think would happen these people come up with their story they're stuck with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized and they get that in their heads and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens\nAnd they don't know

chance the Republicans lose the house eighty six percent chance of Democrats when how does all this fit together well\nIt doesn't obviously\nYou have Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\nMust mean that something is drastically wrong here something is terribly wrong and the formula\nFor this kind of Republican enthusiasm in an off year mid term election where so many people quote unquote hate\nTrump just doesn't compute\nThere ought not be this much Republican early voting action there ought not be anywhere near this kind of a doozy

crowd\nAnd Obama is out and he's in you know these these rooms that are like\nFour hundred people maybe ... maybe tops two thousand and they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms 'cause he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms\nIn Donald Trump still has these gigantic crowds and\nAnd listen to what can we played Sarah the audio that was

a\nRobert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name or ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans I thought were a little\nUm [noise]\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate or for any quarter in history thirty eight million dollars for Beto just for him that's not all that link\nThat's not including the Soros money that is going into the state outside a Jack of money and tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the care of and and also about what's happening\nOr directly to candidates in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded the ground game stick it out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a man to\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for candidates like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities in blue counties you have a Dallas year after year that we have San Antonio you have all that and you have El Paso and so you have these massive\nBlue regions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the passion of freedom to back to the liberty or in the past she lived conservatism so uh every vote counts in and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were\nWe really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were ah it last night where we were from Texas I'm I'm Sorry what people are fired up and they are ready but we need people to go about\nTell me a little bit about the caravan is there do we have any idea other than the you know political leanings of this group\nOr when it was back in Honduras do we have any idea just the logistics who is behind this and what we're prepared to do\nSir I've had the opportunity to speak with both the secretary of homeland security as well as the president about this\nAnd I I can tell you what I can tell you publicly\nAnd and that is or if you think these are people who are leaving Honduras or about a mile or wherever they are coming from or just trying to escape violence and income seek asylum or that is incorrect\nOr this is very well organized it's funded has a there are there are others who are behind this and very importantly a end this caravan are not just people from Honduras Guatemala a we know that some of the leaders of it are are involved in their midst Thirteen we don't we know that some of the people in it or from\nCountries across the entire globe are there are what we use in the lingo SRAs liquor a special interest aliens who pose a a very real dangerous threat or to the security of the United states of America as it were better in these caravans\nRight ... Univision just reported this morning that there were people with terrorists ties ah from Malaysia involved in in the editing this\n... and and I've heard the same thing with ... with regard to a terrorist coming from countries other than Malaysia and think about this if these people really were trying to escape by horrific life on whatever country they're coming from\nWhy is it that they are marching with the flag of the country that they're coming from mhm you know they they\nThey are not coming to the United states of America to make the United states of America a better place they're not coming to the United states to ... a ... style him from the dangerous they have in fact it there were multiple reports on TV last night and you can look would have shown that\nOf the interviews with these people in the Caribbean and they were talking about what was their strategy or when they get us and they said it was very simple when those numbers\nAre overwhelm United States' ability or to uh go through the salad process for all these people so they they have been taught him know already that their strategy is to\nBasically rushed the game so much that the U.S loses control let me tell you something if we lose control of our border\nThey released lose control of our sovereignty\nWe're no longer a sovereign nation and we must step up and use every tool that we can to make sure that we put an end to this care and because I understand this clean also on that as this maybe two or three or five thousand people\nBut they make it in right behind him in the air out of twenty thousand people a lot behind that will be a caravan of fifty thousand people and the United states of America as we know it will be forever altered who don't do something to stop this\nYou know the price is going to treat us like the Israelis and the caravan like the Palestinians\nUm is the president leaning on the president of Mexico and\nThreatening to cut off all I mean if I mean I think this is the time to really lean hard and say this is not our problem turn them around or we'll cut off all aid with with Mexico is there a chance of this or\nWhether the president has been outspoken about cutting off aid\nTo Honduras and brought them out right now that the United states is working collaboratively in in in this might be hard to believe so I Want to emphasize that uh the U. S. is working collaboratively\nWith Mexico Mexico has made a decision that they have not made over the past Mexico is working with the United nations or to try to work on\nA temporary settlement of these care band members\nIn Mexico El Paso ... Mexico's is is actually playing\nA ... a very beneficial role in this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing or at least as of this moment in time\nOr they headed towards taxes no no invasion plans of the United states with a former Soviet Union ever included Texas because they knew Texans would not take kindly to the invasion force are they heading towards a Lexus or California\nI Will tell you what are what was reported publicly last night and I will not disputed and and that is a early on before yesterday on there was great concern that they were headed for Texas and it was reported last night that they are headed toward California\nNow that makes sense because as you know California is a ... state yeah and and ... they were\nCalifornia is a ... state yeah and and ... they were welcomed this caravan and tip or caravans like it\nAnd and and these care by members and the leaders of this caravan that they understand one thing and that is a if they try to reach the gates Texas or we're not going to tolerate it and we're going to be very\nUh you know protective of our sovereignty here and so uh I Can't tell you are starting to right now where they're going ah I can tell you what was said and what makes sense and that is they may be headed to California\nLast question that one is the\nWay the same as you know what was there in the United states there in the United states right now and wants to hear that they can migrate anywhere\nRight um the your campaign is going really well you're a great governor and um and I don't think your election is a is a good to be um a in jeopardy at all\nHow is how is a Ted Cruz how how is Ken Paxton how is Dan Patrick\nWell listen all these all these races are closer than what people will\nRealize and it is because uh we we need to understand that this the liberals or a socialist whatever we want to call them these days uh they've got what I was their forces coming out to vote early and so uh is too hard to tell right now\nAnd because they are so close uh I Am going uh across the entire state of Texas campaigning every single day in multiple cities to help\nA Republicans up and down the ballot to make sure that we are going to have policies that are antagonistic to to open borders to make sure we have policies that cut your taxes that cut your regulations or that improve our schools and so it was very important that people turn out\nOr they vote or your listeners have a lot at stake in their own personal lives uh baseball is going to happen in this election\nAnd everybody's going to matter because the voter turnout is it sky rocket levels right now\nAnd if you're listening and you had a voted you need to go vote because your future is at stake but today for example uh when we hang up I'm headed to\nA belt and decode campaign for some people they aren't going to be a in Dallas County later on today I'm going to be in ... county later on uh\nIn in the week and then parents coming out for them to spend a lot of climate north Texas and in South Texas east Texas in West Texas or to make sure that we win these elections from the top of the ballots at the bottom of the ballot\nGreg always go the good stuff do you think you've got to appreciate it God Bless you God Bless you have to stay there [noise]\nGovernor Greg Abbott of Texas by the way from Texas a matters or to you\nTexas goes blue\nYou then have New York\nYou don't win an election again\nThey have taken the electoral college uh every single time\nTaxes must remain bread and for another reason we're creating anywhere between thirty and fifty percent of all of the new jobs in America are coming out of Texas\nAnd new why do you think that's happening [noise]\nSponsored this half hour is life lock\nFor more than three years software vulnerability and Google Plus social media network gave third party developers\nPotential access to users private profile information\nMore than a four hundred and Ninety thousand users shared private profiled data with a friend they may have had their act their files access to Google says no evidence any data has been misused but it could be misused at any time\nWith your personal information from data exposure criminals can open accounts file tax returns and buy property", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "23"}
