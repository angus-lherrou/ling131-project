the point of absorbing all the new people that want jobs so why is that\nWho in the world could be unhappy by this who could be made unhappy by this the answer is very clear I don't want to give it all the way I told him that I think\nWhatever arguments we're having here they are still\nAll circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need to continue to vote Democrat because only the government can provide for people only the

that government chair that government takes a while the more independent success people have\nMore people rely on themselves get jobs improve their lives just the fact that Democratic Party gets mad

E. C. K. or with your comments and questions and maybe you have some questions like we do on this Saudi Arabia and killing I you know I don't know why we haven't\nNewt Riyadh yet why I don't know why I mean a journalist was killed yeah ah that much we kinda know so usually when that happens we've destroyed the country by now usually what you do write new just willy nilly started launching missiles at it I Love I Love the way the media reacts\nTo the stuff the criticism the main criticism of Donald Trump since he's been in the public eye in politics is that he react\nReacts to quickly jumped ... he just jumps into everything and he's he's constantly he's a he's a loose cannon he might knew everybody out about the new thing every Friday [laughter] actually trying to gather facts yeah would you do I mean look it to me it\nSure looks like something really ... bad but again all of that comes from Turkish sources Turkish sources with an incentive to make Saudi Arabia look as bad as possible so until we actually have the evidence or at least\nOur intelligence services have the evidence it's hard to jump to a conclusion and do anything a drastic\nAnd the criticism that it's coming in a Trump is he saying well look we need a we've asked for the video we've asked for the audio that supposedly exist that's been described media reports but we don't have it yeah mhm uh we've tried we've talked to them about it we we were investigating we sent my palm pay well over there to talk to them about it\n... I mean you ... I think\nThe same people\nWho we heard for years and years and years and years we did not do enough research to figure out if there was weapons of mass destruction\nIn Iraq and including Donald Trump by the way who was who was leading that at the time ah or at least commenting publicly vary a lot on that\nNow we're hearing from the same media people that we should be jumping immediately to we absolutely know it happened and how can we haven't punished Saudi Arabia yet\nYeah and I think that that's been the transformation of of the news is that everything now is seen through a Trump prism\nAnd clearly the you know the Saudi Arabian explanations have been suspect there's first of all they didn't know anything about it at first ... well he was gone and he left a we we don't know where when hoops well we never saw him leave out the front door ... do you have another yeah he went out the back window\nI I don't know and then and then it's well okay yeah he's he's dead or a we killed him accidentally during an interrogation gone bad though I Will\nThe oil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nA cheese crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would think\nNow look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a

with that you would ask I mean what's interesting Jamal I'm fine I'm Jamal Jamal was killed at the end of the ... we can all say it was ... and what does all know Jamal\n... cars shaggy or ... ... and then whatever the pronunciation is tomorrow but\nYou're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind it probably is irritating yeah it is\n[laughter] it is I I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen\nWhy why did that happen it's even less or a ... couple\nRight the here you have a situation where it is the name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that Osama what to do some I think she was a letter [laughter] and he just said no no no no it's a it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in ... the last pick\nI mean like ... when this happened ... the guy is dead and you know whatever ...\nYou know no one ever said you know Osama as wrong it's it should be Usama Osama and why no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange it is very strange uh and like some of it I I get to understand like for example a here we'd say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monica right mhm and if you're over there they call it ...\n... everyone calls it Morocco no I've never heard that I Will say here's another one here we say monster\nFor the

wouldn't get into that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off if you have ...\nYeah they'll call it matters that were not stuff that we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called Jackie what you are on the commercial on a jaguar\nWhy [laughter] it's like they like if you come up with a name on\nYour own maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what is a word we already know and why they were a hundred years it stop it we it's an animal yet and they're not just a car it's an animal to right now what do you ever says jak you are\n[laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that's yeah I think that's jak you are trying to seem refined right like it was like if there's something nothing a little snooty about the way they pronounce mhm er jaguars like at the the stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog\nHad lifted Jackie water [laughter] would you be calm [laughter]\nThat that was over there right but if I have been turned into my dog a terrible I'd but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it though everything's going to be okay [laughter] that happens is you know than it three times last week alone for me and it was fifty some for you over the last three weeks okay oh no wonder [noise]\nSilly so weird I even get yourself so worked up about that I Know what I Hope happens every day it every day when she brings breakfast to them they asked her well where did this\nFor money [laughter] they just torture her with the rest of her life [laughter] and you can I can understand that you know sometimes I I think even\nYou know like conservative get made fun of when they do these types of things uh like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it's like I was a captain planet or whatever and all that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is emitted yeah you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this one will know might have been type of pig or something it's usually pepper pick I like to pick a lot\nA and a pet or it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking in the recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for recycling I think there's some some uh there's some conflicting evidence as to what good does a there's\nBeen several studies that have shown not much not much if any clearly you work for al ... apparently not know but uh yeah like I don't know do I really need a giant a commercial about environmental is among my kids programming I Know and I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff\n... you know I mean you can get a little a little fire it up with trying to find the political messages and these things even if they're there I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adults second thing for themselves\nAnd you know you kinda have to at some point\nI realized that you're not going to be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know a very worried about uh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and and at any point they're going to be an assault going on and\nYou know I mean maybe this is this is ...\nIt'd be an assault going on and you know what I mean\nMaybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just\nIt's a little ... it is and I remember when people were concerned conservatives were concerned mostly uh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movie like\nI'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those\nUh there's a scene where the character's going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman a on the ... in one of the buildings they passed that make it\nFor just a ... I remember hearing over that yeah yeah so conservatives would talk about that and it would be oh Dopp but you can't even see that that's it's subliminal you don't even know which there and then there was the lion king a scene where a\nSimba as as a grown lion\nHow to plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nIf you ... [laughter] residents yeah ever that but we were in the same for talking about any of that yeah oh ... that's nonsense\nBut you're supposed to tell your kids or you need to ask where's that apple is from why why do I need to eat the apple where ...\n... she's saying that rape culture is happening yeah Disney yes and that's a terrifying message I was ... or send the children [laughter] although we've we've had this before I mean the ... the one I Would think about Willie walk on the chocolate factory\nWhich is movie African love I mean I Love that movie but what happens at the scene where they're just going through the tunnel and in all of a sudden like a really quick like subliminal things you'd see like a chicken get its head cut off [laughter] that could walk into the children's movie it's terrifying that whole scene is terrifying\nI like I don't remember that yeah oh my God they they go through the tunnel and it's like really like psychedelic and weird and like I said I remember that being yeah why wouldn't close that what's going on in there it's not good [laughter] I'm really sorry she gets his head cut off like this like a career out\nOf this is why I'm bringing them making me think I don't know it's I think as opposed to the scene is supposed to set the like off putting a like it's supposed to give you an off putting feel like it's supposed to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening and you see like\nThe scary what was the guy's name or with the with the ever left alas he wanted the everlasting job stopper and he kept harassing the poor kid\nFor it and then he worked for Willie walk at the end I don't remember a cat once they've squid word but that's about ... I got a lot of things messed up in my mind that does happen and then he's going through and it's supposed to even that weird like you're almost dizzy feeling yeah and they flash like a bunch of really fast images and want to like maybe they just cutting a chicken\nHead off in the very strange very strange yeah so we've been tortured with is up for a long time and look how well we turned out the world's fine right everything's going really well I Can't\nSee how there be any downside [laughter] I I guess you can get to that\nPoint where your over your over parenting right oh definitely and I certainly have to be the way\nUh you know that things are going now we we um we recently started a letting our son ... ... I I listen to Lenore Skenazy a lot she's been on the show before she started an organization called let grow and a ... a free range kids\nAnd basically her mission in life is to\nMake it could do some things yeah like you don't need to helicopter parent over them all the time she's famous for uh she lives in New York\nStill doesn't believe and she let her nine year old go on the New York city subway system by himself\nAnd she was called the worst parents in America and Europe ... honestly my immediate reaction when I read that story initially was she is the worst parents in America right like your ... year old on the subway by themselves like\nI Can't even imagine the amount of panic I Would have but then you you could do it I don't think I could do it either um what'd you step back and say well wait a minute like\nGeorge Washington was like I think he won the revolutionary war eight years old or something like this and then we went through a long period of time where people were\nAre supposed to be as kids are much more self sufficient you know I Know when I was a kid like we would leave the house and we would go play at a friend's house and they all the time the time will be gone the whole day yeah and that whole thing about us coming\nBack and um you know you come back when it gets dark or when the streetlights come on ... and ... like it's ...\nUse that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than what's not even true I grew up in the nineties this is like the eighties and nineties more the eighties but no I was getting my wrist in America by far\nDangerous than now there was a much ... I mean the crime rates were all hire a murders were higher kidnapping for higher everything was worse school shootings were at a rate of four times what they are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over a school shooting in my entire\nThere are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over a school shooting in my entire life I think we get to that point where we're just we get so freaked out we recently had our you know we have her son like walking walking her dog with a little shore and he's doing it by himself or just up the street a little bit and back and I can tell you just that\nFreaks me out like I ... everything in me not to walk to the end of my driveway and spy on him to make sure he's okay the entire time and I don't know why that is that certainly is and how it was when I was a kid yeah uh and I I I somehow live through it I think that the the the instinct there is to just\nSure you're mentioning every little thing that you could go wrong in their life so that if that thing does go wrong you can't blame yourself\nYou know it's like it's almost selfish instinct where you're just like wow at least I told them I I remember telling my kid five hundred times not to go down a dark alleys and they went to a dark alley and well it's really sad but at least it's not my fault that that that's not a really healthy ... parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it\nBecause of course you don't want no one wants anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut it's a dish and all of that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid walk down some a street and were something terrible happened because everyone's going to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy\nAnd I think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure this is the boat she's in her ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything to a four year old reading Cinderella that's going to protect them from rape culture that's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after a while I was reading Cinderella or watching\nOr the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from\nSymbol falling down and blowing the word sex drive to the year from the dust ah that's going to mess them up a lot of teen pregnancies cause a lot of Tripoli Seventy Seventy easy care [noise]\n\nYou know that feeling when you just know you're experiencing a whole new level of excellence I have felt it a few times a first luxury car even my first iPhone you're experiencing a game changer that is exactly the way I\nFelt and you will feel the first time you said in an ex chair I knew immediately the generic chair they suck and we spend so much time in those stupid chairs get a great chair\nAnd ... chair most of us spend more time in our office chair than in bed that's why the ex chair is so important ex chair now on sale for a hundred dollars off they'll do X chair back dot com right now that's the letter X", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "18"}
