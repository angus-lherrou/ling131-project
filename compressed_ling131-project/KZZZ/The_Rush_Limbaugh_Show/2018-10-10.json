up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody's that kind of science and they aren't they everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad guy that was ... and now they talk about it and it's almost like you know we live for about it like ... ... ... ... oh\nYes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that this date and if the regime was listening to them\nAnd so you're basically this driving describing the same thing the difference is that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot leaders so\nYou you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in yards but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not all the countries themselves\nWhile you're concerned about violence to share it let me grab soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul he was on Fox and friends today and uh a nationally easily Earhart or should you have a big fear that this rhetoric your fear is that somebody's going to get killed\nSomeone almost do it I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died\nFrom a very very angry violent man who is inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to\nTwo hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... he was yelling [noise] this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket and he was willing to kill\nSo what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down\nAnd I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to say please the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think that this ... unhinged behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger and the on his behavior justified on the basis of the trumpet so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nBut there's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little it'd\nBe more responsible they don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of on the ... I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know of better when\nI many times can you call 'em insane or not right or mentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value\nIn these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building and confronting people in elevators and basically frightening the\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes to get done what they need to get done so don't don't think that they're going to get a dose sensibility\nOr responsibility and ask for it to be dialed back and part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of unleashing misbehavior on themselves\nA bit of on leashes misbehavior on themselves\nWhen I used to be said Russia ...\n... you're not a good windows doors were ... digital business owners who rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can save a ton of money and owned your own building with\nThe incredible tale prices from general steal this right now you can save as much as half the time and cost of conventional construction and stop renting speech from others just go eight eight forty one steal you see how general steel can help you save money or fifty years structural warranty buildings are custom designed for your needs you can get a forty by sixty foot building\nFor less than twenty five thousand dollars for a fifty by one hundred clue spanned building under forty thousand dollars there is no wasted space and construction takes half\nThe time called eight eight forty one the only strong construction spending in high demand\nThis special pricing will not last long eight eight forty one steel and get your options and pricing package on dozens of building ... eighty eight forty one steel and see how general steel can save your money ... eight eight forty one steal a date for one Seventy eighty three thirty five eighty eight for one seven eighty three thirty five\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy named Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he was diagnosed with cancer stage four and here's the thing\nHe had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills so the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work\nOur medical bills exceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars Medicare never shared\nAll our bells and it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without him at a sure it's\nSo worth looking into there is a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nHave five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.
