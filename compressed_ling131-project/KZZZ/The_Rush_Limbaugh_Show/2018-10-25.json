about the headline Americans anger may help Democrats in November six vote as soon as they Rogers Ipsos poll\nAnd the are the best stuff here is ah is at the\nBottom a\nSense here that the things that democratic voters are the most angry about our children in cages and Kavanaugh ending abortion\nAnd that that\nDemocrats anger is off the charts it's skyrocketing and it's relatively well compared to Republican enthusiasm democratic anger is\nOverflowing children in cages and Kevin ending abortion both of those are media construct we don't have kids in cages it's not policy and cabinet and abortion nobody knows what's gonna happen it's ridiculous\nBut but writers have destroyed Democrat anger may help Democrats in November sixth vote and what did they manage\nChildren in cages in capital and think more so I just don't believe in the I I think [noise]\nI think that Dr ... are still attempting to manufacture of scenarios they wish were actually happening in this country I got an interesting email Mr Limbaugh you have made it abundantly clear that you can damage the use of bombs\nFor political advantage in American politics but we'll you condemn the use of fake\nMailbox\n[noise] now that's a toughie I have just been challenged to condemn the use of fake well of course I watch that's not a that's a that's a number of course I Will condemn the use of fake mail bombs as well\n[noise]\nIf they're fake if these are all fake bombs we may not find that out till after the election because if these are fake bombs then who would be behind ...\nWho would what would the odds would be [noise] so I think you better prepare yourself for the fact that they're fake bombs and by the way this emailer is not the first person who has\nMade that point a lot of people are out there thinking these are fake bombs that's why the the the the expertise needed to manufacture a fake Bob like this that\nThat could be close enough to cause mass reporting on the being real is a it's a pretty good talent so do you think one person who's behind this or is it a team of people\nWould would anybody say that what we have here is meddling in an election you think this was the dried vice clearly think this is meddling in that election and they're happy about it Dr vice clearly are happy to report that they think that this bomb business\nIs making view Republican voters less excited less enthusiastic that this bomb story has totally destroyed all of the energy you and that's what they're reporting out there\n\nIs that what the media is trying to do with all this over the top coverage of this Trump targets bombs received by Trump targets\n\nIf this is indeed the election meddling depending on how it ends up here this could be a pretty successful case of election meddling\nAnd we don't even know if this is per se or a perp we don't know if it's a Russian government agent or operation we don't know who is behind is whoever it is doesn't know how to spell Florida\nCondescension about things\nThese are people that are really in genuinely going to put this nation at risk in isn't Donald Trump putting this nation at risk\nIf Donald Trump that is helping to with draw this nation from the jaws of risk and transferred her risk to our enemies in his Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nSo our enemies in his Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama at all who the smog leftist seemed to adore\nWho put this nation at risk in so many ways economically foreign policy intelligence you name it and they have the audacity to chime in on this so called stupidity and ignorance of Donald Trump\n\nI just some days it just gets to me it just ticks me off another Trump tweets\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting in the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it's gotten so bad and hateful it's beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\n\nEvery word advantage true they're out they're calling Trump Hitler calling him not to you know the New York\nTimes published a story yesterday the day that this bomb business started the New York times on a story yesterday fantasizing about Trump's assassination\nYou want to talk about lack of civility you want to talk about public\nDiscourse the New York times yesterday October twenty fourth published a fictional piece imagining Trump's assassination at the hands of a Russian and the secret service agent\nNovelist Zoe sharp wrote the following narrative of the president's assassination I'm going to quote verbatim\nThe president didn't seem to notice heat wave in his ... the secret service agents clustered around him assured him forward neat armored limo idling outside at the curb the Russian waited until they were a few steps past before he drew the gun\nHe cited the um the center of the president's backing squeezed the trigger the MakerBot off this fired the secret service agent at the president showed her her neglect spawned the indoor crouch he registered the scene instantly drawing his own weapon with razor edge reflects is\nThe Russian tasted failures he closed his eyes he waited to pay the cost but it did not come he opened his eyes the secret service agents stood before him presenting his block\nBut first hear the agent said to the Russian assassin use mine in New York Times published this yesterday a secret service agent\nHelping a Russian agent assassinate Donald Trump after the Russians gun sales to fire\n\nNo wonder the New York times couldn't resist publishing ... even on a day when they are pretending to be horrified by the thought of violence because of some bombs being sent\nTo Democrats you know like a couple of mouse clicks could've told the writer of this\nPiece that the secret service no they don't use ... they're not issued blocks that use the six hour P to nine\n[noise] a minor minor [noise] so\nIt's actually ran in the New York times they explain the reason for publishing the piece the New York times that well\nOur focus here at the book review is our books and stories but also on how the books being written and ran reflect the world outside of books and one of the biggest stories out there of course is the mother investigation of the relationship between Trump and putting it's hard not speculative\nIt's made up their\nJustifying a story on the assassination of Trump by a secret service agent based on my mother investigation\nI'm telling you these people are not right folks they are they're ... they are suffering psychological disorders that has been brought on by the on the relenting hatred they feel over the outcome of the two thousand sixty and election\nThey are out of control and these are the same people that published and reviewed a movie on how to assassinate George W. Bush during his presidency\nAnd all day long yesterday and old days and I were getting\nPreached to bite of people in the media it would be very very dangerous discharge ... who was behind the bombs before we have the fact that is very very distant preaching to us\nAbout civility when they are running stories and publishing excerpts from books fantasizing over the thrill and the joy of Donald Trump being assassinated anybody find\nSomething seriously wrong with these people other than me\nThere's something seriously mentally psychologically wrong here I mean it's one thing to run this another thing to not realize how plain and simple wrong it is and then to justify it based on ...\nA little wrong it is and then to justify it based on the Mueller investigation\nWell there's a lot of interest out there Mr Limbaugh Muller is looking into the ties between ... and then Trump there aren't any ties between Hillary important there\nAren't any ties you haven't found any there never worry any that were known to be found there wasn't any collusion anybody with an open mind and like your pencil eraser knows it by now but not nice people\n\nHappiness glee over fiction\nResulting in the assassination of Donald Trump promoting it on the same day they're wringing their hands so ... did in ... so many bombs had been sent to Trump park anyway Trump is right on the money\nWith his tweet about the media being culpable and I'll tell you don't misunderstand you know I'm a big self responsibility person I Am so into it\nThat I don't ask for help enough folks I really don't I I've\nI've been told by number for you know you could really ease some stress if you ask for help I I I look at everything is isn't especially things I Want things I Need I look at them as totally my responsibility\nAnd maybe too much I don't know\nBut I firmly believe in it and so therefore whoever did this is the ultimate\nResponsible person no question about it but I'm not going to sit here\nAnd time my hands behind my back and the other half of my brain behind my back being preached to buy a bunch of people lying to us and being phony about it because they're not they are trying to pass responsibility if there's lots of Donald Trump and then trying to get us to shut up\nIn response and in opposition that we're supposed to sit here and said oh no no no until we know the facts and I can't comment while they comment left and right and start ragged on Trump\nOr his supporters or what have your while we're supposed to sit here and be polite to have good manners and not say anything about it\nWe're doing what we always do it we're minding our own business we got up one day and we find the left just trying to suck the hell out of the country and we find ourselves in the need to defend\nAnd it's happening again here Jim Acosta with a tweet\nTrump talked about the bombs center former public officials in his rally in Wisconsin but once again he didn't mention CNN on top of all that he criticized the media for coverage he doesn't like and of course he took no responsibility for his own rhetoric\nWell Donald Trump junior responded to cry baby Jimmy costume with Mr Twain hey Jenny did\nYou or your colleagues take any responsibility for your rhetoric in constantly calling my family racist and Nazis for two years when my wife actually opened and exploding envelope of white powder intended for me what about when it happened to my brother Jimmy\nYou know you guys claim everybody else has to accept responsibility for their rhetoric but you don't want to have any responsibility for your rhetoric or your action\nAnd that is so damn right on they demanded the media\nTotal exemption from what they say from what they report because they're journalists because they

much I'm Wilson my husband and I were talking last night and we came up with some really good common sense points you make that kind of illustrate\nWhy we think these packages weren't actually nail 'em ... their comments just questions and the first one to me is how likely is it that someone could mail multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd have them show up miraculously at the same time and across the valley yeah and if a day at Fox we vaccine that that's not that's not common sense I mean I still see how that can\nJust sort of the De Niro package didn't arrive until

shows up all of that same thought well how do you know it wasn't priority mail\nNo it couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller mentioned what I was going to one of the Congress else can they can in fact that there wasn't enough postage on it you know the post office he even accept it\nUm the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages so you're obviously not taking them again and paying for them you know having them weight and paid in profits properly\nUm your you have to stick the post office box right will post office box don't even have enough run with an oversized into\nThat doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get that but some of

just wanted to go up you know on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about was the government itself but individual also give more than any other nation and the point is is\nThat I have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right how my neighbor who they should give it to and that's actually what the government's doing they're telling our who they're going to get basically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give a choice\nAnd that's my point\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting

it happens to be true\nUh statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the way to look at these disparities is not simply say oh oh that could be me and in the run around feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining\nWell you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that era man\nAnd then having that impact the way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion in lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism never solves anything\n[noise] liberalism as a\n... choice because you'd never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you're

this I'm shocked that they don't say acne back me bomb on it pipe bombs are made from Steele\nWhy\nThe reason steel is used because the entire purpose of the bomb is to utilize the steel shrapnel went it explodes you put the explosive inside the pipe when it blows up the pipe breaks up and you have shards that terror people apart\nWell [noise]\n[noise] the attacker who\nThe press is saying it has a real level of sophistication [laughter] what world Vince attacker who I'm giving the code name Wylie coyote\nHas made his bomb out of plastic PVC pipe plastic so when it blows up it vapor rises the plastic it defeats the entire\nPurpose of a pipe bomb also read devices had protruding wires coming out of the PVC pipe with a big ridiculous looking digital timer tapes to it\nAgain this is not something you go on the Internet it never shows you to build a bomb this way\nAll the wires and the detonator usually concealed inside the pipe I don't know goes through an x-ray machine you see a big metal pipe probably is not gonna make it to whoever it is you're sending unless you're sending it to their home\nBut if you have a long pipe Blake thing and it shows wires and in the X ray you can see that there is a timer on the outside it's definitely not going anywhere\nWhere there was a level of sophistication levels sophistication\nBecause he had sent about ... or she by the way\nHe or she had a had sent 'em some of these bombs to home offices\nAnd and residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nGrilled tied to and something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and her fuzzy slippers with a cigarette\nHanging from the get the paper and the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they didn't have a Scranton ... both of them have private security course or stores

do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nScared of them who who are those people referring to write I mean I don't know all the address again like it was just the coverage and that was one of their they were saying that this was I guess Debbie Wasserman Schultz or the Senate\nAnd now she is I mean she's she's not even in Congress anymore right so ah but she they sent her to the office of that was sent back to her office they said was one that would maybe not have screening I don't I didn't I didn't fact check their claim\nBut that was what they were attempting to ah to pass office sophistication I\nI've never built a bomb no one don't intend to in my life um but it wouldn't\nYou say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because if you put a big metal pipe it's going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did it to\nGet past screening that's good but that shows that you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ or your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I I don't even know but it shows that you\nDo not understand why a pipe bomb is district\nBut the answer is no a plastic PVC pipe bomb it will ... it'll still be detected because and that's why he had the in my opinion that's why I had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equipment of alarm clock\nHad the in my opinion that's why I had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equivalent alarm clock tasted a stupid thing because like you you've seen like at the airport like sometimes you're like hey maybe I can slip in the bottle of water you know like ... you know like if there's no slipping this past the screening right like that ... that I think to the other to think that back this up\nOur one a ... you made it in in a way that was so none of them blew up right like yeah I think ten bombs around the country none of them explode right like so it seems to be that maybe you didn't want them to expose possibly the other part is why do you put a sticker with a mean on they're getting\nLess it's not going to explode if people are gonna be able to write and I want to get

you were blaming it on him\nWithout CNN is it's really irresponsible he was gone over ... they worked or target of this and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running a news organization ... he wrote\nA there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nAnd they had to I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence\nNo evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else fed into these bombings we have no idea\nWe have no idea who did them we have no idea what the motivation was it yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a political\nMotive but that's because the earlier political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it has such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who is mentally inefficient or\nIf somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marked that as somebody from the right\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at that in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by the hatred of Donald Trump there's obvious incentive to make America ill that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but they are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault you do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptical lie\nYou not to say that you know that that that if the if they say you're proving anything but you have to at least keep your mind open to the idea that there are not jobs on both sides with crazy motivation in a intense time\nLook what they did the freaking Kavanaugh people saying he was a gang rape is to stop it here's here's the amazing thing\nDo you remember at the time right after nine eleven for the first few years when something would be saying something would happen and we would hope\nThat it was somebody from the middle east remember that ... where we didn't want it to be an American no matter which side they were on we didn't want that to happen\nNow we just our dog piling on it for them it's them whichever them if you ... you know helps your political position it's them\nWe we don't even consider anything else we don't even consider that modern oh maybe the Russians are involved maybe this is just\nA an outside influence yeah probably not now but we're not even considering it we have zero evidence\nBut we're not even considering it we have zero evidence of anything\nAnd every one is the media is just condemning the right you have no evidence and I guarantee you if they find this guy\nAnd he is mentally disturbed and has no real understanding of anything that he is doing or he's left you will not hear that\nThey will change the narrative immediately to well it is kind of thing happens and it happens all the time and it could happen where it where it didn't go off and it could happen where it is a right wing extremist they'll just change the narrative it won't slow them down at all\nWhat did you think what was the part of this that's a that's a great getting your attention back\nWell first of all the fact that none of them have gone off yeah and\nThe list of the people involved too is pretty stereotypical way I wing target I have\nYou know jobs this bomber ... code name Wylie coyote [laughter] the only thing he didn't do is leave a plate of bird seed next to it and yeah I mean it's so obvious it's cartoonish to start with George Soros\nA and to include Robert De Niro and all\nOf the max in in ... scene waters all of the typical ... it just to me it's too much for they don't go off and it's that perfect list of the people that the right really doesn't like\nThat it's hard to live it is it's a cartoon list that is\nNow ... so it could ... don't don't get me wrong and I think you're probably saying this to it could be it could be a left or right wing for it could be a right wing person we have no idea if it is a right wing person they live in a cartoon world yeah they're ... they're ridiculous\nThey they they're so in that that they can make a ... they don't even understand why you wouldn't use plastic for a pipe bomb that that much to CNN's should grand when they said yesterday well shows the level of sophistication\nTacit ... here none of them went off and like there's no if you can't get one of the tend to go off what level of sophistication you have right low and it's so cartoonish there's no level of sophistication I I like this can you guys help me\nFigure out the needle CNN is attempting to thread here they write this is a from Brian filters newsletter dog she's most of the recipients were prominent Democrats or as a ... a Washington Post simply put it made incendiary rhetoric targets of Trump's words become targets of bombs\nThat's not the theme is blaming Trump weight like many people\nOn TV on Wednesday I specifically said I wasn't blaming Trump for the crimes of a madman shut news industry executives have repeatedly warned that Trump's reckless attacks against the media are having real world

who are very passionate about what they believe it I don't\nEven want you to honor the word ma call it the more and how dare you even say ... is a problem\nAnd it's not a problem if reckless that we're talking about a bombing reckless attacks against the media are having\nReal world consequences what are the real world consequences you're talking about\nAre on the day of law farms showing a light in the middle of a paragraph about the bombing and how harsh rhetoric can lead to bombings here saying you're not blaming him but you're also pointing out that his words have real world
