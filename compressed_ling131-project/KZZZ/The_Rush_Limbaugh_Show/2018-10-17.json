Hi\nThank you so much rush I'm just so no life man and if you're on fall Ballmer who shut up\nThat you won't ... well yeah and so you're you're demonstrating your your arrogant white privilege here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am a [laughter] really a a a oh with me to the uh the article from I Believe it was ... that are are that they're going to release the ball or a report or sometimes after the election we're ready to that yeah understand\nThat we don't believe that we're not going to believe anything Mohler those anyway\nNow that's an interesting point too\nI mean unless the unless he implicated or the or\nAn Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and the DNC\nA in a a this investigation including with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the [noise] uh\nI I just don't understand that the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not going to feel of people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump said I Want to understand it's\nLike a you know the magnificent seven uh both guys didn't you know when it came up there they didn't they didn't check into who they ...\nWhat kind of Christians were or or or uh you know if they are not lived a good life they wanted somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country of the last uh eight to a a sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um\nI haven't been very frustrated they haven't been able to do and if they could even with the icing on the cake but I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party that as a combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters so the the focus I think is on Jennings up a first time participation um\nAnd that's why this this enthusiasm thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger is so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger\nAnd they are exploiting it to generate turnout based on what they think is a majority of Americans don't hate Trump\nI I think they they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in\nPerusing the news as I Do more and more stories that are starving to raise red flags about the blue wave and there are some big\nBrush them ... during this on purpose they're sucking you when they're making you think you're given up they're making you think they're kind of just very you know trying to make you think you got it in the back no they're not going to ever\nPull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are when they have that much discipline to be able to have a media wide threw out the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have I'm willing to put that out there and I if I end up being wrong Soviet\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it\nBut it's this I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that\nYes I have never fought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHave been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in a way that outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they have been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand found that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judges Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda to some things he hasn't been able to do it like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think of all of these things are true people hate Trump regret their vote a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done they're universal opposition to it if\nThe Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Ross didn't fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nAre you a couple of with their their mentality that says winning is their birthright power is their birthright they're entitled but\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world starting to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary would have won in the first Trump would have never won in the first place yeah all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag in two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there were there wasn't any talk of Democrats not turning out back then
