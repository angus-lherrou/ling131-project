thoughts\nWork I Would sort of some Rush Limbaugh yesterday and what I noticed about his show is that he actually started with a half an hour about trade before getting into the capital of south and it made me feel like maybe some of the energy was gone\nI Am so happy somebody noticed that\nNow if you are listening yesterday you know why I did it because I told you why I did I told you why I opened with NAFTA and I'll repeat myself again we started out by pointing out\nTrump it down to thirty to forty five minute ceremony announcing NAFTA\nIn the rose garden any at all the people that have helped make it happen there and I\nPointed out that this is something that the press is gonna be their barren attendance but all they want to ask Trump about his Kavanaugh they're not asking

this beforehand get into the idea that there are accusations that Kevin all light in his hearing\nYeah and you know the New York times laid them out and ridiculous detail yeah and we should go through each one of them because I I Would like because there's an idea that if there is let's say he perjured himself which is one of the things a lot of people are starting to throw around now they're starting to say well perjured himself he lie\nIs a thing he was trying to paint himself in the best possible\nThey will she perjured himself that maybe he did I don't know I mean I haven't seen any perjury about sex doesn't matter we forgot about that yeah um but ... ...\n... if he perjured himself will give you perjured himself for me it's a problem yeah I I mean I got them to me it would it would matter on the context of it I guess I I mean if what do you mean like the ... thing like one of the things we're talking about it the the word ... which is a word I have not heard since probably Nineteen eighty five\nUm uh but he it was what does it mean and he said it meant flatulence and there's I mean I'm pretty sure\nOkay so this is a the Urban Dictionary right to abuse any list it's or illicit substance via insertion into one's rectum that the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard it you know Kate that\nBug funneling oh now\nI Know next nickel terms I don't

was on your blood falls on a national or not or okay okay so there's a there's the there's the the number one or ... or the next one is something that is whack\nDumb or F up\nUse to describe objects people or stuff you don't\nWant to do that like a you know that guy's a booth I feel like that's maybe also how I heard it now that you're saying it that way because it's just kinda like an insult yeah that may have been yeah right\nI just know I I remember the words but I don't remember and connected to you know sticking things in [laughter] anyway ah here's one that kind of makes me feel a little better a synonym for weed\nOkay yeah\nSo how would it is their sentences smelled use it in a sentence what his smell that booth [laughter] mountain I assume that da\nTease what you're saying yeah smells that boom yeah yeah yeah it makes me feel very uncomfortable sift the active lifting the uh the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over\nUh the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over rocks waves are waterfalls white\nUh in order to launch over hydraulics or rocks this entry sponsored by ... yeah 'cause that's what I've never heard that before I Move the low tones noise a dog make okay typically when they are suspicious or unsure of whether they should actually bark or not\nI haven't heard a flatulence one but I have heard many things related to the buck a which I think somewhat another term for having sex\nIt that'd be in the bud Bob [laughter] it's okay to again [laughter] I think this is the interesting point here they're trying to say that there's a centrally perjury\nThere's no way that's perjury to me that if they bunkers claim the idea that they're that word probably meant different things to different schools as as mine and yours did right as there are seven different definitions on Urban Dictionary for it now not just because flatulence didn't make it there does that mean that look locally that was not the way people used it but you do have the\nProblem of people in Georgetown Prep now starting to come out and saying look I I was for him and I don't think she did this for a good thing but now that he was saying that this is what these words mean come on man and and that he was never really fall down drunk yeah you're\nOkay what do you have that one ... do you want to go to that acts as a\nAgain the lists of potential perjury or from for judge Kavanaugh um the next one is excessive drinking just having a portrayed himself in his testimony is enjoying a beer or two in in high school and it's a college student but not as someone who often drink to excess during those years I drink beer with my friends on quote\nThen this is disputed as what they say and the times his statements our eyes at a uh with some of his classmates and how they remembered him nearly a dozen college classmates of judge Kavanaugh said they recalled a him indulging in heavy drinking some saying\nSo now it's not in less than a dozen 'cause some of them said I'm drinking some saying a it was a beyond normal consumption ... parents had to go here to be sure a smaller number of classmates that his drinking was unacceptable\nSo again this is like\nJudging yourself and how much you drink is notoriously difficult as I Would assume Mr alcoholic over here will be able to tell you\nA I mean the whole point is the toughest thing to do is admit you're an alcoholic right yeah it's very possible and I would say likely that most people who drink to excess in these periods would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal\nEven if they are here's what I here's how I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk and and he said\nLook we All right Dr ... drink\nTo excess we all did have you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing I don't consider this a problem because I I Believe that he was in effect saying yeah but there's a difference between a blackout mhm day and\nMaybe he had blackouts and didn't remember them I don't believe that at all you have a blackout you remember it you don't you don't remember what happened you remember the ... I remember you were like oh crap I don't even remember now maybe at Seventeen you know your local ... grew you ought to remember or\nMaybe you're Seventeen and doing that but you have to consume a lot of alcohol I I you know\nI got a man gay or ... expert witness and yet in a Glenn Beck please come to that sort of a\nYou know to me I don't I make a generalization but with a specific accusation Ninety five percent of people who say they drank to the point of blacking out or like\nI Believe it's Ninety five percent I Believe that blackouts do exist but it is extraordinarily rare I spend a week in France which I Can't believe by liberal returned with me out for sure it was going to be like you know what I'm staying on the beach here I\nDrink a lot of that and whether it's got to get back to dry out\nMy point though is that I had a lot to drink in my life you know certain times I've never even been remotely the mountains and other than alcohol\nThat you have to consume in a very short period of yeah I Know I've done I have I've done my homework on it\nUh and it's not exactly the way I have experienced it um apparently you can have blackouts if you drink a an enormous amount of alcohol if you if you were ...\nOr maybe um even if an enormous amount of alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly you can blackout\n... I I have read places where they say it's rare someplace to say it's common I'm Sorry but I Do not believe I Believe it's a movie trick that most people\nYou know they're like oh we do in one last night we uh six new right shut up\nOne last night we ah six no right\nShut up Ninety five percent of the Ninety five percent that's a lot I had a friend who had drank a lot in a very short period of time and blacked out a blackout fell off the stage and had to go to the hospital\nUm and that was a legit this was in college and that was a legitimate like he drank way too much nothing you didn't do anything wrong he just got off the agent was killed himself ... ... and and just remember being there but did not remember the falling or any okay\nUm and so I'm not saying it never happened but like the idea that you would say to someone oh why this guy's lying he did a blackout is completely absurd you can't you cannot you cannot accused him of lying about that only they wouldn't know if it occurred you can say that and this is what they are saying that he lied\nBecause he said you know he he gave the impression that uh he wasn't ever out of control falling down drunk well okay I don't believe that but I also don't I wasn't left with that impression\nNo he said I mean the quote busy I drank beer with my friends almost everyone did some times I had too many beers sometimes others that I like beer is still like beer but they're not drink beer to the point of blacking out he just said I didn't blackout in and say to drink to excess and back he said if I had to drink to excess\nAnd you know I mean I Am not a big drinker and my life but I drink to excess several times but never I mean the idea the base of black blackout drunk and you're a maybe a different story they blackout truck is\nI mean you've told me some of the levels of alcohol you've had in your life the levels are almost in human [laughter] like I Would\nDefinitely be dead they ... I mean you're dumping poison into your system of it your body can handle\nIt a blackout is shutting your body down ... saying I Can't keep you alive and to run all of these other systems right I mean that's that's you know that's intense so um\nWe have a couple of more of these and go through yeah if we need to but I mean I think you have to point this is the level of almost every one of these accusations\nSo I don't think they're not going to be saying I don't think that ... thing um what about the well let me take a break come back there's two things that could pose a problem\nFor him ... ... ... ... ... and some people are asking like why are you given up on cabinet I'm not not all I Know there's a fifty percent chance maybe hire that he gets through the issue here is if he doesn't I mean could have you have faith here you're having the non Kavanaugh\nCollins and Murkowski and flake if you have faith in them then fine don't worry about it but if you don't like I don't know then you better have planned be set up by the way I just want to make that really clear I'm not giving up on him at all\nI'm just playing this out scene where the Democrats are headed than we do and how will that affect those three senators\nBy July twenty Seventeen bitcoin was down forty percent taken tore came in and said Palm Beach in the Palm Beach letter a ... there's going to be some activity is going to bring enormous amounts of money into bitcoin\nWhat's bitcoin today a bitcoin currently sixty five forty sixty five forty eight bitcoin was trading around Eighteen fifty a coin at the time we all know that it went up to twenty thousand", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "02"}
