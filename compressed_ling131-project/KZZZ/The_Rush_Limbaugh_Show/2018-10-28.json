Peter teal Alan Garber from Harvard Bob ... and Jeff Bezos so\nThey're all meeting with him there are all meeting let's not pretend we don't know who this guy\nMeeting with him there Armenia let's not pretend we don't know who this guy is\nNow the guy who went missing\nHe's a reporter for the Washington Post\nIs he is he\nOr does he have a point of view that Washington happens to light up about a a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for\nBeing was to reject the west and establish global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool at harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism\nThey are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... to\nDo any administration a member from the Obama administration you cannot call them a largely secular organization when you read\nJust their motto Allah is our goal the profit our model the current our constitution jihad our plan and death for the sake of all of the ... of our wishes they're not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of calls jihad the industry of death\nAnd they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die noble e God gives proud life in this world\nOkay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nWhat the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy these were democracies so how are we going to do it well\nThe Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter the Arab Spring the Arab Spring praise by everyone we told you their goal is a\nCaliphate while it never materialized ...\nNo no not there yet materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim Brotherhood\nDid they just choose not to do a caliphate\nOh no no they were overthrown oh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both Jay chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism\nAs a as a means to there and was\nSo shocked to hear his show or whatever you're calling him today\nNow where you look at him he\nIs he is a guy who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood I Want to say this no one deserves this kind of death this is not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all the Saudi progressive fighting for democracy\nNo no no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth heading editing out all thought crime\nMakes sure that there was never anything hostile said about ... or the king\nDuring this time he cozy up to us I'm a bin Laden he scored several interviews well oh Titus was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be the middleman between bin Laden and the Saudi royal family will in two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals\nWhen he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobby is movement\nA an article critical to the ... hobbyist\nLoop and why did he do that\n... because he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the hobby is\nThe shah geared to show he was cast aside and that's when the western media fell in love with him\nAn active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring\nHe got out he came to the U.S he established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressive the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy like turning it against itself\nHe wants wanted to establish sure Rio law in the region\n\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh Israel's outside the context of history and logic so we're going to have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that\nWhy is that a smear campaign to say that he\nWas a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what\nThis man wrote this man wrote that he ... it was a mistake to think\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islamic says\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam Islamic ... believes you have to use sharia law\n... the constant wow it sounds like the Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law should Rio law\nSo let's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood turkey would\nLike to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states [noise] true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "28"}
