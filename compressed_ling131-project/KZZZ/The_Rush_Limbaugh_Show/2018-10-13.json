fan\nYeah it isn't saying I've never heard three thousand dollar impound fees that's kind of crazy okay it's from a collection agency do you have proof that you sold the bike\nI'm either the term her title and forgot\nI understand but you didn't you don't have proof you just did it so as far as as far as they're concerned you never transfer title\n[noise] [laughter] okay so here you are never transferring title and uh\nNow who would collection agency whose charging you for the impound fees\nAnd it was a ...\nAlright it was a way it was it the city or a private company\nA hit man I got a ticket and then that led to a helicopter to come out and\nThey're All right so charming company and they won three thousand dollars\nA gallon of I let him keep the bike and just say a fine you know go ahead and keep it if they go after you uh you say I sold the bike years ago and the problem is they're going to ask what the proof is why I ask you for paperwork and sales\nI either or a sales ah receipts I mean my daughter had a a very old car or that she gave to a friend of hers\nAnd and and she made sure that it was ... she has the copy that his registered how you were going to say what\nThey auction off the bike and someone else bought it registered with recovered after ...\nYeah because they impounded it so you say no because you sold the bike and argue and I don't understand the three thousand dollars but a a mark your defenses are are attacking the three thousand dollar impound me and somehow proving that you sold a biker gave it to your body\nAnd that's all you can do and maybe your buddy will testify saying yeah ah he sold the bike to me uh and I saw him registering at ... I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have to have to prove not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just it's just too easy to uh attack you on this one so are you defeat you obviously you tell a collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them to to you and then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims to probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous ... even a disputed has your credit already been attacked not yeah\nAll right it probably will our credit yeah probably will you gotta mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWell my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand was just negotiate with them negotiate say I'll give you half the money now\nI have and by the ah the thing is I I mean it the money more than anybody I'd rather get the money that's\nRight well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them and go pounds sand or you look at your credit you've got your choices none of them very good unfortunately are not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a ... everybody looks to the law as an\nThis is a ... everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example which which cleaned about the ... have you committed a crime yes or no right it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determined here's the statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law un thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated gee that's clean stuff I Will you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud and I want a restraining order what does that\nMean what is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the CIA answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not\nMe there you go silver lining every moment\nHello paying hello paying your up taking my call ...\nI I Would say that part of like ... for a lot how to read this article ... like white\n[noise] or um so I look at their wetland Africa so they don't want to go now you're a pay for it you got to pick it back and forth so I went up by ... or ...\nOr [noise] the reason for my ballot with because recording I thought it\nWas it well you're you're talking about your license plate was stolen\nThat girl thicker Hervey went up the you you you say it was stolen [noise] well I didn't know was selling so how how do you know so and then\nOnce I got a ticket that's when I figured out while and they have to do it\nIt may have been so it may have been stolen how 'bout you just didn't put the sticker on\n[noise] [noise] no I I put a thick on on my car\nOkay so so when you got a ticket for not having your sticker on the license plate a big ticketed you for not having your sticker on your license plate even though you put it on you say\nYes I have this dollar which I wasn't aware\nOf what was so and I don't understand that the sticker was stolen from whom by whom\nThicker madness do it from the license plate\nOh why oh why wait on took the sticker off your license plate\nOr iron play play yeah\nOkay got it and that was confusing as hell think are claiming that one out for me oh God limit the time ... time okay and the court just didn't believe it because you didn't put a police report\nRight yeah it's okay with it of course I didn't I wasn't I didn't want to do it right and now what what's your question\nAlso also and different to their response was that they took a picture of the like a play on a ... they said that while she would have taken not afraid of credit\nBack alright what's your so what's your question my question is should poll forget about yeah but I yeah I mean what how much is a ticket I think it's an older couple of dollars\nAre going to be alone when I hear you you go to court I Would just pay it but here you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge you go your honor here's what happened a\nB C and D and uh they said we should have\nFiled the police report who helped ... police report over a stolen sticker on a license plate because once I put the sticker on a license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nBecause I think micro check it every day\nYeah exactly I think it and I think ... D for these in defense a shirt tell her to a judge because words that happens you have to pay for the ticket anyway yeah or\nI mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane\nDefenses you've ever seen and the and the fun one where ah the people come up and they said you'll see with an explanation\nAs if the judge chairs you're they're guilty or you're not so whenever you see someone guilty with an explanation depending on the judge or if the judge allows the person to explain just to get it off his or her chest ... you'll see the judges\nDavid Hi David [noise] yeah okay\nYeah so uh [noise] I'm a software developer and uh I developed some software for a seat in the studios\nThat actually was a young wrestle show [noise] and uh [laughter] we could I just want to know if I had the case against that basically my cousin which I Do not have a contract with a is the one that\nYou know or that if the deal and a contract is between\nThat is the deal and a contract is between young when the ref for and my cousins company and I developed a software and so we should receive licensing fees every year okay uh for the software\nAnd uh for four or five years I was receiving my payment\nAnd then a one year last year somewhere around October when we get a month [laughter] I didn't get my payment and eye contact my cousin and I said hey you know what's going on a payment\nBig long story short basically what I found out was he went to his friend and they were trying to rewrite the software copy my code basically and give a CBS a new version of the software and then they should cut me out of the deal\nNow how much money were you getting a year\nOr a thirty grand with the leasing and my cousin gave me twelve and he'd keep\nUh uh actually I got eleven like eleven thousand eight hundred different so how did it work that he got more money than you how did they did in\nThe okay there's no good reason for him to get more money than you you were just in the contract because\nOf that now now in those four years I just want you know I was the one that ... they always contacted support for the summer I Would go and do the crying\nOkay so here's and so the bottom line you get to see who your cousin and your customers defense is going to be hot gee we don't have any signed contracts your argument is going to be yeah but then why do we don't have a signed contract why did you pay me a over four years but what if\nWhat if I don't want us to my cousin and what if I Do like I spoke with the DEA is one of the restaurant next plane than situation unfortunately they're caught in the middle but I told them I owned the copyright that software\nOkay so you're right and right now you're you're infringing on those cocktail\nActually not because there was a contract or that they have been inspired CBS to screw you is your cousin that's screwing you and I want to have the written contract and you're saying there is a written contracts between your cousin and CBS correct\nYes and yet but in that\nContract goes nowhere there is no car there's nothing that states I'm releasing my copy right\nYou have ... but the point is that you're allowing him to use it it's not a question releasing the copyright it's a question of we have a deal you can go ahead and use it a verbal deal you go ahead and use it so what do you want to do if you can't sue the ... what would you like\n[noise] I Want what I Want to have you stop using the software\nI I don't know if you can start you can stop it now you can make a motion to have CBS and then there was a lawsuit about interference with a contract that they may have but I tell you you go in to see a CBS you've gotta you've got a world of hurt and what are you gonna do you're ... you're going to send them in the seats and saying you can't use the software anymore\nBecause uh I'm being ripped off and they're going to say we're not ripping you off you talk to your cousin what I don't want us to my cousin well that's true yeah yeah okay\nYeah basically basically it's\nLike why wouldn't you want to sue your cousin who's coming you ... because\nIt's good because it's going to cause more family problems I Believe you know uh [noise]\nI don't know if you're you are an idiot across several different levels I was going to cause a family problems if someone's stealing or stealing from me and I want to go after the wrong word but I Can't because it's going to cost family problems so they're going to get

turning off and on and on and turning it off and turn it on their limiting the amount of people\nThat are I mean you've seen the ... has been an aging status say I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though when you start looking at the eye of that storm and where it hit\nHow close it had it could have had to like a major metropolitan area and it wasn't just\nTwenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this is a huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives near Panama City\nIn how's he doing right okay\nOr his house survived good now but we're all you know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you tell him to evacuate only two days before hand and he did in the morning of the hurricane yeah Russian government aren't we yes um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about that so so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time that you pull into your driveway\nYou're getting your stepson is make sure you're wearing your ... [laughter] because you're going up and up and down a bath is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there Beth tie can so do you have Internet access has everything good by you know\nWe did not have Internet we have spotty cell service\nOff All right so without the Internet what do you miss the most\nOh my gosh I'm probably social media\nFacebook I heard Facebook in the background of\nFake my daughter and my husband are here with me there and it got so um yeah I I went to make a dinner for the last night and I thought that the rest of it away I Can't look it up [laughter]\nSorry Karen ... Mac and cheese again cause I can read the Bible [laughter] okay\nSorry Karen I have a Mac and cheese again because I can read the ... this was a show like All right and then on the grill it that's really interesting well you know that it's healthy right are you all kind of kind of died out the window [laughter]\nAll I did was it was like I'm not the nervous like\nShe says that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know and make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nOff the coast um [noise] so I understand you have a question about the smart a speaker is once you get the power and once you get your Internet back [laughter]\nRight yeah I mean a lot about you know everybody is saying that everyone should and I'm like do I really need one ... ...\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets and initially when you get you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic is going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and they start moving up the actual long so then you say on the line\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock the lights will go into a night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next to your table some white noise is playing just to to use\nIt all happen automatically\nKnow of course not you know that [laughter] if they like you to see that but you have to you have to buy all the gadgets along the way right\nAre you going to buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program it\nOr they were thermostats that like the ego be in the nest that work with the Amazon Echo so that this way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get your lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up to sixty six or whatever it may be\nAnd so it takes a while for you to get in doctrine aided into it so to speak\nOr no pun intended with the smart speakers but once you once you get it I think that you'll understand like this is exactly how it's close to where I'm going to put together some links for you over a commando dot com and so that this way you can\nSelect has the right Amazon Echo and also we have a couple of articles about some gadgets like I just mentioned that you might want to tie into the [noise] Alexa environment and thanks for the update on what's going on with you and your family are so pleased to you know everybody's came through with a just a few more pounds [laughter]\nAnd that's the extent of what happened with the with hurricane Michael again thank you for your call\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps in your legs and feed well to the Iranians complete relief do what I Do and use their own works relieve\nFast acting phones gifts there were released today and the pain relief I like your local pharmacy or get it on line as there are worse relief dot com once again that there are worse relief dot com\nComing up we got Facebook and our digital life ... if you don't want 'em or [noise]\nOr even more everything digital cameras on them [noise]\nWhen you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through thousands of irrelevant resumes you want in a way to get to a shortlist of qualified candidate you need it the dot com job admit it set up screener questions based on your job requirement\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks but she can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go to your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile\nPassport you heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else you get that out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back okay there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right and they're\nAll coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nOr a border patrol now if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line\nSixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to give\nAnd sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like three minutes oh my gosh I have to have that you have to do it is you have to do it\nAnd so and it's like one of these things like before everybody knew how to get pre check you know it was good to get free check but [laughter] but now everybody has pre check [laughter] so it's kind of like that same thing with this mobile passport and so when you get off the plane and ah when you land back in the states just look for a sign that says mobile passport here in Phoenix\nUh they actually didn't have a site and I had to ask one of the border patrol agents like you know where's the mole passport and he's like oh that way you go I mean I went all the way to the left and when I got on the line there was one person in front of me so again mobile passport great at ah for anybody that's doing any type of international travel\n[noise] All right

simple as driving to the grocery store taking it off the shelf\nBut you might not think about that there's this vast and complex chain of moving parts that have to work together to get your food on the shelf and it's growing increasingly more fragile\nI mean hurricanes a perfect example of how single disaster can tip the fragile balance and lead to food insecure that can last for weeks and

feeds their given and bits per second higher numbers are better okay and download speeds there's typically going to be much much faster than up ...\nAnd you want to compare these numbers that you get
