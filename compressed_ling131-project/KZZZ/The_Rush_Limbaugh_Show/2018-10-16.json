the leftist I'm sick of this but I think the average Democrat is just sick of this as as the or the rebel a Republican and independent is\nI mean you know it starts with shouts your abortion jobs here abortion nobody wants to shout their abortion nobody thinks that's a good idea except for the extremist and the and the revolutionaries and the Marxist and you know the the post modernist everybody else's like don't shout your abortion that's not something to be proud of\nSo you you have this you have asked to or you have you know Haiti he cops hating white hating men hating capitalism shutting

she's just\nMaking at about identity politics more and more and nobody cares you know people are done with identity politics I'm telling you they're done with it\nAnd the the the first candidate and well we already know the first candidate was Donald Trump that said I don't care I don't care I don't care what you say about me I don't care what she accused me of I don't care that's why he won\nBecause he that's white twenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump and you'll never hear this from mainstream media because they don't they don't the Democrats don't want this known\nTwenty percent of the people who voted for Donald Trump voted for Barack Obama at least once many twice\nSo they came over from the Democratic side\nThey're sick of it they're sick of it\nNow they may not like is extreme tweets and everything else\nBut they definitely don't like the idea that yeah we're going to get rid of capitalism goes it's an old outdated idea yeah you know we think we should shut down free speech oh I hate those cops they're all murderers\nMan boy man or trouble especially white man did you know that I'm Indian and uh that's a really great I shouldn't have said India and it really should be Native American because then you\nShow up nobody cares with\nAll of this stuff that is going on in the world\nShut up the issue here is\nYou don't win that twenty twenty

over early which is why they're all coming out and that's why the Spartacus moment happened is white Kamala Harris was so crazy during the cabinet and saying why ... on TV with you know with the crazy a crazy stunts every day\nBut she does do how do you see what it used to happen is you'd have to you'd have to go over to the extreme and then you'd moderate\nYou're not going to be able to moderate but those people how do you moderate\nHow do you go over to the side of adds up on and say hey I don't think anything is wrong with that ... shouts your abortion and then when you get the nomination\nCome back close enough to the center to where people are going oh she didn't really mean the shell the abortion thing oh she didn't really mean ... cars and so far in the show your abortion people are not going to let you get away with it\nWith their self confidence issues I I have a lot of self hatred that came from committing the crime and are coming out of that I was drunk or every day for about seven years you know and I held my life together I I Would sober up to go to work\nI Would come home and just get tanked and start all over again and then I'm back in ... years two thousand eight I had a terrible accident I was drunk again uh messing around with fireworks\nWho are from Wyoming and lost a fifty percent of my left hand oh my gosh\nAnd I didn't know her up\nI I soak it up for four years and I got married uh uh uh took on three step kids and walked into a different life rebuilt my relationship with God and I came to a point of stress says comes in marriage

his isolating myself from my family and my office\nA sleeping in my office and that are really hampered my relationship with my wife and my kids and uh you know so by the time I saw this interview between you and Dan I'm I was at my own rock bottom you know I was Iraq but I was keeping my life together\nAnd I was very honest with my wife about my problems with uh my parents you know and raise the last you know step back into the family company when I take it over\nI Know that that life is for me and I'm you know I'm\nI've like I said I followed politics since I was a kid and really one of

McGuire um go to my pod cast and listen to gene McGuire he was wrongly accused spent thirty four years in jail in prison um and ah his attitude\nA and his story of redemption and also a sobriety is remarkable\nUm and then also you might find it useful I did an interview with Louis house or from the school of greatness a few weeks ago a and that kind of goes into things are a little more I was operating on about three hours sleep\nWhen I did that interview and I listen to it and I went oh dear God what am I doing [laughter] ah so there is it is very Frank on that one or you might want to or you might want to listen to those demean one more favor\nYou have your wife called me if\nYou fall off the wagon just to just for a little just intense and when we can we can we can chat on the air and then you know maybe that would provide a little incentive for you\nFor you not to my wife my wife told me if I ever drink she'll leave me and I believe her\nA and that that that does cross my mind I Believe even if you don't start drinking she may yeah yeah she is she's getting up to the point now where she's like I'm going to start drinking or I'm going to be [laughter] ah but ah but best of luck\nTo you will when you least expect it expected a if you just remember that that your mind will knows you better than than you think and it will play all kinds of games with you you will make it when you least expect it expected I've made a book\nA out to you and we're going to put it into a into the mail for you thank you so much great thank you Glenn pretty she added\n... ... ... I you know I Want to spend some time maybe on tomorrow's show I Want to spend some time about this I'm getting so much a ... ... e\nMail now on people who are trying to go through recovery but more importantly I'm getting a lot of mail about depression\nAnd I'm a and suicide yeah and I don't know why\nThis is happening but suicide is a huge spike and I don't think people understand it a and I want to share some of the things that I have seen in the mail and some of the things that I've heard I don't know if you saw\nA star is born I did not know Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga yeah he has to be a an Oscar contender all I think they're both gonna win Oscars\nThey should it's it's it's fantastic um but it is um\nI don't want to own record anything but uh it um it deals with alcoholism uh and and suicide and it's a it's a very powerful and his portrayal of that\nAnd um\nHer no suicide is in our is in the ... right now\nInside is in our is in ...\nRight now um and uh\nSo we'll we'll talk about it possibly tomorrow you mentioned you signed a book or for a for him and the book of course I've been to the outrage we talked about about twenty five million times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores however we want one thing we don't mention often is subtitled\nAnd you know\nIt's about how treating the country right ... ... and then meeting that we have a problem not like us but like the country as as as a whole as a whole has an issue with the way they're dealing with problems\nUm and if you if you look at that because it's about what you don't have it in front of me so yeah it's a um a house thinking like a recovering addict can help you heal the country yeah I mean if it's if those principles that are helping him get through that alcoholism right\n... ... a lot of the same principle would work at a on our country no they definitely would and that's you know you get into some of the ... addiction issues in the book but also how that applies to everything we have to deal with a ... ... even with a cure for Michael I have an ... like this is it that's what the book is about\nRight it's about being able to apply apply those and they weren't supposed to be the other situation\nIt starts at the ... and it starts at the beginning it's not just admitting you have a problem that we all have a problem that the nation has a problem and I think we can all admit that\nUm but it really it released\nIt it's just got a I think there's a section in here that in the book that really came before as an alcoholic I had to decide is life worth living\nAnd\nIn the book there's a chapter of are we good or are we bad is this republic is the American experiment\nWorth saving\nAnd we're not talking about that we're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that question\nAnd the book goes through that and I I think the road to recovery of of our ills in this nation start there\nYou know you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in\nWhat what is that you believe in and and really believe in don't tell me to try little things telling me about America tell me who you are now she can't do that because I don't I I just don't think that she's\nA she's honest enough to tell me she's she's a politician seats of calculating and and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we not talk about politics for a second\nIs America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place\nAnd the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad because both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah all the good things red white and blue and were\nPatriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country\nWe have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad\nTo be a little better than I was yesterday and if I let myself go I'll be a bad guy well we've let ourselves go we're not trying to balance that anymore", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "16"}
