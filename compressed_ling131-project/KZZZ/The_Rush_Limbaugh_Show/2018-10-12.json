Hillary's emails the best investigators but nosy as people and nobody can Trump\nDidn't believe nobody could find them Trump believes everybody was shielding them and protecting Hillary so he's had hey Russia maybe you can find them none of our people seem to know where they are maybe you could Hillary is still walk by this\nYou asked Russia hacked me on national TV she went to Twitter to make that point and Trump did no such thing if anybody would even the slightest sense of humor would realize\nHe was making a blindingly obvious when\nHe said the news media would reward Russia for finding Hillary's emails before Trump quote is Russia if you're listening I Hope you're able to find the thirty thousand emails that are missing I think you'll probably be rewarded mightily by our press he

hypocrisy is ineffective I'm Talking about only in terms of persuasion and if it ever does work\nTo persuade we're probably will never know it\nOne thing I've found throughout my life is when you're when you're targeting people to persuade them egos are such that they never want to admit that anybody change their mind they want to say they came to these conclusions themselves\nThey haven't gotten over the fact that Trump won they can't get over the fact that they're people can't get rid of the Trump the intelligence\nAgencies the FBI that the OJ the deep state powerful people\nIn Washington

memory is correct when he first moved to New York did you not lose your luggage or your ... your furniture never arrived\nWithout engine that did that did the moving trucks that had all of my worst league good jak got parked in the trucks that but it took something Indiana the driver quit [laughter]\nAnd how he got driver got mad at a company and I didn't have I didn't have luggage or for the first month after I got the furniture nothing had no early positions other than my briefcase\nAnd the clothes that was worked for for a month yeah you're right that was the one of the first elements of the uh debuting at the front of your your memory is really good to remember that\nWell thank you [laughter] I'm calling I wanted to talk about what's left is doing with their intolerance and how that relates to the Saudi journalist ...\nOh yeah but I first mentioned just ironically given what you less about I happened to be a clinical psychologist in private practice and I am not soon\nYou know people coming into the office falling apart because of Trump\nIt's just not really happening sometimes it gets mentioned in passing but but um it's not really happening and when people mention anything that triggers a stress response\nIt really isn't the the stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to deal with stress because they could they could have problems in any issue money or relationships or something else it's really help you get the get stronger to be\nA to build some palaces and to not catch them so Chris soon to be a little more open minded\nI'm ... I'm not seeing with with some of those people are saying\nWell now wait a minute now are you suggesting that the story is in the political that's the equivalent\nOf something as big in ... Washington Post suggesting that the story is exaggerated and not that many people are suffering from this ah trumped arrangement syndrome or whatever\nI can tell you that I have an extremely busy practice and it's not happening does Trump get mentioned in passing yes so didn't George Bush so they will go rock Obama but usually they were not there never\nYeah but what if your office was on the Upper West side or one of your office was in Georgetown or you know in Hollywood I won't share boulevard what it was ... falls is not I mean you've got basically when Jimmy Stewart's up that right\n[laughter] well I'm sixty miles from New York City so it's not too bad\nWell that's that's far enough away I mean that's the way the often just falls not Manhattan for a reason\n[noise] well if someone came to me and they were really really upset about Trump my goal will be to try to help them manage that so they don't say don't fall apart because Trump is not the issue the issue is rarely the trigger unless it's unless it's\nA sheet your being responsible I think the psychiatrist these people are going to see are suffering from the same things I don't think many shrinks know how to help them\nI think the drinks are probably encouraging them that they're justified in feeling this way that Trump is enough of a rubber ... they make anybody feel this way and that's normal\nI can tell you one thing that I'm I'm right of center and I'm In the minority in psychological and psychiatric field\nOh yeah Oh absolutely\nSo that that that bias does bring in someone who's very much a progressive or liberal [noise] um they will certainly be affected by what's going\nOn okay let me ask you this I'm a you may not be able to\nTell me this because of a a patient client a confidentiality I'm not asking the names but what what percentage of the people who are coming to see you for help are in fact out of kilter because\nOf politics not maybe Trump per se or any of\nThe politics not maybe Trump per se or any other personality but just politics in general how many of them are in a state of confusion or stress just because of policy\nThat says zero percent zero percent yeah zero percent that centers yeah\nThey're not coming in with for that as the they have other things to do they're worried about you know their families are they're going through a divorce or they have anxiety or depression about other things or they were traumatized [noise] um\nLet's see two liberals all of that is Trump spoiled [laughter] because he got elected and he's president it's all his fault\n[noise] that you know it's it's interesting one of the things that helped me you're right was psychology when I was running it because um when people come into my office so they have terrible child [noise]\nAnd and maybe it's legit they were really mistreat it they were view I can sympathize with an enterprise and you say that was horrible now we have to do the work of getting past it and continue to blend or doesn't help\nAnd having the attitude that somebody else must change in order for me to feel better is backwards we have to be willing\nTo thank you you have just defined liberal

how you're going to power this Jack how are you ... if there isn't going to be any kerosene refine which is jet fuel jet a if you're not going to have enough jet fuel for anybody who by this plane to fly it why are you going to make it\nSo well what you're hearing isn't true\nWe routinely study the fuel markets ... you're right Mr little boys you always are there was no way that we will design introduced manufacture a brand new jet\nIf there isn't going to be ample supply is a fuel for it\nAnd he said by the way we're not the only people who make jets there continue to make new ones everybody I Know in the ... business sub the gulfstream CEO is designing and building new ones in fact Mr Limbaugh you can look around we'll find some people actually trying to redesign supersonic travel\nInto Concord ride I sort of how can any of us\nSupersonic travel that's Concord ride I sort of how can this be if we're hearing that there's a finite supply of fossil fuel and it you're not going to get enough for anybody to be able to fuel one of these planes flying anywhere he's about to simply isn't true\nSo I once you get realized listen to the people who are making financial investments\nIn their products and their businesses designed to grow the business and sell them why would they start making new airplanes if there isn't going to be any fuel why would they build a brand new big mall if it's going to be underwater in five years\nWell you have to do is look at real life look at people at what they're investing in where they are investing in it and you know the future you'll at least know where the smart money thinks\nWe're headed in the future as much as anybody can do it but I'm just here to tell ya that old Jim here on Jupiter is right there is no way on earth you build the biggest mall in the state of Florida or in many other states in a place that you think's going to be underwater or that Al Gore thinks is going to be underwater\nDoes that change with Al Gore said no no no in fact in Hawaii they have these things periodically called king tide and when king tides hit in Honolulu in a while ago you can have streets in Waikiki temporarily flooded\nWhen those things happen in the king tides of happening for young when king tide time that's when ... goes on TV so see she climate change rising sea levels free crush her on a low low soon\nTo be underwater it's just a king tide happens regularly it goes out it comes and it goes away they just lie to people folks they simply lie and make it up making money making money all the way\nRussia was simply really tell me ER be worse\nIf you suffer from E.
