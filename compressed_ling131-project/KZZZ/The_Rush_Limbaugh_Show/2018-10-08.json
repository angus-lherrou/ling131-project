you know I think that the\nSenators knew they weren't going to get the votes of the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um do you think that\nIt is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he\nCould have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the foreign that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons\nAnd a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nBecause that's what men do be cause man can\nAnd men can because they have the genitalia necessary to do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign onto that well you don't\n\nAnd so now these leftist women aren't enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade\nA bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kevin Ball\nSo now these women are sellouts and their ... says are sellouts and their rooms are cello and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become worthless\nAnd even the liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts engender study saying\nDo we need white women\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand eleven the Obama presidential campaign this

to put together a winning coalition of us sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working class voters were becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nIt's rational ... this is simply an evolution of that\nSo while the white working class was totally go pounds than by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen\nDo we

much more conservative Supreme Court for the next generation abortion rights gay rights climate change in health care reform could well be impacted for decades to come\nWe've been told per week this

need another conservative and all the things that you think are a big deal would be violated in the same way\nYou they went to the sexual assault allegation they went to a gang rape allegation\nThey ... and and what happened ... I think you can certainly speculate completely fabricated gang rape allegations against demand because they wanted to stop the the conservative position on abortion rights gay rights climate change of health care reform\nAnd as soon as it is over this is not about assault anymore and if it was about a salt you would say well look we would accept all of the conservative things that this guy's going to do because Trump won the election and we understand that but this one individual shouldn't go to the Supreme Court is that what it's about\nThe college fix managed to contact one student on the

but is that really what we care about\nWhat about the poor accuser\nHe said uh the allegation stems from a night which he and his accuser both were pretty drunk after which he performs\nAll at my school literally everything all of our Facebook messages are Snapchat messages she saved all of them text messages and even my ready to count and I was deemed to be so not a threat to her that the investigator didn't even care if I was in the same class with her\nThat didn't stop make them scared putting his name on the rapist list\nAsk if the school was aware of the ... website was run by students at the University of Washington\nThe officials said we don't know for certain aspects of false allegations on the site made or posted by students or affiliates of the university would be treated as harassment under school policy\nThe school said if the ... university receives a complaint that an individual was being harassed or bullied by a student we would investigated in the same manner as we would any other case so being lifted on a website as a rapist\nIsn't being bullied\nIn an interview with the student newspaper the daily you W University of Washington law school associate professor said that the website moderators could face considerable risk of defamation lawsuits by anyone's name they mention in connection with the criminal behavior or sexual assault that gives rise to civil liability\nPersonally this is why I Believe anyone\nWho falsely accused and I do not necessarily include Ford I don't believe there's enough evidence to say that he did it but I also don't think there's enough evidence\nThat she wasn't telling of is saying an event that she thought Brett Kavanaugh was involved in however the gang rape and\nThe boating uh it'd be a boating weekends from hell those people should be investigated\n... probably primarily the person who made an accusation and then later recanted on Twitter um you know here's someone who actually admitted that they were lying about it uh and I mean shes you face repercussions for that I think he has an energy asked you should gimmick false allegations like the earlier deal in our society\nOr the uh the moderators of the site said we hope that anyone whose name was in accurately posted on our side will let us know so we can remedy the situation that's when I said we've verified each claim to the best of our ability but we haven't published any claims that we believed to be false\nDid you reach out to the accused is\nThis some sort of a a non jury trial what what what what is this the inquisition you're accused your name is out\nThe sights domain name was registered November twenty nine twenty Seventeen with additional security to protect the individual or individuals that registered at\nI mean look at the long state I mean they're gonna get themselves sued obviously or something I Hope so and I should I Hope so I think it's a long standing repercussions of this Clarence Thomas went through a very public accusations of sexual harassment the end of at the end of that story if we don't you know remember it's been a long time\nBut they went through all of that stuff to see if they thought he was guilty of sexual harassment and people agree that he was not guilty of sexual harassment or they wouldn't put them on the court to the point of eleven Democrats eleven Democrats voted for Clarence Thomas's confirmation\nEleven that sound like even possible today even if you had God\nAs you've actually got would almost get zero votes from the dark as as you put that up but they're you know you've got the equivalent of God on earth would not get eleven votes from Democrats today I feel it's sort of for a friend of a friend that was on the Duke lacrosse team at the time of the Duke lacrosse a incident\nHe was not at the party\nBut he was on the Duke lacrosse team for years after that had been debunked\nHe still had trouble with that in interviews for getting jobs he couldn't get jobs because he was on the Duke lacrosse team which really should only be known for being a really good lacrosse team other than the fact that they got a bunch of false allegations against them which were proven to be false\nThese things stick with you for years they ruin your reputation for ever\nAnd you know this is not minor posting on verified things like this should not be the way our society goes there and yet there have been issues this is the problem I mean you've got to talk about with the with like sort of pendulum theory before Glenn was swings back one way and swings back the other even further\nUm you know there are a lot of things that we've seen that have come out of this I think everyone in the in the audience would agree are are positive\nRight like people like you know Harvey Weinstein right with tons and tons and tons of evidence going down or at least having he still has not been charged you should be um but the idea\nLeast having he still has not been charged and should be um but the idea that some women actually did go and then one of the reasons we know about Harvey whites than we can really all kind of come together and say yeah he was\nActually doing these things is because a couple of women went to authorities and got him on tape doing it yeah we have the authority which the authorities\nAnd that is why it's a lot easier to feel good about a saying Harvey Weinstein is guilty\nThen it is about a Brett Kavanaugh because you know having all there is no evidence like that at all\nSo I Want to give you um I Want to give you a
