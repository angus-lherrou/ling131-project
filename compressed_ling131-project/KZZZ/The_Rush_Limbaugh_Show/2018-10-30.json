some facts on the ground forty ... oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is it just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all this is exactly why Trump was elected\nAs my good friend McCarthy any recording said you've got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the leftist beside itself the day the NBC is headlined Trump\nConflict tack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP based everybody's a he can't do that that sort of fourteenth amendment he can't universally\nWith an executive order reversed the pork either maybe what we want to discuss how maybe he can he's going to run into activist judges that will that will turn him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump digital the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended to grant citizenship\nTo slaves and their descendants\nHowdy howdy\nAnd\nSo this is something that's long been fought to be untouchable Trump is saying I look I think I can fix this one of the executive order\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events\nUrge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue way were designed to create this massive voter\nIntensity and turn out by Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\nFrom the conclusion isn't there has been no blue wave there's not even been a blue ripple back you might even say there hasn't been the blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal cities so this guy is off the\nFirm belief that a conservative red wave or Republican red wave is coming and is on the way\nMany other people are I I've heard some people that were rush look if you got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements that's that's [noise] that's ... ... don't\nKnow how to factor all of that that's more\nRetirements than a single year than we're ever used to having to factor in\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been or has been lost I think by the way the\nPolitical professionals are going to be\nHyping the fact that as things stand I just probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places things stand now looks like the Democrats might when the house by two maybe for\nThe and that's going to be designed to get you to not get lazy and overconfidence don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nEvidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by maybe because their efforts to derail Trump have failed\nEvery one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly ... loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered to go with\nThe special counsel buying now all was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope\nFor the special counsel investigation\nBarring an actual report they had been hoping and praying for\nA week [noise] that would be\nIndicative that the report does say that Mahler found hard\nEvidence that Trump important she didn't and stole the election from the clutches of the hill the beach but there aren't even on the sexual weeks\nThat's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this\nBy now Mueller was supposed to have delivered the guards the drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off the plan B and plans and see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident in

because they were just fed up\nThat Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican\nParty and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided they wouldn't

ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a weeks ago before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's vow to enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens authorized immigrants born in America\nCame in an interview with ... was released yesterday Trump did not say when they signed the order and some of his past promises using executive action have gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions in tend to just rushed\nThe matter of immigration into the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like\nIt was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore and you know what that means you don't want to help this country together all these years is the\nHonoring him a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and all of us really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who had a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago\nYou can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate waivers people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got a job but Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won and added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most\nPart and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify

with the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they\nDidn't want it we've gotten to a point\nWhere the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election and its results and the\nWay this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O.
