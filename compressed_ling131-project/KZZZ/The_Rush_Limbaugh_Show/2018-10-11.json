those\nYeah and and so and but the important thing blame that that that comes from real people too and you can't really distinguish what comes first like chicken or the egg did the did the Russian you know ... or troll on line plant the thought in a conservative or you know activists or Star Wars fan on line and then they sort of echo it\nOr did it go the other way around um because it is reasonable to look at Star Wars and see some sort of like you know progressive fingers in the pot but there's also this discourse on line that happens where you sort of amplify\nOther opinion is that you see you see someone upset about the ... now taking over Star Wars Kathleen Kennedy or you know the uh the Asian girl and the new Star Wars movie\nAnd if you get amplified about that and feel like oh well someone else's angry about that too I can now feel a little bit more angry then the the discourse just rapidly\nUm gets more radical and it's pretty reasonable to think that there are foreign actors who engage in this malicious activity\n... even if it's interesting I think this is part of the crime against journalism that's happened making every effort of what Russia has tried to do in America about Donald Trump\nYou know it's like we look at the look at the scope of this the fact that they are trying to go in there and ... people up over ... culture and in in Star Wars and and all

pushing us into a place I hear this all the time I Know I Am\nLike this ... when did everything becomes political\nThey're pushing everything all pop culture everything into politics\nYeah there was a great book out right now called addicted to outraged\nBy going back towards the towards the end part wine in at least in the audio book it's chapter Nineteen\nTalking a lot about the role that foreign actors and particularly Russians might play and trying to sow discord and what we do know about Russia's wet were able to do in the twenty sixteen election we don't know if they actually were able to impact the results and how people voted\nBut we are able to determine that they they get their fingers into the way that we talk um and\nWhat's most important I think about American politics and culture is not that we are able to agree on everything political but that were actually able to go to a movie theater and sit next to our neighbors in the dark\nAnd smile at a star wars movie but then when you go in and you've sort of been reading these things on line and you've had people tell you that it now it's like liberal propaganda and that it's not the star wars you grew up with\nThen you can't even do that and think about what that does to a culture not in the course of one year but in the course of ten years we have will will have nothing in common if we allow people to manipulate us like this and get us hooked on outrage on a constant basis about anything whether it's politics or media\nSee even at the thank you for I'm writing about this is in the Washington Examiner thank you for was to go vote the writing about this is it is it because it was Star Wars that this popped up on your radar or why is it that no one else is is catching this Steven\nWell I Would say that there was a pretty good deal of riding down about this and for me I didn't catch that because I've got Google alert set up for Star Wars and I mean but you know I\nI live and Star Wars Twitter as well as conservative and libertarian Twitter the these are kind of the different ecosystems and the dialogue and Star Wars Twitter is is toxic\nIt was so me but when these movies came out particularly around so low in the last ... last jet I really sort of agitated right wing Twitter\nAnd solo really add a agitated left wing Twitter everybody was arguing about these different things and just using language that you just don't see or you didn't see a couple of years ago in Star Wars and then you turn on your favorite conservative podcast right and I have a couple\nAnd their sort of been echoing those sentiments and then their actual fans are going out and engaging and Star Wars discourse\nBut there's it's not really clear like who is genuine and who is not and who is coming to it as a really interested fan who's coming to as a political activists who just really wants to make people angry and that's what we have to remember when we get on line is there is no guarantee that the person even
