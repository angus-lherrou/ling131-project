would be easier with capital with his record\nUh that the Democrats will be loaded for bear against a woman because this ... Amy Coney Barrett when she did her confirmation hearings for her current position on the court Dianne Feinstein said to her the dog mine is thick with you isn't it meaning\nLet rape victims of sexual abuse victims um it depends on on on the victims some of them have vivid recall of every detail like this and some some uh some don't but I heard they range or and descriptions of the house in a place for the people there who all denial\nI and the timing of all if you put this whole package together\nIt just [laughter]\nAnd the reason for it to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this is spontaneous happenstance [noise] [noise] I don't think Feinstein just received a letter she didn't know it was coming\nJust don't believe it can't prove it\nJust don't believe it I don't believe he's minding your own business one day at a letter from a constituency who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\n[noise] well [laughter] it just it doesn't make any sense unless\nPut it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign to withdraw or for Trump to withdraw from I think it was beginning to unravel because Trump and Kevin all have hung in and buy unravel I mean be exposed\nYeah and my unravel I mean be exposed for the phone is that much of it is anyway Suzie I'm Glad you called\nThank you thank you very much Miami, Florida next Robert your up great to have you\n[noise] hey Russia that it was from a lifelong Wilson and I've been listening to you for Thirty years [noise] um I just want to thank you for everything you do for the country and especially your leukemia and lymphoma a song that you do once\nA year that's that's what I'm tough chicken it means a lot to me [laughter] thank you sir [laughter] my question is what's what do you think is going on with the mother pro because it ... if you\nDon't well now that's an interesting question what's going on with the mother probably was the latest I heard the caller probe the the story actually has a sentence and\nThe special counsel's office and Robert Mueller to third us choir most in\nMost most honest man on the order what it is shedding prosecutors shedding process now when your cat or dog shed that means they're losing hair a mother is losing prosecutors meaning their\nTheir their jobs on those not in their ... their ... their moving away and are going off to other things\nThere's less and less for his team of Trump haters to what to do I'll just repeat what I said at the very opening of the program I don't think this tax story would have run today\nIf Mueller we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story wouldn't ... when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left\nAnd nothing happens by accident the times didn't just finished the story\nBy deadline last night there by making it able to be published they'd been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year and they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the times found it how they reported it how they prompted\nHow they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today\nFirst reaction I had was a cabinet thing must really be unraveling 'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle\nAnd it's not really new its taxes the latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen somebody more recent but\nThe last story I saw on this is Muller [laughter] [noise] I don't know what to believe in that Mueller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone in an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia\nAnd Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold out of his money and get more of it Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity what Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty ... you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election I'll be cause of the impact that it would have and they of course\nAre ah unbiased ended it totally objective in the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I which is all they've been trying to do it for two years\nI wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude excoriated or have a really really shady friends and all that but doesn't accused him of anything\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen is the way these people operate but but maybe it won't outside of that\nI'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to reveal I don't know what he's going to report um ... you wrote not at all I Know is that the drive by media of decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the Kavanaugh story [laughter]\nRush Limbaugh for the way to get high net worth it\nGood news you are
