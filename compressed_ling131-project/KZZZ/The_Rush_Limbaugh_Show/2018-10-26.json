of this I Am reporting it to you under\nGuidance and telling you that I I just tell you what I'm finding in uh in various publications that are that are floating around there has been a a mad cap and desire to id who ever was sending these bombs as a Trump supporter a all week long and they have not waited\nThey are they're moving\nAt light speed to make this association such as in this headlines\nSuspected make America great again bomber ID as Native American Trump supporters say is our ... or say Iraq\nA fifty six [noise] so [noise]\nThere is and then still have this this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this screen shot of a website that list is party is the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a\nA bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down now in the midst of this there continues\nTo be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers van\nAh down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the things that I had intended to share with you today is Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday and we have an audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that\nChuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare Chuck\nTodd said that he theory the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party\nAs well to CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and that is so all of this confusion\n\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the mail bomb scare is dividing that country\nAnd that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press\nDaily\nNow I ... the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is noteworthy about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press\nHave Chuck Todd who's still believes\nDespite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd still operating under the believe the Russians stole the two thousand sixteen election\n\nAnd so you think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose their not nightmare and going to win the house back Democrats than a nice day thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nDemocrats and the and the nice thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state loses they can say the election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean I like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being out a lot of trouble\nTheoretically ... eventually the gears of justice Ryan slowly but you'd like to believe actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct\nThese investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow wrote this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once was elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him if they really\nHave to say let's discuss it you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there's no wrong answer who do this don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think the compass essentially on the ballot this\nThese midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in total are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment where they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the unpredictable\nI Will if somebody would I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this is my hobby not keeping up with the blockers meant keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by a bunch of young millennial\nJournalist and they have ever since election day two thousand sixth day and they haven't been in various stages of panic\nAnd I I'm a\n... there was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mild to panic about it\nWriting about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty and was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off results it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says\nBut if the Republicans hold the house of representatives we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was um I wouldn't say there was panic and ended up reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some people ... the last two years they have live with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand sixteen was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidate with the\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake and the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct is missing now they're starting to\nBegin to quite maybe this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority and it kinda dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example\nThat a Trump\nVoters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum to vote because of his mom's now\nHow can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went out of Trump\nRally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats\nFor this event was sitting like twelve thousand I'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line there were more women than there were men there wherever Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAmericans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters and my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters when I got down there like me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do\nAnd so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and poke how how could you hold it against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote that they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing an under sleeves like these crazy radical leftist are all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that uh this week a bomb scare stories can dampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more made I think more than the average Trump voter I I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that continued you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important is because I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a usual lessening\nOf enthusiasm more gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important\nIt is it was it's as important now is it was in two thousand six team in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he he pronounced he's got he's got a track record now is it\nTwo years ago on the campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again we're going to stop there's going to make a trade deals better but back then it was just\nWords that was just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think from so supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to just spirit them a or to somehow weaken their enthusiasm so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks for the extended time we'll be back after\nThis
