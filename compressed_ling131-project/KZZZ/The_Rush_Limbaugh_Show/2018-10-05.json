ultimate purpose of this country society if a white man didn't get what he wanted it was nothing short of a constitutional crisis\nBingo these people prove me write each and every time I go analyzing them so the trouble with America is it it was a stab Bush by white men for white man and the pursuit of happiness\nAnd life and liberty was only intended for white man and if any white man was struck in the pursuit then there was something wrong with America do not minimize this I'm telling you this belief is animating the last two generations informing the last two generations\nOf kids are going

guy Michael list uh\nIn the New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaugh's crying because he's a white man targeted singled out for advancement in America by other white men and when it's not going his way breaks down and cries\nThis piece justifies the attack on white men it says it's about time the whole country and the assault on the whole country is validated because it's actually an assault on a

his name is Jennifer Rubin\nA beard is\nJennifer Rubin it's amazing the transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger then when Trump got elected she became I think what she's always been just a diet and the cats in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has a this though the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed her that way but that's not the point\nI couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes to the deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the\nFemale Democratic senators were being so emotional almost hysterical\nBehaving as if it's their time of the month does anybody think that would lie\nThere is no way\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support enable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way\nSadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind but conservative populist coalition that elected Trump needed something outside\nElected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nIn other words in her study of things just\nContinuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why I Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters that first and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range have somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and re awaken these beep and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful\nThat it's all about being strong it helped to remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from the capital by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen thousand Eighteen midterms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people voted for Trump by deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people to vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for a very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild the military bring back the economy I Would think people have voted for Trump\nKnew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nWhat is her insistent no that's kind of stuff it evaporates and wanes you know people's lives don't want the news changes but that this Kavanaugh circus has re ignited the coalition that electing Trump and this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could indeed say a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nI found it interesting analysis and I I'm One of his

be able to sue them I don't think that uh once you start getting into the government government officials and so forth are kind of get a you got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything and we can lie about whoever and whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it\nThe the uh the remedy for that is more speech which in
