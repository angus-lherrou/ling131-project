have if you want to send an email I checked the Mitchell rushed ball empty I mean that the U.S [noise]\nOkay so the FBI report was delivered [noise]\nChuck Grassley Grassley\nSaid hey there's nothing new witness everything in this we knew which was eminently predictable\nThey still have the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset\nFolks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate walls e forge testimony\nThey weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate\nSweating like they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the sevens FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe leftist others but they didn't talk to Dr Ford didn't talk to Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of a deal they testify under oath what\nMore can the FBI where do you think the FBI I really think these people don't change their stories from what they testified under oath\nBesides that\nDr forged testimony changed any way in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or Kevin always they've talked to Kavanaugh for how many times over the years\nUm but they testified under oath\nAnd so the the thing is no reason to talk to them to go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying the FBI couldn't find any\nSo I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it here and it was probably ten minutes ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\nThe impression that the Democrats think they lost it gives a little CNN report it only looks little to me he was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this was a very thorough is is that this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nYou know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very thorough\nNot just among them but among people on the right in general and now here is the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves\nIt was the payoff NPR without they pulled it themselves and they found that exactly what I had been saying has come to pass the capital hearings were back firing big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they planted supporter Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm election right now\nI'm so this this is happening and they only primary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it I've even seen stories today\nAmong the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually re unite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran an operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park I mean it got booed because the millennials in the crowd have no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people have not lived through Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this is their first\nAnd that means it is the worst smear\nCampaign ever that they've seen could ever you want to be smeared more\nCan anybody smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence even vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life where I Lived when you boil\nAll this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any Republican vote against the guy\nAnd in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats Senate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes urging Rick House Republicans that go ahead and vote for capital as a way this was back firing on him\nI\nDon't know that it's a wild guess and only time will tell when we get to the vote but the FBI investigation at the Democrats want it appears to have provided cover\nFor both Susan Collins and Jeff Flake we don't know where Murkowski is on any of this yeah of course there's the red state Democrats senators that now have\nA a big decision to make salt\nAre

Democrats are filing outta Chuck Schumer his office stone faced\nThe meaning is they're coming out that many they're depressed to their no expressions on their faces they're not happy in a stone faced their shell shocked there's something or other now why would that be\nWhy well did the Democrats on that committee\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nSo I don't know how anybody could honestly folks\nWithout an I I'm not even being part is when I say this she can't\nRemember where where why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although ... did the Democrats and that can be really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the Kavanaugh nomination\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they know that there's nothing other than the ... this is all this has managed to all they got it they really thought\nThat this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations and countless other interviews and written questions having produced\nWell that is shocking honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but\nAnd here is what Ben Sasse said last night on the Senate\nWe all know that the president cannot lead us through it\nTonight on the Senate floor we all know that the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that he's just viscerally unable to restrain his impulse to divide a mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong\nBut it doesn't really surprise anyone who years\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you is I Need you to consider something senators asked you and\nNumerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggest that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this it's who he is he can't help but\nThat's just asked I think it's the other way around I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump has a behavioral patterns of strategic ... it's called pacing and when he briefly explaining it again in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford what any ... compelling testimony riveted he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's lied and it's definitely gone Trump said all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nNot every time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way and every time he does it do not some of you panic\nMaybe you don't have any more\nBut when he first started doing this white Paris climate accord yeah yeah there may be something to here we're going to look at it they don't always going to vote no doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dump detail with what the swamp sex\nBut then a few days or are we go by him\nAnd the president's becomes really is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it have something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced still look and listen to that little riff\nOn Dr forge shaky uncorroborated I'm provable testimony to drive by it's we're never\nGonna tell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nMust be cause he said what he said about her he forced the drive by its cover what he said in the process that Dr buys recorded what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving the vapors gave me the vapor who am I got Trump is always uses horrible 'cause this is your main he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did\nRecounting the surgeon inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media on all day yesterday\n\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies with Dr Ford's testimony the drive by media did not report on on none of the corroborate shouldn't being possible they did not tell their audience is\nThat the foreign people foreign place in the room with her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nOther than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't pack up what she was saying that people watch the mainstream media had no idea that the foreign witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nDr vice were not reporting any they have to drive my eyes were reporting what the Democrats senators I Believe her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned the woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital was guilty\nAnd it was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets it on the records of drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth about\nDr Christine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think about millions have never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterized it for everybody think of it this way think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\n\nDetail that for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no collaboration they know that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if\nWe had an honest ... millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protests today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous\nThe people\nThese protests thinks she's telling the God's truth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told him the Democratic senators haven't told them only Trump did\nSome other reason why they hate him but we don't have an honest media and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls the foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying\nNo how Robert ration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump or his go literally in saying that if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump did say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\n\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a [noise]\n[noise] [noise]

V. network high high paying\nThe reason I'm calling is because uh\nI Believe that if the Democrats keep complaining that the investigation the FBI investigation is not thorough enough that um they made the right\nThat investigation needs to investigate Dr Ford the reason being is that that we don't know anything about Dr Ford was she taking drugs\nWe joke Jews are Democrats believe heard that's all anybody should\nBe taking drugs that she ever done this before ... with Democratic Party and democratic members big time members\nAlso there's two people who are on the scene and that's her and having\nOne of them is why why don't mix committing perjury we know nothing about her and we need to know more about her if they keep complaining about that we know everything we need to know what that Kavanaugh had a hundred and fifty people talk to seven investigate and get me and nothing about her\nI Can't dispute any of that that in fact that's a great point\nAt as an absolutely great point we don't know thinking about her nobody is investigating her because of Democrats will say that you have to believe her\nDana and we we we can but what seat on drugs I mean you know what's going on here you know there's all kinds of things\nThat's going on here is they're trying to railroad a guy oh don't lose control of the Supreme Court in their mind\nI Know but nobody is responding to them appropriately which move you got to put it back on that you know well investigations investigate port we don't know anything\nI think that cases like this year lawyers would probably ... especially especially if their programming a story for you to tell\n[noise] okay my mother told me for alcohol I ...

handbag but God still went it but we need to bring 'em back and we need to repent because look at where it's going\nAnd the Democrats are not going to win and two thousand four can I say uh me and my friend who were watching The Apprentice and after three showing I just said just word it out I said if that man speaking of Donald Trump I said if that man ever runs for president he will win\nSo I knew he was gonna when my friends like are worried he stay up all night watching\nTo see if he was going to when I went to bed I said don't wake me up 'cause I Know he's going to be president but I Can't believe the hell they have put him through\nWhen Obama won presidency I respect the fact that he won I didn't vote for him but when I knew Donald Trump was wondering I ran around getting people to vote I got I got several people\nTo even go and register to vote because I knew how important it was but I didn't know what was going to get this bad\nYeah I'm a [noise] a lot of people probably didn't but I'm I'm Still struck by what almost happened to you and how you hold your ... your would love\nTo sit down with you and talk to you about it I mean it it it it's just amazing what God can

that interesting given what you've been through that you don't believe Dr Ford\nI you know and I've sat down I prayed about it and I just keep re running her what I've seen in her testimony\nUm there wasn't don't she's there wasn't a lot of emotion on her side and I ultimately I have a testimony September fifteenth of two thousand sixteen two thousand pick as when I open that like I have to do aside\nAnd God stepped in and that's when my whole life change because for forty five years I just wanted to die because I couldn't handle all the pain\nAnd your turkey do aside as recently as two

in and said no and so you're not you're not going to do this year and I don't want you to die I have more purpose in your life than less\nWell ... is it a comprehensible but I Know what happens but they\nSee an end and watching her but also not only watching her I Believe that the lord was showing me look at she she told everybody she can't why because she's scared to fly so we're looking at her character of the whole from what little we know\nAnd their lives leading up to the ultimate if she hadn't ... the little lies builds up on sand right\nShe's scared to fly and then all of a sudden she gets on a plane and she flies but we also find out that she's flown all over the world so there's ... were were where she stands right now you know she's not a very strong she doesn't have a very strong testimony in the beginning you understand what I'm saying\nWell totally I I Do I I I think she's all political like all of this is political I I I think their best revising was hold me too movement here I think ... great damage to it\nShe ... yes yes because people saw how much in the beginning it was true and and it was true and it's almost like\nAll right but then the Democrats hold

this I have to get over it it's it's not easy to do that but I knew that\n... you know what happened was not going to get me anywhere in life so I understand in a way why no one you know talked up and now these days you know twenty Thirty years ago\nIt was not the way it was it was not [noise] we weren't we didn't think people were like that and we didn't want to look at it if it was it's horrible that we've made good progress on that\nYes we have however we swung from one end all the way to the other with no middle ground so what I'm Upset about is that everyone believes this this doctor\nOkay just on her ... a testimony which wasn't even you know significant and uh they're they they just believe that because of the health they went through and to me I don't understand why they don't listen to the facts\nAnd this is one of the things that's so disturbing about this the obviously the me too concept is really really important and very important like it it really it it could make a real difference and instead what it's turning into is here's a tool for Democrats used to destroy people's lives\nWhich is an awful outcome or what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion is that going forward or people like Phyllis would would be believed\nWould at least be taken seriously and you've taken seriously believe just they have the evidence taken seriously and and and and\nAnd would not fear coming out because if you had\nA evidence and you had a a real story to tell it would be believed correct\nAnd that's that's that is the outcome that I think rational Americans are looking for me they want this to and they think this is horrible but they don't want to\nIt's the end they think this is horrible\nBut they don't want to go the other way this has to become um a vendetta you know fill us as you said you knew that the anger wasn't going to get you anywhere in life so you had to deal with it\nIf you deal with the is the situation um you have a chance to grow it is much better if the person who has done it to you has\nUm has ... it's a consequences or or has has you know admitted it at least or something it's hard when people don't apologize or don't admit it and they just get away with it is really really hard\nBut that sometimes what happens but by by moving on with your life\nYou're not trying to convict every man and that's what's happening right now there are these women who have suffered this and have not healed and so they want everybody to be believed because no one would believe there's\nAnd so they don't they don't you know that they don't know if it's true or not but nobody believed me and this woman's gonna be railroaded what no your situation is not their situation\nAnd we have to base it on facts Phyllis thanks for your call hey Jay in Oregon hello AJ you're on the Glenn Beck program\nHi Glenn how slow I'm a recovering addict of outlet [laughter] okay\nSo what I Want to call and talk about it I've been listening to the audio book it's great\nAnd I kind of at my wife and I kind of had like ... points\nAnd I and it really hit me when I was listening yesterday is a social media outrage is what's driving this country more than anything like you're saying that both you know Tommy thirty six ... like what apple right is and and it's got to the point where\nWe just our life is so much happier by not engaging with politics on line yeah and part of that social media mob it it's it got to the point where my wife and I just for like looking at each other oh my gosh\nI Can't handle this and I I even took on more volunteer opportunities will help with youth basketball everything like that\n... ... and I feel so ... now\nYou get did you end up social media or did you did you just cut down on it\nI cut down on the uh outrage the absolute engaging with some family members\nThat were progressive where you could you couldn't even talk to them it's like beating your head against a brick wall him was so frustrating I mean we don't even when we go to family dinners\nWe don't even talk about politics and we're all you know a lot of us are constitutional conservatives but we don't talk about it because it's so bad right now\nIt it's it is it's what's it this book is perfect it's perfect titles it's perfect for I think everybody should be reading it\nThanks a lot of Jay appreciate I'm going to send you a copy of

should be able to agree on all men are created equal life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the the the ten amendments to the constitution\nOkay let's start there that's what brought people here\nAnd that's what's being lost in the conversation we're arguing over parties and personalities that Kavanaugh is really about it's not about did he do it or did he not do it if she lying as she telling the truth it is about are you\nInnocent until proven guilty do we presume innocence do we look for facts\nIs there a system in society outside of the legal standards where did the legal standards come from the legal standards came from a group of people in our founders and prior to that\nHere in America they came here and said you know what I can just be taken off the streets I can be destroyed if somebody just says hey I'm I'm I'm the king or I'm a I'm a lord rhyme at Duke and this person did that they're believed it I'm not\nI'm a I'm a lord rival Duke and this person did that they're believed it I'm not no matter what the evidence is that's not right I don't want that those are the big principles and those are the things that we need to slowly start to re engage our loved

think that there is a chance of this because of this have you seen Ronan Farrow lighting his credibility on fire over the past couple of weeks on the story yeah he first came out and said oh well none of the New York times none of the other major sources would run the story about the woman who said that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself with a party\nAnd then Ronan Farrow who is still devolve his credibility with real reporting on things like Harvey Weinstein\nOr comes out and people take it seriously 'cause it's him when you read the story you find out about two thirds the way through that
