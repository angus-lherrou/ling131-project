with that and ah how old is it\nTwo thousand and one side figuring it's probably got about a hundred health\nDoing All right now today you're asking about fuel what can we do for [noise]\nI I've just rebuilt it uh it changed everything and I'm Wondering kind I run a premium on that than to get a little bit more or no hour on science bogged down no no\nNo actually they were it'll it'll whatever problems you're having a it'll make it worth it let's let's explain that when when a engine is manufacture I don't care who manufactures the real key word to the process for fuel is compression ratio\nThe higher the compression ratio the more fuel required the acting is required from the fuel\nSo if you have a one more in your ... compression ratios like one to one [laughter] I'm I'm exaggerating that it's not very high maybe six and a half to one or something like that or higher\nUm you don't need any acting to satisfy that age and so\nBy putting in a premium octane fuel what you'll actually do is slow down the flame front within the combustion chamber which will actually leave debris inside the combustion chamber\nAnd not do not get the whole power so you would actually do in reverse to what you think you'd be doing to do not use premium fuel right the only exception to that of course is you know a lot of manufacturers like leaf blowers in that in different items do recommend premium fuels so\nBut that's because it's a high compression high compression engine so the the issue and your point\nSo it's a high compression high compression engine so the the issue and your point if it's bogged down a little bit or you know if it's a five or she need to go to a seven horse and [laughter]\nAnd I'm going to hold on quite a quick question and tearing it down I was surprised to find the fuel filter between the gas tank and the\nHarvard well actually there is a field filter it inside the fuel tank if you have a metal tank there was a screen at the bottom of the pickup or a the sometimes will be a screen depending if the carburetor boats to the top of the tank I I don't know what are you could have two different versions was your carburetor bolted to the fuel tank or it was a separate\nUh separate from the ... on their toes right there's there should be screened in the tank I was what she'll find so 'cause I was thinking of cutting the hose and putting it in like\nOh you can see how they do make the small in line a filter keep in mind though uh you know it's it could be a fire hazard due to the fact that you want to make sure that when you do cut the line it's away from the engine or sometimes the filter itself close to the hot engine can cause perky elation\nOr in other words boil the fuel when it's in the field filter so you got to be very careful\nOkay\nAll right You're welcome have a good day appreciated the Bob Let's go now to Sharon Sharon has an oath to Chevy Trailblazer Sharon how many miles on your trailblazer\nOut one eighty one eighty three\nAll right and today you're calling about your abs breaks tell us about this poll station\nOkay on and get out and they all said and then it sounds like a rubber band and so I took it and I got older I had\nThe same thing the only asked someone mechanic and all that could be a real ... and the fact that a little sensor and they're\nThey do and all kinds of one higher and you have to be a place to live\nYeah what let's explain that if you don't understand cheer and first of all uh your your your trailblazer has ADS or anti lock brakes system which is really good uh your abs light is not on is that correct\nYeah quite a feat for the phone and it is a part of the the uh [laughter] okay [laughter]\nThat that's what it does show and let me ask you a question and do the brakes still policy now okay okay oh Jay bad\nIdea because what you've just done although it is I mean you have a standard brake system like you did before abs not a great idea not terrible but if you need a BS function of your vehicle or it won't work so\nHere's what we're going to recommend that you do with the berry because the your your gentleman that told you that is absolutely\nCorrect right or because of the age of the vehicle in the miles it doesn't necessarily have to be the wheels speed censor you also have wires that will come up and run down to lower control arms and\nThink about it a little bit over the last hundred and eighty thousand miles how many times the wheels turn left right up down one million seven ... five thousand so the wires themselves she may have a problem where you have a contact and not to contact\nSo before we condemn the censors you need to take it somewhere they can actually read the abs codes and if it says something like a C O one wants three or she'll one one for\nWe're at say an intermittent a shortcut then I Would suspect to be more wiring then it would be the sensor so let's not condemned it I wouldn't want you to go out and spend four hundred dollars and then find out it was a wiring problem a harness problem that could have been repaired\nOn the other hand if if you replace the a bearing and speed sensors simply which is probably what you're doing then with the connector um you'll you'll probably fix it at the same time so you'll never know anything\nWell with the lawyers are on the control arm and not at the Barry my point is the real science in it that's right I Know where I Know\nWell you could go to something like this you're going to have to take it to an automotive repair shop because most most part stores and things like that too that do offer that free service do not have the ability to do that they're mainly looking at engine Dr ability problems or check engine light problems and not a problem like this so anywhere you\nAnywhere doesn't necessarily have to be the dealer could be a private ah independent shopping at least get that code red and in fact at that point or you know it's going to tell you if it says intermittent circuit with the CEO number than we know what's the wiring problem and not censor problem\nAnd if they find that they'll fix that relatively inexpensively um but if they say it's going to need a bearing and uh uh with the sensory included and you can put that into your budget later but the main thing is you want to have it read\nRight now the brakes were performed at a shopper was done on your own\nYou know they they put the ads and all that kind of attack\nAt the shop okay because normally to if it was a bearing the Ninety nine percent of the time the reason why you're changing the bearings because there is movement very seldom censor fail internally so if there is no movement in the ... and again we'll go back to the wearing\nA moment\nYou've met in the ... and again we'll go back to the wiring\n\nLike in other words if you were to if you put the vehicle up in the air and you you took your wheel and you should get back and forth\nAnd if there's a lot of ... not a lot but if there are some play in there we know that the bearing a yearly or any noise when you're driving the vehicle now okay yeah in a very would tell you that but it's the sensor part of the bearing\nWhich sometimes you could buy individually sometimes you buy some macho right but again just that's very important you start with the wiring yes\nOur now and it's just a good idea well here let me answer is\nThe way I Would answer it and that is that it's not a bad idea as long as you'd never use your abs feature on your vehicle so what that means is if you get into a panic stop\nAnd you try to stop very quickly and has to be around something then you'll see golly I Wish to the future work because I just hit something that I otherwise would not have to\nGet it and it\nSaid oh\nYes that's correct very good I like ...\nYou're welcome Sharon thanks for calling us here on the car show\nAnd I think that's a great point that we always tell people when you're trying to diagnose problems start with the most basic things first work your way up because sometimes it's the littlest thing that\nNot the biggest the screening you're right like the TV at home it doesn't turn around and make sure it's a lot Dana [laughter] so I give a a a big screen TV\nAnd you know I never hear anything so I go over to his house one day and he goes yeah you know TV gave me doesn't work\nAnd I'm going doesn't work what are you talking about and I'm thinking here's a really ungrateful guy riding given this nice big screen TV and ever since they just want to be the hall and Al Al for like ... it has to work long story short it was a which on the remote or whatever yeah wrong and I turned it on even what\nOh there you go Mr the TV doesn't work so well you know Dan is kind of an oxymoron a little bit bigger on the one end of that\nYeah he's fine it's very good [laughter]\nHe's very he's amazing your car and all that much and and a lot of other things he's really good with that big screen TV and I know what you're looking at it in the corner going that's taking a lot of room in this room\nThat they have out of work I gave it to get it\nYou were on average riders for a week he goes where you go to watch I went back and I'm like oh\nLet's say you're gear spotlight is brought to you by Walker products are leading manufacturer quality fuel system components an engine sensors do these vehicles are being pushed the new heights with increased fuel economy and fewer tailpipe emissions\nThis was created the need for a smarter and more sophisticated exhaust after treatment system featuring an array of sensors designed to monitor and control the different aspects of vehicle operation and help me GT or exhaust gas temperature sensor plays a major role\nGirl is good so you got ... ... no ... um what kind of hard is it an ... corn\nGot it sounds more like a like a like a like a semi truck\nOh you know and therefore you're there that'll go the double ... well we love the fact you love your pickup truck that's a that's a very good thing so good luck on on keeping and running and you wanted to keep it around forever you look at it as being a classic I get that fuel gauge aides\nSay gene or you know what they call your pick up truck yeah in Texas now your Cadillac [laughter]\nMy neighbor everyone calls it the green or you\nKnow you go All right well they were that horn I guess it was a very good already Gina good luck on your vehicle thanks for calling thank you you have a great\nWay to tell us what [laughter] I Love it since I was really under vehicle it's great let's go to a Larry Larry has a uh in Nineteen Ninety eight Chevy Silverado how many miles Larry\nA hundred and Seventy nine thousand four hundred and form a\nVery good and what kind of gauge is you are you having here\nUm the game on the gas tank gauge letters it'll it'll go empty go past everything\nThe uh survey thing can light comes on the ah\nAnti break break light and the a break like that and it doesn't stay in a good\nRunning manner it's a faith up slows down the ...\nThe check engine light has ever anyone read to see what service codes are stored in the system yes it does\nBut anyone read to see what service codes are stored in the system\nYes it does it it doesn't say anything about\nThat okay so here's what's gonna happen you'll fixed the check engine light when you repair the fuel gauge ... just because of the censoring the fuel tank\nOkay that'll eliminate that that's why you can't read any code because it's not an emission control fault it's it's more of a uh the end on the fuel system\nThe abs light same thing again let's go back to the basics on that along with the brake light or\nEven if you would have a break fluid that's a little lower than normal in the reservoir there is a level censored there at the level is below the censor it will trigger the brake light and the abs light so did you do the basics to make sure that the masters soldier is full of a break fluid\nOkay I had a problem with the wind place okay and they let it come out\nRight that is why the abs and the brake light as soon as you take care of the hydraulic problem now another issue on your vintage truck and your your truck they were known for having abs pumping motors assembly would fail for example when the brake lines rotted out\nYou stepped on the brake pedal wants to the floor and activated the abs and if the ATF system is not used in other words will say it went dormant for four or five years in the sense of where you didn't have an emergency stoppers light on ice\nThis pitched in inside the\nUh abs pumping motor somebody will become stuck so that's another problem so you you have air in the system and most likely you have a problem with the AIDS pump motors simply\nSo again what you need someone to do is read the service code on that and and if it says you know high hydraulic motor failure or anything in that order a than we know for a fact that that abs pumped assembly has to be replaced\nAnd then again after its replace a proper bleeding procedure a that's going to take care of the rest of the breaking problem\nSo it's like a\nA victim in the ... the the ... bought motor assembly when the brake lines failed and rusted\nAll right the very good for the call you have a good day there Larry when we come back we're going to talk to a

you get the uh the booklets\n\nThat when there's an additional Jackson I that that's an ad it'll it'll come on ...\n\n[laughter] well you know this is the time of year that you need to really consider\nHaving really hold on just a few that wonderful weather coming up and I'm not going to mention\nWhat the end result is that it's not well\nIn ... mind to keep in mind you do not have to have tigers that are involved are are almost to the end of the useful life as much as the fact that it's called heat cycling you can still have a lot of travel left on the tire but it becomes ... when they go oh yeah not\nSeven year old and he comes Hardman when it becomes harder the hungry any\nYou do what you sound like it used to ... stay I asked him if if it was All right well you've you've terrified me to the point where I Will be walking home later what stops your\nHuh what's stylish our head on me you know I don't remember we had a rich and every one time when we did Cindy yeah yeah yeah that's right oh we did all remember Steve are some things that we were just talking about yeah\nLady is well her partner brought in a Grinch a Grinch for Christmas when we were doing like the music when we bring out the mountain no sponsored we had yeah oh\nOh yeah yeah yeah\nYeah that was scary it's like a clown that scared me right I could live an hour that was long gone I won't sleep tonight now All right thanks very much I was okay I live uh let's answer file insurance on\nThe no okay let's move on one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five seven we now go to\nFrank and Frank has an eighty four Porsche to nine forty four Frank how many miles on your Porsche\nSeventy two thousand All right\nVery nice you must keep very good care of that car that must be a good weather only cars I write\nWell it's a friend of mine's car and he inherited it oh and I'm trying to get it run it\nAll right so you say it turns over but there is no spark right okay so you have a two point five is that correct leader for soldier engine\nYeah it's an engine with a trans acts on the air\nRight now tell me a little bit about it because I have to Ninety four that's that those are eighty four those are the years that they had all sorts of different um a ignition systems as well as fuel system so help me now remind me is this a fuel injected mechanical or not\nYeah it's it's fuel injected and uh it's one of those weird ones the fuel pumps outside the tank and been replaced okay I got fuel\nOr replace both reference sensors and the clock child saying okay I put out a new fuel pump relay or re manufacture\nWhich you're not getting any spark\nRight and what it's got a new car\nSmell on it and I'm getting voltage on both primary terminals with the ignition on\nI'm also getting full voltage at an injector\nConnector on both sides of the connector\nI got voltage are going into injector but there's no voltage on the secondary\nGoing under the distributor\nOkay we'll keep in mind you're always going to have a voltage at the injector and then the computer turns around on and off in order to\nPhase the injector now when you first turn the key on you hear the fuel pumps run yes\nOkay so we're fine there um where I always liked is to start especially on vehicles like this had have been sending around is you need to get a a can of uh electrical connector cleaner\nOr you can go to like to an old Riley auto parts store or wherever and there's a couple of companies like ... and some others that manufacture this and start off with every connection first okay that's most important thing now you said you've changed the reference sensors okay which is good I'm normally they do fail because they're nothing more than magnets\nNow the other issue would be after you do the cleaning you also want to check grounds check the ground from the battery you know to the blockers frame wherever the ground is at a in many cases where we have a no spark condition like you're experiencing it's just because of the lost ground\nAnd if you're familiar with how to use a digital vote on major into a voltage dropped tests that that sometimes is going to be able to help you find what's wrong\nAgain you know it's been sitting probably for a while and uh we always have to go back to the basics and the basics would be to do that cleaning first off so important in fact you you sometimes won't even see what forums this white type corrosion that conform over the connector and all it has to be is just\nYou just need to do a little cleaning and in many cases just you know you spray the or the cleaner and both ends plug it in plug unplugging plugging in and unplug it and go about everything you can find now and then in the last thing of\nUnplug it and go about everything you can find now\nAnd then in the last thing of course in a lot of guys don't like changing and then that would be the model that controls all that you could ever possibly a bad solder joints or maybe an inside many cases you could probably take the unit apart or the ... I Believe it's called the DMZ macho taken apart look inside\nShe if there's any cold solder joints and so you know you can have that repaired but again go back to the basics get probably ran when it was parked\nAnd just by setting around it's you know my my\nArea would be as bad a bad connection\nOkay ah [noise]\nI'll tell you [noise]\nIt's it's got me stumped\nWell that's why in you're going to be stumped but the you know but they have the weather can actors in other words there's supposed to not eggs a absorbs moisture uh over the years they get harder and but just disconnect spray sprayed both the female and mail and do that and then connect them just connect and connect them a couple of times that'll clean 'em and believe it or not\nYou can do one connector at a time to find out exactly which one was bad\nRight and then the other issue is too don't forget that even though many ignition wires are not actual wire their carbon filled in wrapped\nYou could even have a spark plug wire he'll say for example like an ignition coil wire that could be dead that that's another issue you also want to take a look at that make sure that the coil I wouldn't even check them I'd replace yeah because of the age yeah All right\nThough very good Frank thanks for your call here on the car show one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five seven we now go to Michael has two thousand twelve dodge charger and ah Michael you want to store this for the winter\n\nHello Michael\n...

ex donor okay and you know that on that engine it should have one large long coil pack yeah OK replaced that you replace coil pack okay and then did you check before you did that it doesn't necessarily have to be spark\nA not uncommon for injector problems so you know there's like five different things that can create a missed fire it can be a band plug it could be a bad coil or you could have an intake leak a vacuum leak\nI'm an injector which is pretty common with that kind of miles and that's it you're easy it's easy enough to access the ... where we don't care what they read just as long as they read the same you can unplug all the electrical connector is off the ... and use a digital photo meter and if you go to one\nAnd he's checking it reads three homes and the next

Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight is Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing is like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you drive\nThe way I'm dumb 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank\nGod for that aren't the cycle man the if it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because\nI started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I was going to a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nIt's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite puddle of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or Greek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gave on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience George ...\nTension is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgia and I want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly core portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch and so\nThe idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her and so then when you go in there\nYour mind is charged with that intention and so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble\nOr the right thing you know you have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you will well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set\nUp a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair and so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kinda stuff uh yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with a and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people ... it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about um oh maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on it\nThat's dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warped sense of UFOs here's our first emerging artists all Ruben from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\nWho is a\nWe're of course that plays turned out to the area fifty one from\nVegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made the international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is\nSide of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continue now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played a\nA a group from Ashville North Carolina green room [laughter]\nYou know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting declare an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence and joins\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there can be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does of Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not no I mean it was broken\nBy the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars\nAnd also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of Nevada and a good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world\nLikely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics given that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security\nRequired let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified I've independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered that exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them\nNew so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic where it could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is uh advance space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking worm holes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there is one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with ... July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb\nAnd they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at knell is air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space force\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua pie Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George you think that that is our co incidence of this stuff is lining up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and want to do in this huge Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "08"}
