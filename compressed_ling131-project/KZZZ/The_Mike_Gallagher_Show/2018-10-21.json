correction it's more like Ninety Ninety years [noise]\nAlso last night or should I say earlier this morning during the open lines segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife tonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time\nAfter death communication involving the great American magician escape artist Harry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears to bunkers of psychic ability mediums and his spiritual his movement in fact\nHoudini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he will do show that more than two years after\nHis death his wife best attended the sale is conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the great later however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the playoffs\nDespite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say odds on October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt\nHow did that friendship survive and the fact that Harry was such an and vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and\nI think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that\n[noise] ah discord between them that\nGot so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claimed that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of attention so anyway\nI was he sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow now part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coded method\nThat that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this is all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin that's how the trick would normally work when Harry invest first met and Eighteen Ninety four when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reach in their pocket political line what is the last two digits on the coin and they these were which\n... play answer say now hell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sentence like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best selling her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing them for ten but there have been doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please be quickly look easy quick\nUh and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry I Know\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after\nAnd uh we should back up and explain that on who Deanie deathbed in Detroit one of the last things he told doggedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contracted basses several years later correct by on Arthur Ford how did he hounded Ford get in touch with best\nWell I'll touch on that in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because that and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us to think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question I'm for it\nFord was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she really fun in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit was surviving gap and sort of got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nHe didn't want to say I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I got a jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and ... here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast am [noise]\nDon't let your dog it crashed stink or shed like crazy come to nine of us for help\nEight five night for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight when he I N o v I T E [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and uh the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas his website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas high Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there the the the medium would reached out to her\nA so so what happens\nHum Arthur Ford shows up and he Arthur Ford usually worked for the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they decoded them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just admit it the first I Want to explain that that's his nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched Bess and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of stuff [noise] someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this critical so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible\nThat they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other word\nAnd and again he just he he didn't of of forward through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't [noise]\nOf of forward through his spirit guide Fletcher does just that showed the word believe they used\nThis secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who was president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by her through forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in New York Times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so and in fact of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New Yorker graph or rack rather than your graphics and tell me about this reporter ... is it read Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but those are\nThe ones name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBats heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud it anyway and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this\nLetter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know\nUm and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sound and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward ten thousand dollar prize\nTo any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting too\nBecause you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted\nThe offer well that sounds you know pretty\nPretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress to be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but\nIt was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "21"}
