murder of a CIA station chief in his bowl as war against America a friend in San ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown the country now be used to be the jewel of the middle east isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with the Rand backing Hezbollah and who are these are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God is a Shiite religious militia\nUm\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leaders of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... the Iranians for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the salaries they send 'em intelligence specialists and they sent revolutionary guards and\nTo live in um with Syria's blessing and they said that they should live and on and they established almost a mini state within in many states that was very obvious to many in front of the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists the crime in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um family the the two people of the two groups that neglected is this a rifle and the amount of money in the amount of influence with uranium through spreading a rub it on\nOr the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFriend is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe U.S embassies in the hijackings in the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of put some history\nA this had never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nOr get in that story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran it\nThat story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Well Fred heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise]\nGeorgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nUh the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nA and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley here in just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz the book is called the roots rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred didn't Samuel would you be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break\nGive us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um\nThe has the forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power um Hezbollah has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties um the period we're afraid and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brands of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq\nIt was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there um I ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm into ... launched\nA um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege I'm way of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm\nI'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has it been for cells and operatives in this country\nHe's has for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through struck parties we worked with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting tough with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them well we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily some\nAre hostages were seized the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of the marine barracks\nWhich was um on the thirty five years ago to this day out on\nHold on for a second sand will come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book be rude rules next on the coast to coast they\nNever leave the detail of the show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast red Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules\nSam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated no I don't\nThink so I think um we haven't gone after you were on live harrowing because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the reigning you of groups like Hezbollah\nIn the Arabian use of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombings against the embassies the Marines\nAnd the kidnapping of\nA serious station chief from things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station chief from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Britain tell us about what you bought me\nA bill was a a a true patriot Georgia he uh [noise] grow up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and\nA thought about cashing them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills or family has a\nElderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh\nI'm In he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea as a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart um which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into now than it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a lot regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know didn't surprise me because of\nUh the nature of it as a curiosity and his language is and you know ... to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes into special forces are and um and it's also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was on the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and I'm Bill goes off or to Vietnam and\nWhere he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand so to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after the devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so um that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine war was a pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um his usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meets niches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day\nA in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are\nYeah these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around there [noise]\nIt's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period or it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt with an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was a you're a single ... or a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned a at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and these button Germany after he had been held in captivity\nAnd and he told his bill had died and that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because we had voted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in a haystack rental\nHome my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in\nBeirut while I'm which I'm not you\nCertainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak ambition wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's call them accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature as station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other age of he knew the names of their sources", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "24"}
