investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily\nAnd together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nBecause there's absolutely nothing going on right [laughter] I actually remember slow new gate news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nWhen was the last time we had a slow news day open lines in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the ... time\nSpeed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions\nI'm he does want stability he does want in the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nLet's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economics is also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later this and the camps to weaken China significantly economically so that they can achieve military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarter a but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says while we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so\nAre there hopefully gonna meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and it just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nAnd it's a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other a component to this Islamic terrorism perhaps an ... in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nA bed me is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still messages of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nI'm voting for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to know what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint a the wife says what Hollywood is viewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so\nHe you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know the he has adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\n... this past march now they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as a child\nAnd some going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well [noise]\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliance of evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political Korean predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um\nCovert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out of our lives and they they like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nAnd in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers

and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard it's Russia given\nTheir provocations but also a military capability which they're not shy to exercise and around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operations I'm rich and\nHave said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting enough militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations\nIn justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference from the twenty sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen Mitt terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose from there you know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that I gave him if there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA if not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities yeah literally across the globe you know they'll say Russia is more dangerous or China certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is why they're GDP about the size of Texas yeah why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says you know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even\nThat was you know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to\nA vet to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nAh twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts of indicators\nThat demonstrate that these two nations are\nPushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening\nOr certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony in border we want to go to war maybe World War three over a stone yeah\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know\nTrying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked or\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nUh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't back out on NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe ... midterm elections are there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious\nSeriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are extra you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect that the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips in these devices that can turn\nOn and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "20"}
