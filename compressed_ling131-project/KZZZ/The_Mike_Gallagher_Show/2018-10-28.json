the\nThe literal belief in it in every word being absolutely infallible I'm not there but I'm also not to the place where you are saying it's a load I mean how how how while say that\nI I Believe that there's there's a creator some time but I don't believe that what's written in the Bible is is what is true and I and I would I Would based that on if if God way back when when God delivered\nA you know the Bible or the words that we're supposed to live by you know a part of why would he only deliver it to one people\nTo be able to you\nFor it to one people to be able to you know give it throughout humanity\nI don't know um I Do with God we're all\nKnowing you know that humans were corrupt and you know that humans would use them against other people\nFor their own good\nGod we're all knowing law in that case looks sure sure yeah let's try this out on you okay challenger Little Syria [laughter]\nIf God came down George Burns like or otherwise tomorrow or let's say even a God that was more impressive than George Burns really look on line ... went on the air with Dan Rather and gave his message to the world tomorrow night\nOh yeah uh-huh I'm In the American people were polled after Dan Rather is interview with God mhm oh what do you figure the pool would turn out you know what was the God wasn't a God is real is it not real probably about fifty fifty something like that\nOr how fast I I Am best\nAccording to a everything I've read about the Bible and if\n[noise] and according to what what what you are given as far as information about\nThe different things from richer hold one on such things like that yes I just find it very\nVery difficult to believe that if God worked delivering a message weather pay that Dan Rather or or ... or whoever it may be you know that he wouldn't deliver it on to like all the people because capital or even Catholics are Christians say that you need to be safe\nAnd let's look look let's not some fun with this let's say you were

greatest family ah put the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you know that haunted feeling of getting lost in a field like the UFO er\nCrashed in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom with like state park ah which again has a mystery at the bottom with and and\nIt is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed\nUp and they feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know\nIt's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up them in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position will be teaching the Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to do good Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to get to the Roswell before we come back up against\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the ... on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take\nYou to the exact locations of the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take you out to the crash site where a knack for themselves rent a house is still\nKind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of\nA local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum\nUh the locals know who the tourists are because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great store I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two\nAmazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with\nOur police officers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and they'll hear the story of you know\nPeople might be quick picture with an arm their hair the story of our ... our and our ... and uh you know people really\nCome here searching for the truth and revoke or we\nWe don't want to say one way or the ... we want them to figure it out for themselves and you're very very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size where we're at town about forty thousand on especially on the ... anniversary of the best of all I'm you know we hit close to ... our our eyes on average per year for Korean family you're a little over two hundred\nAnd thirty thousand ... ... ... and her\nParty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until uh bringing our next guest next but thank you Anita and if I'm if I'm driving through time and get a chance of say hello okay yes prepare things where\nThe ... to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you write sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic aside\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary plays in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\n[noise] yeah that's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month and a quarter million so the massive amount of people that small city to have that its borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in shame on the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that said I wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for crowd America you\nKnow the victim was in Connecticut and in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yeah injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep it alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is and it's honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being people are being asked you for being which is going to the strange thing about that to me of course is that all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem in Salem at Halloween\nWay that might result started coming for it kinda barbaric ... skate punk rock that works beautifully\nOn a Richard astro here we're talking about the power waking up your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fiercest powers to he'll visit C.\nA. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just tend to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more\nVaguely two thousand eleven Largo Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims\nInterrupted a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt lincolnshire England\nA lung go turned ... incident in which ten people were hang in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but a Salem that sticks out\nAnd so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\nOh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons\nWhy kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held onto it over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell and and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know where these don't go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now he got through and I think to sort of that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver's was at the time to film village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim but with trials I mean the actual which has lived there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since then it was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a the terminal which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today at twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important and I this is great distinction can't\nHelp but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder and they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry kind of build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably through century that a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy this kind of underneath the underneath or Fort Worth so to speak then part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty eighth team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute ... [laughter] really is so they they don't\nCelebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found that Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um your talk again hundred thousand people packed to the small down kind of the city for failing to the city but don't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars washed the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same city did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts that many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right boots as a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so you you mentioned haunted happening but I mean the Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch ... are there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims\nYou have monsters cause of the film which trial then just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and ... and ... and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours their spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time all the time they're two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that as more of the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nLet's let's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trainer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have kind of thought you were around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of of apology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there's somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there an attempt to for him to do like bumped to say on or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there the original police that station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know escape\nHas a PR move for his next big event so that it wasn't down there do in order to stay on the bus thing but doing as a as a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who does these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into this\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the sound of the city in complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the witches and the winters have this really strange position where they call them some of which is ... and you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "28"}
