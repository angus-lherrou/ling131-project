something sent to them between four thirty five in the morning what is wrong with the way you sending us or early next just occurred to me why that's when he's got nothing to do so because this is not three in the morning you could be words\nAll right let's go to Linda and Linda you have a Nineteen eighty six the Corvette and this just isn't an ordinary\nRecord but now is Linda this is what you call a gorgeous Corvette\nCinnamon colored with gold flak carrier new paint job and I am put in a seven thousand dollar new engine about five years ago but it isn't and Mike rides about eight years\nOh my I had an [noise]\nAnd [noise] we who after putting my drier event and it put it into the event into the garage and now that's correct it but my aunt I drive my aunt type a lock brakes are law\n... even a shift or you can't move and\nAnd I just turned sixty five today and I drove Corvettes on my life and you're never too old to drive\nFast right you're right and to pick up on and on top of it [laughter] that was\nThere was some kind of electrical problem with the evidence I bought it\nUm if it didn't fire it up every two weeks ago that is not the man you know string them some guys trying what they know that they'll fire it up like um I Know it you have to do it overnight\nAnd wait and tell them inside lights on during the what\nTurned on then turned over but they've got you know I'm a woman I don't know what I'm Talking about\nAll right first of all Linda first of all happy birthday and secondly now let's talk about the core of that first of all what I'm going to recommend\nA will not answer your question right this second but what I'm going to recommend so you don't have continual problems is to get a trickle charger you need to have a trickle charger on your Corvette because if you let it set for two weeks or longer a it is natural for the batteries are good battery to go dead\nOr you take a brand new battery and keep on making it go dead and having to recharge and all the time from it's from a dead state\nIn about ten or twelve step a jumpstart or charges you're probably going to kill that brand new battery so let's let's go out and spend thirty forty dollars for a trickle charger it's all one AM charger and you're leaving on all the time it's got a brain and it it won't overcharged the battery it'll keep the battery living\nOkay then the other issue to you mentioned it was ... in the garage for eight years and in my concern maybe not necessarily that you can't get it out a gear\nUh and move it as much as maybe because of the extra humidity in the garage and no way to vent that the you have a four wheel disc break vehicle that the brake pads or actually rusted in seas to the rovers\nAnd that is an issue even though you may think it's part of the ships are probably not going anywhere and if you start to current try to move it it doesn't move\nBecause the brakes are frozen so sometimes what you may need to do someone would have to get another vehicle you would probably would have to take an hook a chain to the bottom of the suspension or frame and just ... and pulled it to break that free because they literally can you a metallic break lining was ... metal and they will season rush together so that's\nAnother we don't think you're having a problem with anything other than the seizure of the brake pads through the rotors and once you break that lose um it'll be fine but you're going to you're going to have the first few stops are going to be really really rough and then there after you'll be fine\nTow truck\nWell or it doesn't have to be a tow truck it could be a tow truck they won't lifted you don't want to have your Corvette toad certainly unless it's a flat bed all all you want to do is put a little chain with another car or something on it's just a nudge it\nYou could do that by um you know maybe just accelerating but were afraid that in the very dangerous situation so that's why we're suggesting going ahead and putting a chain onto the frame\nOr in just ... but you're not pulling it real hard or anything you're just getting it to move maybe a foot and of course you want to make sure it's a neutral while you do this deployed\nDoes that make sense to you Linda hello yeah I don't have\nIt all come out of power I Can't get a girl\nWell that's the other is she still with us for Roger was speaking about the the battery being fully charged or a different battery and you need that twelve volt voltage\nFully charged or a different battery and you need that twelve volt voltage there to release the inter locks on the shift her unit you and you mentioned the condensation from the drier and that also you're probably going to have the Russian condensation that is why the brakes are probably going to be seized to it's going to be rushing to things you have the rest of the issue and\nYou have the batteries you and if you're the battery issue and the breaks as we said you're going to be free and clear and probably are able to enjoy that vet just the way you should Oh thank you don't mind I enjoy and happy birthday on half birthday had a great day thank you very\nVery good you don't want that that college later oh let's go see what it's our time like we go to a Michael here\nMichael has an old age Saturn and Michael how many miles on your Saturn\nIt's true I Do have an Saturn [laughter] it just turned fifty one those\nFifty one but you have a front in noisy your ... I\nI think I Do I ... it's when you go over one of our great Michigan Road um and it doesn't have to be pothole filled just a rough man or a black um it sounds like I've got to rattle in the front end\nOkay yet on the go ahead\nWell keep in mind I'm used to eight Ninety nine so this little buggy is a lot different than what I've been\nDriving ... you've got to view yeah OK in in when you hear this noise you said he comes from the front you know if it's the right front or the ...\nI Believe it's the right passenger\nAnd does it when you're do you actually have to be hitting a small bump for this rattling noise to happen or does he had just do it\nYes no or some kind of a bumper imperfection and the road\nAnd it has you know you're sure it has nothing to do with the break so you're thinking suspension\nYeah the brakes were done a four thousand miles\nOkay and uh have you ever had the structure shocks replaced\nNegative never had this thing up in the air I've had it like almost a month\nOkay Mike what probably wrong you have ... they're called sway bar links okay it's a bar that's going to go from the front sway bar to the struck okay and believe it or not to check on\nA normal you can take a bar and move it around but in this case you literally have to disconnect one hand and then you have to check for free play it's going to be like a ball and socket and I'll guarantee you it's just way bar link fence that failed okay real common\nOne other question what I've had this this would open and the accelerator pushed I have never seen a motor move so much\nYou know it's very common ... and ... and in fact you know you could take and have the hook up and put it in ... Iraq and back and forth it's going to move it has to normal situation that's a good thing\nOkay one other thing a lot of week after week you guys are over my head with some of this information but what is guaranteed is a great you guys are\nFantastic nice very nice of you to say we do things stand I really appreciate that say All right now we are no good luck on that side effects\nHere yeah it's good to be known for the last well it's you know and this but he's in age with what we do and the cost of fixing repairs and all this stuff you have to go through it is good to be able to leave to have a little laugh\nAt their expense and of course I don't have I don't have communication with the control room let Angela no do not charges credit card ... we've got to this is a freebie it's a

we went by the lines and in a crowd so proud of the breaks a brand new truck anyways uh\nWe had a great point in the front all so we had a leak so uh we uh we decided to face all brake lines and I had no pedal let everything\nSo being ... tree mechanics that we are we a place to master saw no I have no rights do warnings is not telling a thing as something's wrong with the bridge yeah a sort of place to master\nLet everything down I have fell onto the floor and I have some break\nI Want to like a little bit kitchen in for on the floor if I back it up in the brakes like old school or just for a the brakes hit but it's like a kitchen and it starts pumping\nOkay now that's the problem I don't have after relax just not pump and I have we have all going almost so youre\nLooking let's start we have to start with a paddle first of all okay do you have four wheel just breaks\nI have a a drone sort of a\nRunning back okay and you do have now there's this is four wheel drive right and you do have abs\nRight and it's ... it's a heavy duty uh that's where I have a lot of problem okay hearts read this heavy duty right right\nHere's here's what you got to take a look at in the service bay area if this was in the shop they have a way that they can turn the abs pomp on an act of ... what it sounds like is that you have air that is trapped in the abs control unit\nThen is why you don't have any break pedals and if you even tried to break\nA or bleed at the at the abs pump itself it's very difficult because in order for the air to to dislodge out of the pomp\nYou have to have a way to activate the selling the lights and that's done you're going to this this way you're going to most likely going to have to take it to a shop a shop that has a scam tool that's going to be able to turn on the abs bumped in order to get rid of the air and properly bleeds system\nAnd that's your problem and you have air entrapment\nSo I can blame regarded help\nMe well I I was I was like I have a claim Roger so you know usually works to help shape\nNow you know what you could do by chance to make it better than you can drive it from point a to point B you could actually loose and some of the lines get someone in at the same process inside the vehicle and instead of pumping the pedal what you're gonna want to do is crack a line at the ATF controller\nAnd then having push on the pedal tighten the line up and go go to all these lines around her and that may get some of it out and they're All right then good luck on that and proceed call David or we have to take a break you were in a

a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done\nAnd I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back an attorney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well you don't have any listen missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening and\nIt's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nSaid no we don't have any less so\nYears ago somebody said well maybe you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list [laughter] of course they would but as it happened\nThey came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my\nAuthors status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such thing qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the list and want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting less from their entire system because we still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll sit right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards at every parking every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you\nNobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exam um\nYou know it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on there that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh the night we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue they can't I Can't find a scent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the farm team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd\nProbably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be and there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle\nAsian where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granite play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world to Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anymore in the world but ... much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends or your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them that point of separation something happens\nAnd that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is it this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical clustering that I figured out after I started putting Ken's in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and its men women there's four to one ratio correct\nI any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors and out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I\nGuess\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific ages and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles make us into the break we'll be right back\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue parameters\nBecause that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the report that they generate and the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports that name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled the v\nAnd a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased they're released the report most times times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal\nUh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you send me\nThat these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the polls look upon across\nColorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that uh you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specifics you're the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you'd you'd never heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the old story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird do explain\nKnow makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have an a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know don't want to have to answer tough questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the frontline people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office helped on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha ... what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in ...\nCame from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle she'd like to go to this a location a call ... ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet in elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean Puerto Suzanne\nRound trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot gained going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and\nThe mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him he reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went out and look for her\nWhile the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her up the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually called the snow homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of experts a pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual that cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because\nYou're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance with his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and search and day and night well actually I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kinda gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports\nOtherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before\nThat a lot of instances that may turn some results because people are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they said that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated\nNow this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is is what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and you you don't understand is George is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them\nBut the national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS than national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "01"}
