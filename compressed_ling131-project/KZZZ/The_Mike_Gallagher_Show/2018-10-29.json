thousand alright and you've got a a cooling flushing question for us today\nI went to find out a lot of garages not believe that you only green right here in in a cooling OK okay is that the right way of doing it with the old fashioned way of flushing it up\nThere's two different ways of doing it in your case you have a vehicle that's a ... six years old now and eighty thousand not a bunch of miles but they do recommend every five years or a hundred and fifty thousand miles\nMost shops will have a test strip 'em like uh like you're going to test swimming pool water that'll show the acidity of the ...\nAnd that's up to their discretion if it comes down to the point where it's good meaning below the aesthetic levels\nA lot of them would just like to do the drain and fill you know they're drained radiant her as much as they can and then they'll put the appropriate mixed back in but if the ... level is higher\nThan they will do it it's not really I Want to call it a flush it is but it's more of an exchange of anything work pushes out the old and polls in the new uh the only exception to that too is what they'll do individually when they do a flushes they'll use a different different type of above flushing procedure to do the heater core\nBut the key here is checking to see what a city the levels that you already have in the court so\nYou are the only exception to that too is what they'll do individually when they do a flushes they'll use a different different type of ah flushing procedure to do the heater core but the key here is checking to see what a city the levels that you already have in the ... so you know that's\nYou know if you've if you'd prefer to have done that way you know a a true flush uh entails removing the thermostat so you're going to pay a lot more money doing it that way and some people would rather say you know I don't want to do it let's just say at least to the exchange but it's all based on what they see what's what's the test strips\nNo they told me that that is if you give a ... and ... and then you might have\nReal no no that's that's not correct I mean you ... anybody any ... any professional what they should tell your number one is you know they'll check at first you know eighty thousand miles you know the the recommendation is five years or a hundred and fifty thousand miles should do it\nBut that doesn't necessarily until a total flush it depends on the vehicle and how the vehicle was a cared for\nAnd if you have you know that would be like saying uh you know it's the ... year old much can flush the complete system it's not required it's not necessary so I Would not say you have any residue or any contaminants in the system if you take test strips and check out that the the systems at a hundred percent then you can just do a drain and fill\nAll right through very good Joe thanks for the call let's go now to John John has a a Ninety seven forty explorer John how many miles on your Ford\nAh only have three hundred and six thousand\n[laughter] good for you but the city you're calling about a slipping clutch\nYeah this thing and then I just got this clutch re done because you know it was toast they looked at it was bad but [noise] so I had it for a while\nHad parked in a not a steep driveway but a decent size you know a little Anglo driveway I don't have a a I don't have a functional parking brake and the first thing one and they ask you in that case are you supposed to lead the vehicle and reverse or in a different here if you are\nEither first or reverse and naturally if you're on an incline you have the wheels turn to like if you can back into a curb a had a few started off with a ... you have a brand new collection the vehicle now\nYeah I just got it in a ... okay weeks\nAgo yeah your great reverse or first gear always because if you keep it in a higher gear yes it can roll\nOkay now this is the problem now now the vehicle is rolling on me\nIt's like it it's like it's losing its grip it's I think it's correct losing its grip and it just happened that day or so ago right okay and the vehicle drives fine on the road I get good grip everything else like that what could this things\nWell here's what you need to do put it on a level surface right place the vehicle and first gear okay or second your choice make sure the key is out of the ignition you don't want you to rock the vehicle back and forth and see if you can get it to move\nOkay now if you say it's slipping slipping slipping it's due to the fact that you may be on a very steep incline and that's not probably uncommon for that to happen because of the weight of the vehicle if it's more than Fifteen degree the incline your best to have that parking brake replaced or make sure you have a couple of we'll show us trucks with you to keep on hand\nOkay because it just started happening\nYeah do that as a task then then you'll know okay and if the if the vehicle does move when he gets vendors are good possibility that maybe the pressure plate failed the pressure plates today on that vehicle are going to head they're going to be a diaphragm type pressure plate where it's going to have will say like twenty five little fingers\nRight there in groups there's maybe three or four plates that are that are like riveted together to go around\nIf one of the plates gave way even though it's brand new it still can break then\nThat ... what does that mean that they replace the pressure plate or well\nWell I don't know what you paid for you know you should have had\nPaying about seven hundred dollars\nYeah you should have had a disk you should have had the pressure plate or I don't know if they reach surface to fly will for years sometimes are going to recommend replacing the hydraulic a slave cylinder which is\nPart of it that they said that that was a problem so I got a brand new ... uh what they call it swayed so yes I got that replaced also\nOkay yeah but that can do this for a test first any vehicle that has a manual transmission should have an operational parking brake yeah so [laughter]\nI don't have that but you were you taught me to do is to the park and ordered and first we're\nScared yep and then rock the vehicle if you can push the vehicle without you know make sure the keys out of the ignition right right and if you have a hard time moving it then we know for a fact that it's it's not the clutch hitting the incline is younger than you have this moves there's an issue there\nSo that's not unusual for this thing on an incline\nOh no oh no no let me ask you how much how much would it cost for him to get the the parking brake fixed I mean we all do\nHow much would it costs for him to get the parking\nI mean we all do dance normally used to what happens on the vehicles that the real breaks shoes themselves the patch or talks if you want to call it that looked separate from\nThe shoes so you've got to cost the shoes but sadly enough that older the vehicle he'll probably end up spending quite a bit of money left probably replace both parking brake cables all the hardware all the points and then issues it may cost up to let's say three hundred dollars or something you can do themselves as he is good and I'm\nNot really okay especially if it's been awhile since you had a real breaks put on a road is going to be seized and spend all\nIt it may take all the time All right Okay John appreciate the great Dane thanks for calling it you're on the car show let's go now to a ... and how high the two thousand Volkswagen Jana how how many miles on your gender\n\nOr six miles very good and uh so yeah I Love that conversion the or the car as electrical problem what's going on\nI Know a pretty\n[noise] sure\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOkay All right [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI I actually I shall I say well here's what's [noise] sure [noise]\nRight you're going to run out of time so what you need to do it's definitely still in that area the wiggle test does not really that good at the fires are already broken\nIn your case if the mirrors aren't working in there are other components not working and then you do have some wires that are broken in that area so what you need to do is look at that rubber conduit between the door in the door closed\nA if it's a difficult difficult one to get at sometimes you have to take a single ex razor blade and slice it for inspection\nBut you you will definitely find one or two broken wires it's not an uncommon problem for that to happen on your vehicle so forget the wiggle right broken once again is she right right right it's a sobering broken or if it's not working it's confined to the door and then it's definitely broken waters alright do very good our going to take a break\nWhen we

the ants auto parts want to remind you not so much you 'cause you're really on top of it that day you know you need to replace break hardware with every break job in a break jobs more than just replacing shoes and pads\nBreak hardware is all the supporting components as well so when you're looking to do the right job look to wherever quality break hardware for the certified fitting

or to monitor the price thirty to sixty I get a a like a ... [noise]\nI get a a like a myth [noise]\nStumbled does it something that continues or is it like your ... or ... or\nLike I had to fly yeah go almost like a tort converter clutch slip and I put some uh you know a additive in for that problem I replace the road or in the camp\nAnd I check the uh a slap in the shaft on the distributor what\nUh what about the plugs in the wires\n[noise] that's a problem there I haven't uh uh the cap was a pretty well uh you know sure and the thing is under under load there's no problem underwater\nYeah normally there wouldn't be what happens keep in mind that your mission wires are not what we think they are you know people think it's a solid core wire but in reality it's a carbon track this rapid fiberglass and of course you have a silicone jacket and always remember that electricity as lazy it's going to take the shortest possible route to round\nSo when you're at the at cruising speed what could be happening is that you have one plus Parkland wire that may be firing occasionally into the other one creating this so\nThat the problem because uh whoever owns it previously they tire rap riders made them real neat yeah I'm Wondering if I got a crossfire there\nYeah possible but what you want to look at in many cases ignition wires will have a don't date code or a year manufacture you've got a vehicle right now that's you know over Twenty years old so I Would say if you're uncertain how old the ignition wires are normally they should be replaced every five or six years\nI Would start with ignition wires if you don't want to do the plugs you know that's fine but again it everything plays hand in hand so in this case do the wires do the plugs and take care of your drive ability problem\nAll right through there you go jak for the call we're going to take a break but when we come back we're going to talk to a ...

[laughter]\nI don't think you'll want to go live right there which state would you like which one is the least medicated wouldn't be you know do I see the Medicaid I don't want the medicated one\nLet's move now let's go to Joe and Joe has a Ninety nine mercury traits or Joe how many miles on the tracer\nHired a thousand plus over\nA hundred thousand dollars alright and you've got a uh a lot of hours ... hours I said a hundred thousand plus dollars on what is it out there and I'm always thinking money\nI got a thousand miles plus\nAnd a we know he's got a little a code that was red for you here so tell us how the vehicles been operating and we'll go from there\nThe vehicles are good um my girlfriend's car and a light came on a couple of days ago\nI disconnected the battery for five minutes late run out ran it for Fifteen twenty minutes state or shut off the vehicle restarted like came out and again had the codes that came up with that a cold\nOr for a neutral safety switch but it's dark and everything so I don't know that\nOkay well first of all Joe let's back up a little bit here did some really good work because we know it's a hard cold failure because if the coach didn't come back that would be called the ghost or soft code which we don't fix goes through soft codes so now that it came back and its appeal a seven oh five which really indicates that the park\nReverse neutral Dr lo us which is bad or gory pattern going out of adjustment so that's all good so you did a really good job of telling us what it is now what do we do Dan\nWell even though yes it is a neutral safety switch so it will only stark and start in Parker neutral what we have is we have a device that lets the computer now if you're in drive if you're in second gear or you're in low\nSo what's happening here is it the computers looking at it and seeing that\nIt may be driving the car neutral or write or or yes it could be if you would have a piece of equipment on it where you're actually looking at the data that comes out when you're in park reverse neutral drive\nOr if you would have a scandal on it when you are and drive it may show that you are still in partially into neutral it's not a not a fold connect at that point so that is why the check injure light's coming on so what you need to do is replace that switch\nAnd whoever replaces the switch for you it's a little bit more involved than than will say I do it yourself job because of the fact that it has to be exactly or I should say centered into the position that you need so you don't end up at the same problem again\nSo Joe what you would tell your girlfriend is a fess up to the\nProblem and I haven't solved because what will happen eventually it if it doesn't happen sooner rather than later is the computer's just going to fail a and I don't mean the computer itself failed but the computer's gonna read thing\nThe problem and I haven't solved because what will happen eventually it if it doesn't happen sooner rather than later is the computer's just going to fail a and I don't mean the computer itself failed the computer's gonna read things that are not there in and there's going to be some crazy stuff happening right and wrong right could affect\nFuel economy and so forth so yeah All right Joe very good pre sheet to your call here on the car show now I Know normally ... normally we don't deal with ghost\nCoast [noise] it is kind of to Halloween season [noise] maybe because of how we could we\nRose codes and maybe we can have a ...

All right and it's usually in this shift point between a second or third\nBetween thirty and forty mile an hour that's the problem but as soon as it starts to warm up and when I say starts to warm up probably when the and starts moving up after joining a hundred and thirty degrees and it's it's almost like I'm getting a some kind of a ...\nYeah and it just you know it it does all the fucking I shot no lights there's no light spin that up\nBut I can press tried on it it's got good acceleration I can drive down the road at fifty five I don't have a problem it's just in that area you know when I put some Lucas transmission\nUh\nWe had to ... and stuff in it and uh that helps a little bit but uh but I I'm just curious\nOkay well you have one of a couple of problems first of all why that speed it's because it's probably in the whole cycle of driving\nThat is the heaviest load or with the latest condition if you will and so you're going to notice any miss fires or anything like if you had a transmission a I'm a ... uh the clutches inside the automatic transmission that are slipping you'll notice that too now so you have one of two problems I'm going to head on\nMaybe we have an electrical problem more than in right in what size engine do you have a new GMC a five point seven okay and it was a full size let's go back a little bit too hot what did you do have you on this truck for a while where you know the maintenance is up to where it needs to be\nUm I voted that said they had a hundred and twenty\nThousand on it you know typical things that we want to take a look at it if you haven't done it yet is you know replacement\nOf ignition wires distributor cap rotor spark plugs even if you have worn out spark plugs in has what we call ... that can create a missed fire under low like experience and so let's do the preventative maintenance do the plugs do the wires do the ...\nAnd then re evaluating Dr ability concern [noise]\nAll right very good Carol thanks for the

Steve's credit card [laughter]\nHey Steve did you give us a critical about it or just for gas and not a problem you know I just loaded a tanker truck what's the deal I wanted to have some extra around All right\nWell it's okay because I got a lot of points when you did it no no never mind let's go to David David as an oath seven forty tunnel line eat one fifty and David how many miles on that kind of line van\nHotter Ninety seven thousand alright coming up a two hundred thousand and today you're calling about your timing change\nYeah I might a mechanic told me and I heard\nEvery once in a while when I got it up like clicking like it sounds like changed the slap yeah they found the up and he said that means that sounds like you're timing she started ... well yeah yes and no\nWe're wandering around I don't want to break down into that really need it for the next six weeks\nI Wonder if I should take it in and just do it\nHave it done or well\nHere's here's the issue you you won't breakdown if anything it'll get noisier that's issue number one out in the hundred and Ninety seven thousand miles I mean you have to be doing something right to go that far along how often how often was oil changed\nFor five thousand six thousand at the most\nOkay so you put a lot of miles on in the years and basically is what it comes down to what happens is you have items on the recall cam phase ers and you have chain guides and then you have these campaigns are nothing more than a than hydraulic\nA extra waiters at will tightened the chain and you have a ... valve timing engines so what's happening is these phase or moving back and forth\nAnd ... it's adjusting timing according to load show the issue here is\nIf you're at the beginning stage you're at the beginning stage of of yes maybe having the ... and the chains replaced because it changed your probably stretching and the guys are wearing but I Would I Would try out and be a little bit conservative even though you change the oil at the time you can use\nAnd an additive an oil additive that sometimes we'll take and help these camp favors loosen up a little bit odd and do that along with an oil change a and by doing that with an oil change and I don't know\nIt right now with the oil you use you should maybe start considering using an oil if you don't do it now a high mileage type oil which will have all the proper ingredients for additives and everything that you need\nYou know four engines with more miles so you may use\nYou know you could use this product or possibly even like motor coach you can go to their site motor coach dot com and use their product and in the first time around you used to ounces per\nA court and let's let's have a little bit of chemistry do its job first before we start spending maybe twelve or Fifteen hundred dollars for the placement of the change\nRight I like good advice I'll take into consideration [laughter]\nI ... for four or five well yeah well no you're fine

just maybe it's a time when those other worlds dribble over in two hours\nWe're going to talk about that idea tonight with two very sharp mine's gas to been thinking about these questions and subjects on a higher plane than most of us\nYou know we talk about other dimensions parallel realities on this program all the time about beings from other worlds about inter dimensional time travelers dimensional portals we all kind of take it for granted sometimes that all those ideas are real or at least we think we understand that\nWasn't always that way for people do how do we get to this point and what does it mean for us if there are other dimensions does it mean there are people in those other places and if so can they get here or maybe they're us\nThese are heavy topics but we have a great gas to help us get our heads around them Christopher white earned a PHD in religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions\nWhich takes a look at how our understanding of the world around us and unseen worlds such as the future or heaven or other dimensions\nHad the ball or how it reconcile science

being that are in different forms are seen through a different culture in prison where you can do on that\nWell yeah I mean I I'm a big um for the follower of of junk tales were particularly and I think one of the things for me at least\nI mean you know different people get difference in our responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of type the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation ... conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be multi connected if you like interconnected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big ... creatures on in the same location and timeframe\nA site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia in the sixties um when there was ... when they ... from the same soaring around the\nThe skies both both point pleasant heels shut a lot of encounters with the men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that I think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology ... or ... I'm not entirely sure that they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the weirdest side of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got movement going man oh we're ... we're cat she chapters are a lot of differences between the creatures that are seen an awful lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that same have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nUm I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally\nShape shifty like in America have over in London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that it's\nThe the locations where these dog man type creatures said is intriguing it very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing Bob and just said that random\nYou had one now where we'll need that was from a military base not each either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle Roy Laffer was helped them break and uh I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\nThat to an American guy but it's working I'm overseas at our EFL come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presence there she was a high to the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this
