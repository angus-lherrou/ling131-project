to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state\nAnd every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow he's like a cubicle or a ... and ... declined or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus action like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flow chambers and jumped in this case you're not floating you're you're in\nThis is controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou hands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right no that's the idea you are isolated and they don't feel alone you have headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey friend who's been several times on wet leading nanny signal technology in the minority and when he truly hate hate yes\nThe idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora will be technologies been around for a long time and it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go I'm Sunni where would you and I knew that [laughter] ... you know it it kind of a formula right\nWell there's a yes there's relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression that are used but it's basically a meditative\nType of program that's guided often guided where you will just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate\nTheir own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for Russians mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say ... opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences a for instance\nPast life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nAnd to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what the question could you ask the town and then you write them down when you come out and then like right in Atlanta way\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be transmitted many different ways it's not necessary\nA transmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences\nAnd they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implications than personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then I mean in a way your experience you William have died in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my left means has been a guest on the show before she said that she has independents encountered\nSold that need help and I think that's fascinating counseled on that that that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well\nOr where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing\nDoes happen quite a bit and I'm at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines\nI'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others\nIn that um [noise] and to that shift say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so too and some in crossing over have you ever done this after a tragic incident and national tragic incident learn math is still you know one\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way of managing your having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its its functions in different names and different cultures\nInstitute we we presented in I think a more ah let's just say are very grounded in a scientific wave at least the scientific as we can that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical\nWay that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allow the person to have their own experience with that I Want to find out a little bit more on how one of the culture and does this and when it's cold and other\nCultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about when it comes to just exist and and also a little bit more on how you can you didn't on your own and it will adapt with my guest William booming I Am saying are you listening to customers and\nAgain dial pound to five zero and she is the key word free bottle\nThis online banks for closing on how they even had documents and I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a nightmare\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud\nYour whose title and mortgage are kept on line where the board and domestic act them it's simple they forge your title borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer I Know about title fraud sore register with home title walking discovered some they had already taken over title\nThank God I found out of time no bank identity theft program or a church protects you hope title luck will for pennies day oh title lock puts a barrier around your homes title in ... the interests\nHi luck puts a barrier around your home title and mortgage the in to ditch\nThe text tampering there on helping you shut it down find out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollars searched free which is at home title luck dot com home title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to ... am I only cigar and my guess William booming we talking about out of the tiny exploration and self and get out of money and\nNot to trauma that to an actual workshop huh it sounds fun regulated type ... out of body or Asians thing and it's also\nWell done very well and something that ... land for almost twenty you really don't think he can do on your own we live what are the culture has this existed in history\nOr Lisa from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the\nI'm a way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit\nIf you look back through all the biblical text all the transformational type of experiences people\nThere are there consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it's just that was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on it it goes all the way back to ancient Hindus a Buddhist text\nUm [noise] to every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can out of body and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that infinite number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake ending 'cause then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue\nWhere they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume there are human being because they were they found themselves in the human body mhm but in actuality a consciousness\nUh can take on any form\nI I Know from having out of body experiences encountering are all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a love\nLove pets six cetera during her out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience any new ones that have come sooner already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book were my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body and I also had a cat that would do that ...
