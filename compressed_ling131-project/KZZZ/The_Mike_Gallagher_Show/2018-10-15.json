W. dot Pamela Crabtree dot com\nThe talk show off your\nAll right let's get back to your calls let's go to Vicky\nVicky has a two thousand twelve nice\nVicky how many miles on your Nissan alright and you've got a question about getting ready for winter\nYeah I I I lost my mentor Tony everything and I need to find out what about the air and what about the current I have five twenty wait a while and\nAnd it's an addict kind of prep bike if I see where they're coming up we'll be traveling north much colder\nOkay I was gonna say you're from the grass city a Grass Valley area in California correct\nOr nothing at that and we have very mild weather but I'm going to Oregon\nOkay All right a few things first of all uh you don't put a lot of milder John it'll you know we have now is that going to change where you're going to put more mild John is just going to be pretty consistent\nProbably okay what I recommend for people and it's just easier to remember rather than mileage\nFor people and it's just easier to remember rather than mileage is change your oil with the seasons so in other words when the season turns change your oil that's an easy way to remember it\nIf you change oil too often it's not going to hurt a thing if you don't change that often have often enough then that's where the problems come and so yes I Would definitely change or with the seasons now as far as your cooling goes there's some rules for that\nToo right you have a vehicle that's coming up on six years\nAnd ah when you age at that point regardless of miles that things like the cooling system should be flushed new Cohen should be replaced\nBut we also change break fluid now it's also very important with abs systems electronics that are involved in selling knowledge\nThat we need to ... you don't have the break fluid exchanged and flushed out in the reason for that is because the brake fluid at high risk topic it it will actually absorbs moisture in moisture will damage a lot of the components inside of braking system\nOr other items that we change and basically it's gonna be all the fluids even though the miles aren't there you probably want to service your transmission you also want to take a look at the power steering on you know the inspections here we go again to you have a vehicle up on six years old even though the tires may have enough\nOr tread on them left what happens within time the heat a creates a problem where the tires will become very hard and greasy so you have a attraction problem there and that also attraction problem but even when you come to stop\nYou know the hardening of the rubber tires will create a problem with stopping to so basically it's if you do all this now you're going to be set for for quite a while before any sort another\nProbably at least three years before you have to really look at that but here's what I'd recommend Vicki\nGo to your local shop that you'd like to go to and tell them that you want all the maintenance done the things that we talked about\nIf if uh if financially that's a burden for you what I Would do is have them do it in tears have the first part of it done the oil changed transmission fluid and the coup and change and then you can do everything else waiter or as your budget allows but it this way you're staying ahead of it but\nHonestly you're going to go through a a big bill right now and then for about three years you'll not see much money's spent at all and the key what we're talking about now is not so much about winter rising your vehicle\nFor the trip to to Oregon it's more about the mileage where you are now and she was asking about the the weights uses five W taught him that's great and that you can continue doing that to absolutely\nSo you're actually Vicki you're doing really well it's just when you're not behind anything but what you're at where you're at is you're at that time where it's going to cost you a little bit money we call it the sixty or Ninety thousand mile um checkup and so you're at that point right now but\nOnce you do that then you're going to go like I said about three years before you have to spend much more money other than oil changes\nI have that crashed okay but they can't have a hard time here and it's just to have elderly yes okay I heard on the show at our health care than the average finance\nYeah there is in fact if you are requested whips filters they have a terrific uh on most applications a long life filter in other words you could go longer and it's a bigger a capacity filters so it can take more debris before it goes into a bypass mode again it switched filters W ... that's up to you\nYeah I mean if you're doing normal you\nKnow seasonal changes not a lot of ... really they're probably okay you don't have to worry about right and the only exception that I Would like to add to that if you were like in an area like in the east over here where we have a lot a lot of cold and whatever\nAnd you know that we recommend that even with short driving because of the condensation that'll forming a crank case in your case though\nYou know if the temperatures are always like in the sixties quite a bit in the states pretty moderate\nYou may get by with not maybe going by you know just just look at it maybe from the cold seasons you know maybe October to December then of course January on\nBecause that's where the compensation and the moisture never burns out but it's going back and forth yeah and it's easy to remember to do it with the seasons with my needed or not you're absolutely right here in St money that way but let's make it easy to remember just do it with the seasons\nAnd don't worry about the the oil field or that they give you 'cause you're not driving a lot of miles\nAnd you're changing in regular yeah what they asked for us if you were using a full synthetic oil and trying to get as long as you can on an oil change remain like thousands and we're ... and was talking to a year or that's when you go into those high capacity oil filters\nIf you're doing it the way we're suggesting to do it four times a year just put a normal oil filter on its plenty big to take care of those intervals between three thousand or three months\nGreat okay make it simple where you have that right\nYou know our number anytime we can help we can be your or we can be your advice\nThose troubles between three thousand or three months\n[noise] great okay make it simple you\nAll right well you know our number anytime we can help we can be your ah we can be your advisors\nThat's not All right take care of ... I have a great trip to the great state of Oregon [noise] All right let's go now to a guy Scott has a two thousand eleven Kee ah Scott how many miles on your key as\nA guy bottom line is six dollars an hour I enter your calling us about what\nA while I'm Still on the car which I Do just about every other day um when I turn on the show it up\nLike when I go back to start the car that's hard starting you know normally it's a very real stars right now it's hard to start when I get it started a doesn't want to do so I got a son or on the gas pedal for a little bit\nLike there are two and it starts fine the rest of the day so I run out of jail you know or filling up stop to throw it out\nAre gone as far as we are going to run and what are you know it's not a not a great plan but I'm also starts to idle funny wax seal it\nOK Scott you have any check engine or services your lights coming on\nAs one that came on yeah\nOkay well it sounds like Senate you have a problem with the mission control systems are users two or three major components that can create this problem\nSo we have a problem will say for example with the vet fell over the ... what's happening when you go to refuel the vehicle\nIs that when you are gassing adopters fumes that normally are stored within the evaporates and there's a canister of charcoal canister that will actually take and recover these films\nSo then after you're done filling up what happens is that you start your car and then very slowly this purge valve will operate and that will slowly burn the fumes always in and then of course there's less\nLess hydrocarbons that ended up in the atmosphere in fact we offered saying about almost ... also an action days you know not to fuel your car or you know specific temperature and whatever so what's happening is instead of the Steelers being held\nIn the special reservoir there going directly to your attention and then take math ... and when in reality what you're doing is it's running that way because the engines flooded out so\nNext step is you need to have someone to look and read to see what that service coach staged and it's not going to tell you exactly what's wrong it's going to lead you to the direction to repair in what circuits and uh once you make that repair that Dr ability issue or diminish or so away\nNow I gotta tell you it's got that you may have caused this problem if you're going to your fuel stops and maybe you get a a a good deal on fuel\nAnd so you tried to stuff as much of it is you can in the in the fuel tank\nYou need to stop after the first click and ask for every body um I I'm really I'm known for doing that I Try to get every penny a fuel and and I eventually or hurt myself or the systems in the vehicle so don't do that Scott and anyone else that's fueling vehicles don't do that\nI Do very good shape for the call\nI used to do that to do that anymore when it clicks on care where it is that's what I I used to see guys rocks their cars faster and more than a hundred and five an hour to get another set for a gallon and we are the car show\nLet's say you're a spotlight is brought to you by Walker products are leading manufacturer quality fuel system components an engine sensors these vehicles are being pushed to new heights with increased fuel economy and fewer tailpipe emissions\nEvery time I made a turn stall I'd have to start the car out and get going again\nOkay when when the ... you have ... on your instant panel correct yes when you start the vehicle up this is going to make up a way to go for diagnostics we need to know this odd cars in park he started\nThe engine rpm should go up to maybe eleven hundred twelve hundred and they should drop down to seven fifty or the the L K and then when you place it in drive or it should still stay at seven fifty you know if it ever drops below seven hundred and fifty\nYeah it'll it'll be at six fifty sometimes you know like in ... and just sitting there and neutral here maybe as I go to back up from kind of watch leave it on because it tells me right what you know what may happen has happened\nSo here's what you need to do you need to have the fuel system cleaned you're going to have to have the throttle body clean the mass Airflow censor ah upper induction system and if you do if you're around that mileage points where there's a hundred thousand miles on sparkling tortured and want to do is do this aggressive cleaning\nAnd then after the cleaning you're gonna wanna probably drive it for a week or so and have ... changed and so we don't want to do is you know replace Marc Lynch and contaminated with these\nThe way 'cause you haven't mentioned anything about a check engine light and uh you should watch though again you know a lot of people don't pay any attention to it but you should really you know when he started you watch it it goes up to twelve hundred should hang in there a little bit and slowly creep down in many cases\nYou may not even see that rpm change which is an indication that the throttle body and the fuel systems extremely dirty\nOkay I Do get a service steering system okay now\nHere we go again running at a low idle speed and if you're running at a low idols B that can create that problem too because he ... isn't that fast keep in mind that every time you make a turn\nThe power steering pressure switch kicks singer loading everything down you've got your air conditioning on you've got other components that put a load on the engine so what's the computer saying is that the engine rpm are too low so that service code may go away when you resolve the problem with the engine idle speed or you know running\nA at warm temperature in dry should always read about seven hundred seven hundred and fifty\nRight okay and someone says like the there's a switch and the steering system or something that needs to be replaced\nNow know that actually tells you that it's working because what it's doing is commanding it should be commanding the computer to increase anytime you put a load the attorney AC on the engine rpm should go up you turn the steering wheel the computer takes oh anytime there's an rpm drop it should increase it back up you have the uh is that what\nThey're talking about is a train students or or switch whatever you want to call it but if that were working then you'd you'd really know it and it would have happened all at once we think that it's a long term thing and now you're just at that point where now it's really critical and you need to get everything cleaned and bring it up to and after that it's all done one of the things that\nCome to mind too is you if you had the idol speak control motor that's no longer working a correctly\nOr that could be the cause of his too but you still want to have the cleaning done in as to cleaning stunned that will help the idol speed control motor work to write the notion often\nCalled like a major cleaning\nOr if his or her now fuel injection cleaning you know you can have um there's an induction system cleaning and the fuel system clean and you want both performed and what's often forgotten about on the on the back of your car's fuel filter up underneath make sure that's changed also\n... ... okay All right great very good thank you very much\nAlready to have a great day thanks for calling us here on the cars are going to take a break in a moment before we take the brake we've got James with us and oh three Ford Windstar a James you're having a problem with the drivers door electric window described the problem real quick before we take a break\nOut the window stopped growing\nA if a if I pushed it down and let it run up and order and then fight that happened a couple of times and it went\nDown\nRead or write anything\nYeah most likely the window motor has failed so you need to have the window lift motor replaced so a new window lift motor for that door yes and how much is that going to be all depends if he takes it somewhere probably about two hundred and fifty dollars\nThat will take care of the problem and you won't have to worry about fact with more calls in a moment\n\nOctober is full car care

Seventy fifth anniversary Nineteen thirty nine for coup die cast car\nAnd you can do with it as you please hang on a side note when was the great depression or you were born in ... to ... ... more than thirty\nNo us thirty nine thirty nine okay when was Russian yeah no they okay that's what I thought\nThe depression so yeah so you had a ... he brought here he brought in the Ford coup a and the depression as of ... where you are a very heavy stuff [laughter] All right so let's get back to why you called and that's about a a golf cart that seems to be doing a lot of smoking tell us what's going on\nFor ... or ... go ask a but it goes good church right away but it shrunken or that kind of additive like motor cooled or something in there to a machine for well over\nWell at this point we want to make sure that you don't have another problem first of all what color is the smoke\nA greater blue blue okay what's the oil here now how long have you owned a golf cart Twenty years okay how often did you change oil in the Gulf garden going through your okay normally here's what can happen if you have the wrong way to boil\nThat can create a problem with smoking is the crank cases over filled with oil now as you're a golf cart raised was at a lifted or anything or is it all stockstill\nNotice or above you\nOkay so it's raised so sometimes because of the way they're raised it changes the way you filled the cranky you may have an over filled crank case okay that'll create a problem uh I was going to go to the fact that if you didn't change oil all the time that he may have a piston rings that are stuck now that should be\nThat for cycle engine should still even have a PC ... if you have a plugged or restricted ... that can also create a burning problem but I Would be concerned about this or whatever I Would start\nIf you get your owner's manual would ever find out what the true capacity of the uh crank ... says okay\nRight drain it just drained it right out and then I Would use a straight thirty weight detergent oil okay\nHe's a straight way okay yeah oh yeah absolutely and and the reason why we're doing is we have to have a baseline let's start off to make sure the crank cases not over filled in all the I I Know too many people that have had their carts raised\nAnd believe it or not it changes the way you read the oil in in yeah they'll keep on putting oil as well it's not not enough not enough not enough but in reality the rover filling it so let's go back to the basics since you've told me you had it for Twenty years and you change oil a time I'm going to discount the fact of a plug PCB delve\nA I'm going to say the rings aren't worn a but there could be another problem too in between that and that's contaminated oil to pull the ... the oil level stack\nAnd see if there's an older fuel if you smell fuel than there is a corporation problem what's happening is feels leaking into the crank case it's it's diluting the oil and that's where you get the smoke also\nAlthough he got to really basic things again older\nDrain it make sure you go in the owner's manual figure out the exact capacity and use the thirty way to oil and then you naturally you're gonna have to run it a little bit\nUntil everything burns out of the selling their heads and of course the exhaust whatever ray and in and I know that and didn't recommend this right now but I Would and that is just put a new piece she developed and make sure it's the right one don't work for this [noise]\nIs it and it's it's right at the current case right now it's going to be an event at areas you're going to have a maybe a like a half inch or a rubber hose\nAnd it'll be into a valve\nValve cover area and what that does it's it's a vent awesome calibrated vacuum like right in what happens if it's ... the oil the oil will burn through the system but again let's let's all go back to the base lines and oil level voter ... valve and then you know to get you run it for a little bit and see what happens\nRe or we're going to put you on hold so we can get your information and\nAll right ray or we're going to put you on hold so we can get your information and just to be clear the great depression ended\nWell in Nineteen thirty nine ... his birthday bought in the end of the great depression and Brian was very limited start Ryan's Nineteen twenty nine yeah okay well ... to that's why I saw in the middle of the ... thirty nine thirty two but I said thirty two I mistakenly said thirty two because something happened to ... to okay\nNow we're born oh yeah [noise]\nSo did you is the difficult economic conditions okay I got this right so I look at Bryant yes and I go are you sure about that and they searched flagging toward the computer and I go well I guess if it's on the Internet it could be wrong and he goes history that whenever I\nGo to Brian again no more coffee for Roger the skin way too high for others were supposed to be entertaining and informative and I was trying to be in formative because they're not doing much of the\nOne eight hundred eight five nine zero nine Charles Yemen as I Would never tell you to be entertained okay no and that's a stretch let's go to Ken Ken has another seven ... how many miles on your rendezvous there Ken\nHas a hundred and twenty thousand\nRight tell us about the clock\nUh recently I had the transmission changed\nUh they said everything's okay there was no shavings you renting else to count for anything now ah I recently noticed that if I made a light with my foot on the brake and they had two or three cars in front of me I'm waiting for a left turn light\nA when I kick my foot off the break and try to accelerate I get a lake clunk\nIn there and I'm not sure that transmission or is it break or what\nYeah well it could be or either or a let me ask you about the clock when you take your foot off the break 'em and you hear this song do you feel anything within the vehicle itself\nIt feel a little bit yes\nOkay so you actually feel the clock where do you feel the clumps add if you if you could try to pinpoint it I Know it's difficult\nIt feels like it's in front\nOkay okay so here's what you need to do that and let's go back to the basics make sure the vehicles and you're not running he's out of the ignition you're going to have the hut raised and it may take you or another person you're going to want to take in rock the vehicle back and forth so you're going to want to listen to see if you can duplicate that noise\nAnd if you can there's a good possibility that he may have an engine mount or transmission mount that has broken okay that can create a clock like that where you can hear it and also feel it that that's going to be the starting point now the other issue could be and you mentioned that you had the transmission service\nWas it the first time you had the transmission service than all these miles or have you had a service in prior years\nI just free to purchase a car about four months ago and it's as far as I Know this might be the first time\nOkay so here's another issue inside that transmission we have little pistons that are called accumulate or as I call them shock absorber within the transmission\nThere could be a possibility that when you're accelerating the transmission isn't in gear and bike celebrating what you're doing is you're building up the hydraulic pressure and the transmission and it's pushing on on this accumulate around these pistons and then bam at its slams into gear so\n... what you may want to do is you can go to your friendly O'Reilly O'Reilly auto parts store and you can purchase a supplement an additive to add to that to try to try and help to solve some of the tarnished that has formed given about three to five hundred miles of driving but again\nThe first step is rock the vehicle see if you hear the clock enough not to add put the additive in a man\nYou have a three to five hundred miles\nAlright a very good Ken thanks for your call when we come back we've got a duck with the caddy we've got away with a\nMotor scooter we've got Kevin was a trailblazer your calls to one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five seven we are as the one the only the original we are in the car show [noise]\nListening to your spotlight is brought to you by Walker products a leading manufacturer of quality fuel system

exhaust after treatment system featuring an array of sensors designed to monitor and control the different aspects of vehicle operation and help me GT or exhaust gas temperature sensor plays a major role\nOr try and hold it at one set speed I Will watch the tack drop all the way down no matter what speed I'm going to drop down to his lowest six hundred and then it's got a rabbit stuff back up again\nOkay and if I'm completely off the pedal okay does not know when I have heard\nCase so here's a good possibility because of the miles on the vehicle and what you described you have a drive by wire vehicle in other words you don't have an accelerator cable you having a little electric motor that opens and closes throttle buddy\nYou have in a little electric motor that opens and closes throttle body\nThere's a great possibility in fact I'm almost positive that the ... going to be all carbon ... so what has to be done\nOn this Ronald body needs to be removed from the engine that's held on wood for bolts and if you're going to do this on yourself and do a cleaning you do not want to push on that plate you wanna thoroughly clean it\nFront side and backside you can use a brutal Riley auto parts buy yourself a nice ... body cleaner not pick up a nice soft a brush a so you don't scratch anything and just flush and wash all that out and then re install it and you're going to find out that this that doesn't eliminate it it's going to be about Ninety percent corrected\nOr other concern would be then to after you do this cleaning there is also what they call it a I'm going to call it a throttle body reached set up but that normally has to be done with someone that has a automotive scanned tool that can do that procedure but\nYou know go back to the basics let's do this cleaning first it's not going to cost you any more than the can of a robotic cleaner and of course the the brush to do the jobless\nRight very good for the call one eight hundred eight five nine\nZero

super chip dot com for more information All right let's go now to Roy\nRoy has a a I'm a little motor scooter to two thousand nine and what's going on with a motor scooter there Roy\nYeah it's a question of up to choke Scott electric choke and I got all the a carburetor stuff I mean air cleaner stuff off the back of it not rich and and it looks like a plunger and I'm Wondering if that's to choke\nYes it is okay now if if it's taught and if it's working right when you turn the key on should you should activate\nWell it's it's only when cranking is when you're going to see that move now how many wires how many wires go to that choke one two three a true I think\nTwo wires okay so what you're going to have that as you're going to have a habit to the point where it's set up now here before and let's go backwards again so I don't jump around too much can you move it freely with your finger up and down\nRight you can is that correct\nYeah I Do that and I can kick brought it but\nIt it starts starts installs all the time but if I'd reached like finger in our living right here it was\nOkay so what's happening then it's a selling like what you want to do is you're going to want to make sure that you have power going to get a ... meter and check to see if you have any any voltage it should be on that system should be twelve volts because it's a cell annoyed\nAnd if not if it does then that's indication that that is bad the components bad if you don't have power you're going to have to go back to the source and figure out why were to go why did you lose that power or

you're doing is you're you're forcing feel through it\nAnd then of course it's running so don't discount the fact that you have a carburetor problem too is the solid and working so don't get go don't

in a boat for this\nPlanet and every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nForty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north south east and west\nAnd it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain a sparrow any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt shouldn't history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that's just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I started a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock\nIf you're on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert ... a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing I'm with you a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those at length tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the papers section and everything was in the row a new was the first and so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing ah the the snakes and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved and all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors um I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and wanted to align them with a three belt starts off Iran they had to be some kind of records and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of humor when they looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I Am so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of the line that's on that are on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThat was a a so he was talking basically about the ... and this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the Puritans were built if there was this things then it ... it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the lying is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the and one of the use of my own general but you have the great pyramid the grades things uh two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything he loved to go didn't tell their story and not only that but taxes in an accounting and sees and everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nThat that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy on I mean being you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um [noise] the pyramids\nIt's called something at least the things I'm\nThe pyramids we um you know when you're on ... when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years to one or two years after a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that to them there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in\nIn the two of its called or the whole rise of ... next to it it's the um the you know there are offering it's great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they called back ... grade and ... was called to Hawaii of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct is that is declaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn your image you were to go back and like I said an owner's manual we don't have fought but there isn't even a general reference to to pointed in the direction and\nForget about the other something about how we build their bills or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it gives you all\nThe way to ... um you know fifth century we see now this was in doing portion rule um two thousand years after the fact and and it's a lot of his dividing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plot so and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years\nUm and we're machines that were falling off the blocks but you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe or the other part of this or that is just too confusing years Lugar each man you know we also have the same issues and if it was the the dream style a while and the inventory dollar we may not know anything at all\nLike yes the wall between still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author off to dream still up between the positive things that\nHe is the one building that was actually being debated um but uh and there is a there is a small reference to operate but it's it it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that you build it [noise]\nUm and so that's the dream select the inventory Steve all the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when ... when I ... I mean key ups I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name Cooper was the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo you mentor Steven says Bernie I'm perfectly with Google came to the plots all distinct already existed in fact it was broken he regarded and then he built his pyramid and that one and the pyramid of his queens I knew some\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leading off right now the coast to coast damn are murals to church or ... minute safe deciding and you all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\n\n\nCardio ... much peace of mind and your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars ... party a dot com K. A. R. D. I. S. dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I ... church it's the great pyramid all might be or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute say Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory tell and the dreams della right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and end the dreams della a top most the fourth\nSays mentions and and illustrates two things says there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ...\nA joke tweeted is there a second thinks well there's two things\nThere I Know there Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second being in\nThe sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... he is there a second things\nAnd it's a great question I'm Out of it so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the seconds things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's ... it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAs an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of the Nile but it's there it's things buried under the fans are that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\nDemon Tories della you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repairs is being but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most is your pauses do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert chocolate and I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so what's your question\nThey're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the ... the combination is pet him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of text where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and the the verb that that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even\nThe you know the fires of ... that was founded in ... in the red sea\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is the Paris Talks about tour store and being ... or ... or um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was\nBeing shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who I mean it was amazing interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up the courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their own mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives a pyramid was dealing with uh also one of the ... black so why would there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes yes there is a\nA reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh\nOffense to a hit Knutson 'em and hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is will the new to it so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah off the tree a green permits that are on an indie east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in human towards though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting just because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a prince says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think the poop shows that she was a princess\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why you should probably just reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an oath getting them story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS of aside as we're not yet a working worship there weren't not official states sanctions or the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the votes or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surrounding smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man with the same pair\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect them to be justice allegation is even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're ... don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well they I so the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nLet's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about his new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we had been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I like about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill holds you didn't have to you know like uh uh the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "15"}
