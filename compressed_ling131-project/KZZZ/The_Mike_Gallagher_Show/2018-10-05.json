I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand ... ... it's embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the rubber hand that they filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with liars and I'm\nSure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put it into this perspective of weight there this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something to make a ... this isn't something that just the torture me this is this is something\nFor fun and I think it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it ... ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror or is it an offshoot of fantasy in those ... I I like all of that I like a John or movies I like a you know monsters and\nThen the robots and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI I remember him taking me to see the Syrians when I was seven years old Mr ... oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted hill the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\nHow so how do I want a blind woman and seller man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for a while when are we just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know into UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWill assure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and uh you know all sorts of things\nYou know I think that the curiosity for this a cult than a supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the Steve although a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\nYou know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre gets has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the tech stream from has with that there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is money I think the area is why you know and you could go back and you watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw\nAnd the the how weird their house was with all the the mold mobiles made out of phones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those were really I think they're really sloppy slap bash [noise]\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw as they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they were fighting over one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho lose shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not one to ... did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of ... Mellon that they have laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is standing there stroking his chair and watching this down guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down stabbing all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter]\n... let's say a word and asked me to walk out the door he just says Christopher\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because\nThat was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was the ... when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night job he couldn't handle it\nAnd it wasn't because it was scary it was because people hadn't had a become accustomed to the found footage\nFirst person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of first of the sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that that movie was a that was the director hat final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from where the Blair Witch is supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happens do they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and you know you and nowadays I think that would be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it just you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine\nA food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhen did you think of Freddie Krueger the nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kind of just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nEighty four but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and and it's great marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dreams skates which I came in the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nAny any are no more never they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the Obama Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the father do very much for the Australian film I Believe uh it's about I'm a mother and her child and ah they are basically kind of dealing with the grief a of a lost all of a spouse\nOr whatever and a father I'm ... I think it's manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know he's got like a top hat and kind of frighten ... kind of hair a he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I I didn't really I mean it just it didn't I never really believe that the ... but that wasn't the part of that is why\nI didn't like that it seemed like a two hours don't walk commercial where it was just this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your brief you just have to feed it [noise]\nWhat is it about a horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think it's you you sir you won I think there's two there's two aspects of the roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to you get All right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun that you want to get back on it again\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in for after a while to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fine\nUh and I think that you know you you you you you're safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing we'll things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "05"}
