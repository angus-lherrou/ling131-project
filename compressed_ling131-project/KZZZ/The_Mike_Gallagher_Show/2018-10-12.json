the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollars in next time it goes to four\nInstead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly these big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy

two days is really taking in which the cause is it just panic or ... which\nWill will will to things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds\nShoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke I keep point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty\nI'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and said look at breaks twenty six forty\nThat that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to grow up which it has and it causes\nGross to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do\nIf the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing they lower interest rates would say now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the Trump wrecking it no\nThis was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's close\nWhat have you read in a couple of more D's downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people start saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kind of like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market it happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei in the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including the tech rack and recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months\nWhere people get whacked and that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble\nHas finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so are there the danger sign as if we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points and may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the ballot\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the Dow if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty for fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy\nEighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous\nUh uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asks what what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit\nBecause that's how this ... this was above all this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice there tastes manner and goes down bottles go up dramatically and they crash and and half the time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the signs to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge this if we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so correction by the end of the year than we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and in their debt has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like\nWent sideways and didn't the laboratory debt emerging countries one on us free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that bubble of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop if they just filled the tub back up with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty per\nSe she was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come bacteria dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and ...\n... ... who goes to ... am at no available bribe bone in now Android ... libre on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build the dot com crash came in the last year and a six\nTo seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked in ...\nTime's kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently crafting a lot of companies will not have well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even at the earnings of companies if companies are so good\nThat they keep their earnings flat instead of declining the valuations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty in in sixty or eighty for the best tax talk\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator some of the danger is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know it's not a secret well I Know I Know\nBelieve me Wall Street won't if there's any way you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stop and and and then when things go down there the ones that jumping and by when when when they see the old investors involved were bought in stocks or about they're the ones that short first I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action whether there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money that traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's going to open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect them so that's one of those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour end of the clothes so they measure this indicator measures what the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crack now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico on them\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between\nMaria here and Michael both of 'em similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has\n... in ... to islands that are like St Thomas and St Croix or St John and and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there and and I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family\nFor many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but um we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming in I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty\nMinutes an advanced they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tell the law\nCheck your id they just wait to see how you're going to ...\nNot sure I liked that part well\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island and one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here\nWhich are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantage so I'm living much cheaper than a minute and a great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director in Miami and two hours and and almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way if I have to go out to California which I just did\nFor a long time\nThat the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and shrubs down here and actually a lot of the banks are by banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but there there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people\nEither John [laughter] or they think we're in Zimbabwe or\nThey charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find her that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like that otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower\nUm mind that we need both in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why\nSixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S is better to help create good jobs down here through tax advantages rather than just out and out subsidize Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S as always always robbing their best people then again it it's they're more professional educated people are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year boost country seems to be mired right now in conflict\nYou ... you know unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nIt does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in his zero our book", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "12"}
