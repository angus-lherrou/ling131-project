leave again it was really kind of in good fun\nAnd I was shocked when she wrote in her book and it's just a minor point but she called the good guy in her book and she said that\nIt it it it was a reflection of how what a good person I Am that I knew she was going to ask me about it on air and I came on the show anyway\nWell I guess I'm not that good a person because I wasn't briefed at all or perhaps she was going to ask me it was I was blindsided by it which is fine I I mean that's a good blindsided every time I go to a caller such okay\nWell that's a little bit interesting I don't know

tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a ... with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we've had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft and Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUm we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThe buttons scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\n... some of the butter no as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the Bo Sox he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to fit it in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll say some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\nPreserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of a [noise] you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to opt load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about a ...\nWe'll uh in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net of business is the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net hit racks itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen is the day when we ... with the use of one of these ... that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a\n... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning\nOf the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore\nOnce you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can write about that tonight we will I I think that's the way to go not cryogenic ... is a kind\nOf an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a I think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nYou know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nI couldn't go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh I Know absolutely\nAnd and you're right that this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies ... are are kind of one foot in the presence and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky one you know the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is and mortality\nIn any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell in ... I'm reminded them the the\nCrazy well in ... I'm reminded of the ... the ... song\nA giant I inevitably come back to an subjects like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men not ... and ... and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because\nThis book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being the ...\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can look because we should do and the arts are really important in their shoes so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing some things we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the freedom to kind of you know opine about this\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described\nAll fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right and so that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes that you can imagine\nOh no it's not I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming the scientists since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on the Cornell where I got my PHD and physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I have become a man of faith a faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets of faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and\nThe new book is uh is is just great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n[noise] about the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into some\nLike whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for the what is the ultimate was the end use for that um other than our own human vanity we become more\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think in another concern a in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I wouldn't just pick that as an example there is a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration under eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to who the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often picks\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're faking it in the we're taking it as it\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting I talk about in the book\nDoes regular I Know you talk like that do the people in Salem no use in that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured it the late night show so\nI'm trying to get a leg you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know never mind ... I got to worry about my wife you know they have to say what you said why but uh [laughter] but um but I talk about how\nA lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses\nRent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again away stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging on ... ... ... lives in ... which puzzles because yes the idea of having a bug house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has has that philosophies\nRight you have an outdoor tuna and yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm more thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral elites any we could\nYou know a ... quantify society gets the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come\nTo there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more lock from issue well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting I by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nI had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always\nLike playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious has said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up for what he\nDoes not just a job and you know he has though [laughter] I was at ... pointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in\nPhysics at college right now [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it's in ...\nI I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nAre designed to work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious belief fight for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure\nUm ... what what we learn is that oh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't that I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nWhy are we doing here and then I think what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I got a minute oh\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by half with the staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it well and now here's an inch now let me ... is a little differently yeah there was a\n... ... humans killed off species they didn't die out no actually they were killed off\nAs opposed to say\nEvolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow the evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nThe fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand lead these really big exits you know human could eat off days and so I mean they've done so I mean I I realize you could make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that Darren brought him back in ... introduced into the wild not enough time has passed that he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nUm but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we start making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be that's the one I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes ... I think becomes done right scary because who is going to be making these decisions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "27"}
