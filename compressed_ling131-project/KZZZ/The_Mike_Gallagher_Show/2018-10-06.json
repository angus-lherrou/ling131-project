I would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but the definitely know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who die\nBut take definitely know that

no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth\nYou're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you get or herbs in pictures

what have you concluded Bob\n[laughter] well I really believe it's pretty easy and you hate to put this out there but it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a

when you see him come out of his house and gun his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't death you\nKnow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you try to throw under the bus it you never know what\nGoes around comes true that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get this done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody\nThey pretty much know it easily the three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two are all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second day to\nThe job right down the toilet so something's going on but if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how to remove negative energy once that's taken off because and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you can definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you find the same thing with health if a person has a curse on them and they've got a bad health\nAnd you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you'd have blood work done the doctor goes no everything is\nNormal there's nothing wrong we can't find anything\nBut gosh if you have a curse
