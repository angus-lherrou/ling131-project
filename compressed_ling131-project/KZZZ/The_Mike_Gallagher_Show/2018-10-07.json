pretty foul ball and put this aside from that word you not fact so that some people are more apt to become a quality a few hours and that at certain times it just seems to function better than perhaps with others\nKnown All right let's let's narrow that down to the first part of your question [noise] um the government indeed experimented with mind altering substances were there ever a or if you can't answer this and I'd rather have the answer that you can't answer it but we're there ever attempts that you were aware\nTo enhance the ability of a remote viewer with some sort of a psychedelic chemical\nOr I think that uh some experiments were tried\nA with a medical project that was a attempted on you know to see what happens physiologically with remote viewers are as far as I Know\nThe Sri project and I'm absolutely certainly ah Fort made a\nOperational group never did that oh the feeling was and I I'm very firm about this than anything you do to build your mind or is going to do your results and uh\nWell I I have some science in Missouri but some would contend Lynn that not all drugs do the mind uh some of them alter its date to a degree I certainly there are many drugs adult in mind or photos of the mind but there are some drugs that some would argue alter\nYour state uh and don't so much fun as it up at all for it and and so I can see that\nThat would certainly be one area that they would want to know about\nYes and I think the uh like I say I think the medical experiments did some of this but I Know that we didn't oh I Know that my own preference is\nOh oh I Want a remote view with it being made that does it uh here you know I\nAm very opposed to drugs and especially anyone room you know doing drugs while remote view and I just wouldn't trust results\nAren't

or it ... it has anybody ever run into what we would think of or know of as the\nDevil uh absolutely hold a there have been times I Know in my view in when there has been just ...\nTimes I Know in my viewing when there has been just a a presence of evil but generally the evil that I've found has been and the people we were tasked with\nUh uh the\nThe ... gallery of our targets was a was pretty severe oh did that did that get really tiresome extremely or one of the problems here is that uh as you access so much mind the\nAh [noise]\nThe way to enhance that access is to start agreeing with them and sort of lose your own\nPersonality and at a at the end of the session you really have to detoxify or else you wind up taking it easy I mean home with you yeah and ah and ah now there's one evil dude\nOr how do you how do you learn to let it go why I was eight nine one one dispatcher for Monterey County for a year and a damn near killed me I I actually had to leave because I kept taking my job home with me you know how do you not take idi Amin home with you there\nIs a process of a sitting there and going over everything you've found in the session and saying you know is that mayor

that they don't to understand that that's that's being utilized I from what I gather the gray matter in front of your mind is the part that they they have\nA no knowledge of what it does is it are we starting to evolve to use this now\nOr I Will ask are we do evolving I'm Wondering about the\nUh I don't think we're evolving ... up until the beginning of this year I Would have answered the question with I don't know but I Hope so uh an event happened at the beginning of this year\nOh I had always been adamantly against group teaching because it's just such an individualized thing but I started oh\nI've taught one group class mainly to to get people to shut up you know trying to get me to teach it I just wanted to prove that it wouldn't work and um\n[noise] the ah the response of the students are they\nThey picked up on this so quickly\nUh one of my a\nPrevious students was there a and the class you know just to come and talk about his experiences and and uh at the end of the the two days of group training he came up to me and he said he said what's happening here it took me seven much to get to this point um\nI think I Believe in the well and I believe in the uh show direct effect\nThat the more people who learned to do this the easier it gets to do it and um and ah\nNot that implies ... some sort of a mass\nConsciousness uh doesn't it that's\nRight and the share be process I mean ties right straight into that\nAll right Lynn ... last night there were at the bottom of the hour we'll be right back and pick up on that point\nThe trip back in time continue with art

preserve all of the information at the same time like a pentium\nTo computer [laughter]\n[noise] uh [noise] excuse me uh I here's another place where I Would say I hope so I Hope that we can get to the point where we understand each other better\nWhere ah where good intentions are realized as good intentions and so forth I think it's possible and I oh I Know that there are many influences oh\nThat whole people back and I just hope that those influences aren't as strong as man's desire to go forward [noise]\nOf the most frustrating things is that that that we hear all the information coming at us and that we can't interchange it as quickly as we wish to\nYou know anything about Jane Roberts\nOh they glee mhm uh and also another question or a Frank corporate wrote a book called doing and that the threats that mount Dave was seen as a as far as the future was concerned right ... ... ... is our future and threads ... as he kind of alluded to\nA good question\nUh let me uh oh refresh my memory unless it's been a long time since I read doing uh uh the threads Maine oh there was there's another tonight or\nMany many a multi faceted interconnected a future ...\nI was getting that oh many possibilities\nRight uh I think so oh I was getting that confused with another science fiction which has a threads dropping from the sky and uh\nAnd uh as plant pathogens are killing all the life out there is a science fiction book out to the um I think that uh\nWill find that there are many paths we can go down and so now I don't know about alternate universes as far as I'm concerned I stick with one\nOh and so that one is the one I'm concerned about ah but I think there are many threats yes I think there are many as we can go down\nI Would be utterly remiss if I didn't pop this has to be asked question 'cause nobody else has yet I'm colonel in Spokane would like to know if you have remote viewed the Kennedy assassination\nNo I have not um intentionally in fact a really yes there are some things that um people always ask about\nYou know have you remote viewed or a Marilyn Monroe is\nThis the Kennedy assassination uh OJ Simpson oh I generally stay away from these simply because uh you know I can get an answer\nA through remote viewing the what the purpose be I couldn't change it and the only purpose would be to uh\nTo beat beat on my chest and say you know I've remote viewed this and here's what I found a and I don't do that I keep a low key\nPersonally I think there'd be a lot more joy in remote viewing Marilyn Monroe life\nRight [laughter] a while a limit let me\nSay one thing or if I get a remote viewer well I asked the remote viewers to work at least five missing children cases or after they graduate course uh-huh we find one kid\nAnd uh I'll tell you they're hooked they don't care about ... a Marilyn Monroe or or O.J Simpson anymore at all\nThe time to stand a wildcard line you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nGood money you're out from ... a ... a great things the Calgary, Alberta Yes sir\nAre Seventy seven I then I and our or have you ever heard of Jose\nAnd are there have you ever heard of a whole is a silver method a it was mainly on their mind control but we did lots of remarked viewing\nRight um uh yes and the a\nRemote viewing ah was basically taken\nBy the uh show the people and or is not the classical definition of remote viewing now are the people who do the show the mind a mind work that ah I've met\nHave very good results and I say if it works use it um\nIt's the step taught by the silver group is not the controlled situational\nA laboratory provable\nClassic remote viewing\nOr an excellent question would you favor I said one of your share a ball or a remote to forecast or our current affairs back to your credit that Palestine set of the corn for all of the art Tyler it's\nAll right in other words some sort of something that you can tell us is going to occur that will serve as a ...\nWell I basically already have a the\nUm\nResults is I've been getting from the a plant pathogen thing or the attack on the U.S yes um I get the impression that it's going to be happening sometimes is a spring or fall of this year\nI you know even though you feel the results will be different or more localized a hearing that from you Anne from it deems is very worrisome\nOh it is to me to uh in fact uh one of the questions that I have on that subject your of your age someone asked me about it and um I said that uh if it shows up on the Internet\nThan these ah ah what's called open source or intelligence gatherers they gather intelligence from newspapers magazines the Internet so ah they have search engines\nAnd if I speak about this on the Internet I Know that by the next morning oh\nOh if I have said the word\nUh Hussein Arab country or stuff like this than that one ship and an intelligence database and a foreign country room and it's my hope to say these things in order to hopefully get some things change in other words I Hope I'm wrong\nAnd will actively pursue anything I can to be wrong\nSo you're you're trying to influence a\nFuture on user events\nI yes uh-huh or if you if you see the future and it's not what you want it to be then uh I have no qualms and changing it [laughter]\nOne obvious question for a remote viewer mhm is have you ever thought of or in fact have you remote viewed your own time of death\nYes I have uh-huh oh I find it to be a fairly peaceful death oh\nOh I don't know how much that is wishful thinking that oh that's you know the impression I got no this was in the steel down below that I didn't know what I was a what I was viewing what the target was and basically what I got was a\nAn old fat man with a you know in a in a bed with people around him that care\nUh well that's that's a good result um I I Wonder though are about the\nDanger of giving somebody a target of that nature in other words you've instead of the old

I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders is will if when they're going to come up\nWith this conversation I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it will be like that\nOne of the things that I Love about about you know to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists\nAll the the the conservative sometimes get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the cult which is not but it's it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's where I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences the coming over time\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal it festival called ah when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about it just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice um and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them it was very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people who are celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes that was a time to you know to a store grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the uh the the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous\nThe the the separation between the world's with especially thin porous so the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you on the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why are the the began talking about how\nSpirits would a would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to ah the spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um it in a leader incarnations of Halloween it was also at a time it's porous\nAnd so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it'd be a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that the that are for example woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and there would be a proxy and often times the prophecy a was\nUm either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be would a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example is up for Apple you know if you're on your feet apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and passing credit coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] actually I Do it and do it at midnight\nRide on willfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow 'cause I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it is fine I see it as\nA I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think this fall whether I think an orange and black colors yeah I think a fake little cartoon that we would\nWatch like which isn't the goblins and and the theory fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the tradition John editing and er I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here\nBut what we have and Dan Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a has caused the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's will is we have and you don't know what you might hear [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBack to coast to coast am county will is here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford bend so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the ...\nAnd I like when people dress up you know like the ... Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like it sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like your regular normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\n... you know the the any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman masking make make something out of it you know\nYeah agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly children ... and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids\nIt wasn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing are getting sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the early a Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season the darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was a to honor that the church a church members to gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills were wrong for the soul purgatory\nAnd so there was this was interesting transition from an early purely pagan he um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things you know sold day\nAnd and again they were the ... ah bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what would happen is\nUm ah you know could we are talking about you know where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would wear animal skins I'm there and sometimes animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual is sick thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween for praying for the dead and this again the ties back into all souls day 'cause the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the soul of the word predatory you know there were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthy members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these ... and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into the [laughter] the the the uh the public and um but the\nCandle at the land from the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for\nThe idea was that they would these members go out for house to house so you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this late as the the souls which wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of the sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if\nYou ask me to read [laughter] when when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on [laughter] ... salt pepper I'm so worried candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it was interesting 'cause ... it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what what happened is\nThings sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again that was the ... the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time of the the genders had pretty strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would ah would pining away with full you think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows 'cause that's\nWhat they did a but you know ... that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man you know ... a mixture of this young man's project and the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for a little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's a little a little a little outlandish for for the little little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like\nReally really a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good house together since they were there were years where you get full science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you rent if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get poolside bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only perimeter marathon learn that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm does I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's\nA horrible ... you got a full on you got a phone line is you can't replace\nA wish I had been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those old nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we would never say one house at all he had homemade popcorn ball they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear a razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like ... you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all the research the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison candy scares\nAnd the reason the yeah and\nThe fact is that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that I'm In and you know so when you actually look at\nAt the cases where somebody who's actually tainted these sorts of things um it it happens very rarely there there was one case of what he points to it was a case", "year":
