protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as ... as well tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey want them back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show for the fifth time and a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planets\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things which people but it seems to also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividual in the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and a and the truth tradition of that that\nThere is a veil a of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media tastes more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever using demonic spiritual will get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely uh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counter part of angels\nThere that powerful they are not regular people who have died just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the pack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and a demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit and a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are are much better equipped\nTo ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically ... for information\nInto our system or emotional systems making\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other other people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits\nIt's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nA so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of asked and spirits and all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate\n... kind of like a river that travels underneath our\nConsciousness and they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spears people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful\nThan me that's right that's you know they could they could come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes

now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nDid you see them I can you ... I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom\nSome were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with their school work and some are looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to get a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about these demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the\n... the new version of the ... the a map is now available for I don't know ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThere's some exciting news simply safest now valued at one billion dollars this company used to be just five guys working together\nNow they protect more than two million people simply say system as easy to use incredibly intuitive and takes just minutes to shut up\nThere no contracts are hidden season twenty four seven monitoring is only fourteen Ninety nine a month visit simply signatory dot com the order you simply safe system now and you'll get free shipping and free returns that simply safe no re dot com simply say nor dot com\nI Love at first you need to be up and gave me the bass setting I have a nice Harry answering you dance everyday on your favorite ...\nMake a fifty dollar on my video Franklin and you get a free make up ... every month you can help to breast cancer research and making an insect any sense states mental saying everything stage I think ...\n... ... when we try to become a horse I thought I had I lodged top condition he's also the world's biggest killer of who stopped pecking kind of war I think it's just been\nAnd I will kill I decided to stop that can kind of ... it's just incredible feeling set on the Muscle Shoals touches pins and needles round my hot when I have the extra cottage or and two and a half months later\nSomething amazing ... which will be will taste why my hot actually contract almost staggering it that this was the staging a cheaper ... to ...

we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human said humans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control\nSpirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack\nChildren in their cribs the ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that in Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives\nAnd also check to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where\nThey want to sell they sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of a home apartment condo party or barring a pile of any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd so on were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they don't know that there are there and they may not believe\nThem but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nGet us to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are just experts added they have weapons they have devices\nJust experts added they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely our own or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I ... but my spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families getting them to fight or getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify\nWhat would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pull out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirits you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good\nUh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible they have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack\nPeople least able to defend themselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city":
