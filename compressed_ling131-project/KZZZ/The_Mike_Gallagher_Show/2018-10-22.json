I have a dried acre only drive\nOut but I but I tell people when they borrow my car don't go through a pot [laughter]\nAll right at least you know what to do now terrific I have a great day Cheryl appreciate the call one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five Senate let's go now to Aaron Aaron as a two thousand one dodge ram pickup how many miles on your pickup truck there Aaron\nAs about a hundred and twenty five thousand\nAll right very good and today you're calling about your transmission how can we help you\nYeah so at a pretty strange uh it's\nKind of an intermittent problem and ah sometimes it won't shift out of first year and I noticed that happens usually when I'm about empty a on gas and\nAll fall into a gas station and all fill it up all the way and then um I leave the gas station and it starts to ship normal again\nOkay any check engine lights come on or anything different other than ah the little fuel\nI'm no nothing different I mean there is a check engine light on I mean it it kind of bent on\nYeah but you know what why it sounded you know the code or what are the reason why is it a mission control problem do you know any idea\nUm no I did check it a while back and I I forgot what it was okay but it is\nWell that does help if you would know but on this issue this is what I think what's going on so you're low on fuel your engine and your transmission work as a team will say for an example that you're running out of fuel or it's running lean\nThe transmission is not going to shift until it has the available fuel pressure in order for the engine power to go up for the transmission the shift is going into what we call them limp in mode\nAnd you would know that if your check engine light was not on normally it would go on to let you know that that was a problem in that particular point could be a lot of different things in your it could be just your your fuel pick up in the in the fuel tank\nUh for some reason has been is been pushed up and left\nPushed up so it's it's getting half the fuel and that's why it's running lean so I'm going to tell you something and this particular case it's going to sound really strange and that is never let it go below a quarter of a tank\nOr a four have the fuel pump and and that replaced while they're in there because it's not much more money it's all labor or and then have them find out a lot of times people put too much feel and their tank evil once or twice in the middle of summer\nAnd the the the take we'll go we'll explode even if it's plastic it'll it doesn't explore what I mean by that it it pushes it ... it puffs out and when that does what happens is it puts a bigger gap between the fuel pick up and the fuel itself and that's probably what's happening in your case\nOh okay All right so it's nothing serious but get your check engine light fixed you know find out what it is because you can have something that's costing you a lot of money in the long run with fuel economy\nRight okay so that I won't I won't ah yell at you\nToo bad how do you how do you use the truck is a tough for pushing snow overhauling or\nIt's just a an old work ...\nOkay yeah I was there you go oh I appreciate it or have a good day for your call let's go to Jeff Jeff has an overweight Pontiac a G ...\nJ six yeah and how many miles on her there Jeffrey well I bought it use and you won't believe it but it's got twenty seven thousand miles oh that's great what color [laughter] great\nGrand a year ago they were read All right so do you call me by a power steering what's what's going on with\nIt OK what happens is when I got the car you know I drove it around for a week everything was fine but every so often when I'm driving down the road it's almost like the power steering goes out then it comes back in ...\nIt's almost like the power steering goes out comes back in ... scaring goes it goes back and and then it can be fine for you know a day or so and there's no rhyme or reason to want to comment that I shop a couple of times [noise] God lives when you take this shop it's not doing it\nRight right now let me ask you a question does the steering wheel when you're when that happens doesn't ever rock back and forth left reality\nShow it rocks okay so here's the other issue there's two types of power steering systems that could be on their vehicle want is a hydraulic where if you look down at the engine you're going to see a reservoir for so you can check your power scary while\nAs far as electric okay that's the next thing the next one is is it's electric well what what is probably happened okay you bought this\nWith low mileage have you um did you have any type of a window seat tigers replaced or any of my time at work\nThey act like off the clock it reflects on tires\nOkay so here's what can happen okay this is a\nCritical because of electronics okay stay replace the tires and at the same time they replace it most tiger shops will say hey you know why let's protect your investment\nOK latch instead of just putting the tires on let's let's check the line and maybe in your case it needed a four wheel line that's OK okay any time that the movie's high rod ends you know now left right or whatever they did or changed camper\nA there's a procedure you have to do where you have to reach that it's called you all why AWOL\nI mean what it is your car probably has the ability to control and what it does it tells the the computer that you're going straight down the road and you have to be done on so if the line was off\nThey put the tires on and they did not do a ... shot\nYou will have that problem where you'll lose your steering and like I said then you'll actually let me know if it does that say well you're the cars now David even moving you see the steering wheel rocking by itself left and right\nNow that I'm like well\nHere's what you need to do you need to have this theory censor\nRecess if they can't read that it has to be replaced in asking you replace it\nFour hundred dollars to handle that it oh\nYou'll yell [laughter]\nThere you go for the call there yes\nWe are the one the only the original we are the shows\nAnd actually they can be stressful it's soaking getting your car repair\nOur friends with car star that provided a comprehensive list of either but you should consider torture your vehicle was repair correctly standing at least thirty minutes to complete the process\nYes when you start the vehicle up this is going to make up a way to go for diagnostics we need to know this uh cars in park you started\nThe engine rpm should go up to maybe eleven hundred twelve hundred and they should drop down to seven fifty or the the L K and then when you place it in drive or it should still stay at seven and said did you know if it ever drops below seven hundred and fifty\nYeah it'll it'll be at six fifty sometimes you know like in ... and just sitting there and neutral here maybe as I go to ... same kind of watch that I leave it on because it tells me right what you know what may happen has happened so\nHere's what you need to do you need to have the fuel system cleaned you're going to have to have the throttle body cleaned the mass Airflow censor ah upper induction system and if you do if you're around that mileage points where there's a hundred thousand miles on spark plugs what you're going to want to do is do this aggressive cleaning\nAnd then after the cleaning gonna wanna probably drive it for a week or so and have sparked what's changed and so we don't want to do is to replace spark plugs and contaminated with these chemicals for cleaning the system you'll find out after this cleaning most likely the stalling problem will go away 'cause you haven't mentioned anything about a check engine light\nAnd uh you should watch no again you know a lot of people don't pay any attention to it but you should really you know when you started you watch it goes up to twelve hundred should hang in there are a little been slowly creep down in many cases you may not even see that rpm change which is an indication that the throttle body and the fuel systems extremely dirty\nOkay I Do get a service steering system okay now here we go again we're running out of low idle speed\nAnd if you're running at a low idle speed that can create that problem too because the engine are ... fast keep in mind that every time you make a turn the power steering pressures which kicked singer loading everything down you've got your air conditioning on you've got other components that put a load on the engine\nSo what's the computer seeing is that the engine rpm are too low so that service code may go away when you resolve the problem with the engine idle speed or you know running a at warm temperature in dry should always read about seven hundred seven hundred and fifty\nRight okay and someone says like the there's a switch and the steering system or something that needs to be replaced\nKnow that actually tells you that it's working because what it's doing is commanding it should be commanding the computer too\nWorking because what it's doing its commanding it should be commanding the computer to increase anytime you put a load on your turn the AC on the engine rpm should go up you turn on the steering wheel the computer takes oh anytime there's\nAn rpm drop it should increase it back up you have the uh is that what they're talking about is the transducers or or switch whatever you want to call it but\nIf that weren't working then you you really know the and it would have happened all at once we think that it's a long term thing and now you're just at that point where now it's really critical and you need to get everything cleaned and bring it up to\nAnd after that it's all done one of the things that come to mind to as you if you had an idle speak control motor that's no longer working a correctly\nOr that could be the cause of it is true but you still want to have the cleaning done and asked the cleaning stunned that will help the idol speak control motor work to write the ... often called like a major cleaning or his or her now fuel injection cleaning you know you can have um there's an induction system cleaning and the fuel system clean and you want both performed\nAnd what's often forgotten about on the on the back of your car's fuel filled her up underneath makes sure that's changed also\n... okay okay All right great very good thank you very much\nAlready have a great day thanks for calling us here on the cars are

as the two thousand four Ford F. one fifty\nTim how many miles on your a pickup truck\nSeventy five thousand fight and today you're calling about oil what can we do for you\nYeah this is a follow up to a conversation we had last weekend that I was driving on free way last oil pressure shut the engines down\nAnd uh realize that there was no oil and the angel got off the side of the road so we got her home the engine was locked up I pull all the spark plugs and are still couldn't get a turnover pulled the circuit king belt they did start turning over so\nWhen I had all the plugs out I wanted to make sure that all cylinders a head or re lubricate it sought put about a cup cup and a half oil and each cell under\n... with a plucked out got his watch the Oilers like could with that than I sprayed it with a\nSprayed each so under with her ... her and a compressed air and then you guys recommended I changed or which I did my problem now is that\nI Can't uh there was a question you recommended that I Do a ... ushering test on each shoulder\nTo find out which if any have lost compression ... all my problems is this is a very unique our clock at twelve twelve bucks on these things it takes some nights sixteenth plug socket mhm and I have been unable to locate a crushing engaged that will read into goes\nA ... threat into the spark plug holes\nSo if I'm Still unable after this conversation to find one\nHow much oil should I re inject into each so under a to make sure that uh to to re engage the pressure on the compression ratings\nWould you ... once the rings are stuck in the Lancet the pistons you don't re engage anything they're stuck a okay at this point\nUh because of possibly overheating or even because of where there are companies out there but it's your major tool manufacturers for professional use that make a compression that's not to gauge the adaptor it'll be a long flexible hose with the end that will be able to screw in\nWhat we were concerned about is not necessarily you putting oil and to do a wet compression test you're going to pull all the spark plugs disabled the ignition system in the field system\nAnd what we're going to look for is what compression there is when it's dry and that's going to be that's going to be the the dead giveaway there and then of course you take the dry test regular numbers down\nThen you put a couple of squirts oiling that cellar to then take another test again and if that compression increases considerably than we know that the rings are are most likely seized within the pistons and if I remember correctly this is the vehicle that\nCame from an airport than idled all yes and then of course running it out of oil low on oil is not a good thing\nUm and keep in mind that of course when you know the the it was locked up are tied up a ... and see if we don't know if it was on the main bearings ... or I doubt very much if it did anything in the uh in the in the cylinders except for the fact the heat itself caused the ring lands for the pistons disease\nSo damn you shouldn't have a problem getting a compression adapter which he won like like Dan said just a small extension hose that goes right to the compression tester or the gauge\nAnd ah it shouldn't be a problem and in fact you might check your local part stores they a lot of times we'll let you use that adapter or the compression gauge and if you buy your parts from them so it it can be done his little is no charge at all so that's why I Would recommend\nI understand that and I tried that with two different gauges that has to fourteen millimeter extension what I'll be doggone I spent two hours trying to spin those things in it I cannot seem to get it to to\nUh act are screwing yeah\nWell there's a reason for that is because of the threads on the block don't start if you take a look at your spark plug in and look at the length of the plug in ... you're going to find out your diner while well there's there's no threads there but so they like I said the major told me I have\nNine zero nine five seven that is a\nType of use you're going to be using a air cooled single cylinder you're going to want to go with a straight white oil ah you're going to want to make sure it's a detergent oil there's two different oils and detergent a non detergent and overall you'll probably have the best of luck with the straight thirty weight because again it's it's air cooled and not water cooled\nA traditionally that size is going to hold anywhere between two to three quirks oil\nAh ah other issue is when he purchased ... gave you a a kid where you have a rubber hoses extension or two\nAnd a two foot in on top of the frame so you can easily drain the oil without the oil drinking on the chance to be on the lawn\nOr it's like a like a like a soccer or something like ... or ... or ...\nYes that's exactly very simple procedure in some of the long wars like that well even have a spin on oil filter\nIt is\nVery straightforward\nOr whenever you have a question and that's not necessarily just for you so much for any one\nOf the owner's manual tell you specifically what do you use and want to use it because of like a dance that if you're going to use this as a plow during the winter than we would suggest not to use the thirty weight oil during the winter we would suggest you use the multi the Scott study which would be a W thirty\nAre very good thanks for the call there so we're going to take a break when we come back we're going to talk to David ...

got a question we got the answer because we have a car show\nAn accident you be stressful and so keep getting your car repair\nOur friends or car star at provided a comprehensive list of either but you should consider torture your vehicle was repair correctly not spending at least thirty minutes to complete the process\nIs your parents can be complex review the vehicle but the person who wrote the stomach or will deliver to repair ask questions and take the time necessary to examine the repair it's also a good idea to compare the original watched about what the final bill\nAnd what's it's tied up then you're done I mean what's the sign up then yeah you absolutely have to but I Would at least see if there's enough oil in there now run the vehicles see if the noises all went away if the if the noises all went away\nThen I wouldn't take a long trip with it but I Would drive around the town to see if it came back to life but let's let's assume for a second you do need an image and\nIf you need an inch and the question now is what condition is the rest of the car before you decide to put an engine in it you want to check everything else out suspension\nTires breaks you know what's the condition of the body um money you know take a take a look at it this way you have a ten year old vehicle was that many miles on it a and will say this repair if they go maybe with a salvage yard engine or if you go with a ... you know you could have a five or six thousand dollar repair you could have a three thousand dollar repair\nSo your way back and you look at now say for example you're going to use a low mileage salvage yard engine there's nothing wrong with buying an engine from the salvage yard they're normally and they're not because the engines are worn out is because they were involved in an accident and you're going to use that good component because of the fact of cost\nSo if you wave that all out and say well it's going to cost me three thousand dollars knowing that the rest of the vehicles find that doesn't need tires or whatever you'd sit back and you look now can I buy a car this nice for three thousand dollars that'll possibly be able to get another hundred thousand miles out of\nSo that's ... it's it's a financial thing and it's also a condition thing you don't want to my thing is step over a ten dollar bill to save a buck also right\nYeah so you keep in mind if you bought a thirty thousand dollar car ah I think your taxes somewhere around seven and a quarter percent sales tax and so you're going to be spending almost that much money and sales tax if you bought a new car\nNow she bought a used car course it's going to be much less uh I'm In favor of putting an engine in there as long as the rest of the the vehicles in great condition plus you're right now that car the value that car is probably worth a hundred hundred and fifty dollars at a jumpstart if it doesn't run\nIf you put an engine in it all of a sudden now you could probably get your money right back\nIn engine in it all of a sudden you could probably get your money right back uh out of it once you use it for a while so the investment is not a bad deal\nOkay I really appreciate that ...\nAnd the other question as you're saying where does the oil go well when we have older vehicles that have a lot of miles and people neglect the time that they change oil will say that you had five thousand miles from the last oil change when the oil because it's dirty the oil is slowly consumed by the engine breaks down it breaks down and it's using the oil so if\nIt went without an oil change for a while and no one actually physically checked it on this than just\nThat it ... it actually ingested the oil went out the exhaust very slowly your daughter or anyone would have never noticed it by the way it does your daughter go to hell state\nI Know she's ... she graduated from right state but my son go to I ...\nI saw that you're from and it is it the car she drives yes yeah I\nKnow what she might not have been right at border for medical school she might be a great doctor but when it comes to changing the oil she may be a little off on you know I got to say I actually heard that takes care of it so what has been so well maintain that's why we're such prized about\nYou but you know what caffeine and this is something that's happened in our family just this week when when we give our children a vehicle or grandchildren a vehicle the first thing we should be telling them is we open the hood and show them where everything is checked\nOr the right when the oil especially and then once a month they should be checking the oil because chances are had she'd done that or had someone done that right or found out that they were one or two courts of oil and they would have put a red flag up to say well we need to we need to fill up the oil\nYeah that's what you're telling her father's work right now actually [laughter]\nAll right well there's a there's

was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoopla project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend David spent

investigations of missing people\nHe's never stopped thinking about or working on the big put mystery in tonight he's back with a book that's a great resource for anyone interested in this subject it traces the sasquatch story through the newspaper reports and historical records that name big what has been around as we know since Nineteen fifty eight\nI started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that they would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran the big story in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town starting to think about my police days and I used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and uh he would sit down with a witness be\nAble to draw the sketch from just the witness statements and the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met and right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd with Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and drop the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes\nThey immediately accept and\nI've done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd a kind of how it started\nA you say you don't have a dog in the white meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo or something I started the most vocal the most audacious\nThe most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kind of went down that path thinking well must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge out I had hair all over the body that there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera\nAnd it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say\nHarvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like and when you talk about the\nElders they would consistently say this is another tribal people just aren't animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least think coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area\nThat's right yeah ... ... in the tribal area method one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo one thing about the ... areas the trinity river I great salmon and steal head area a has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes\nOn the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's the mission evidence that something is real here\nOr do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were there were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nThen other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the fight pet went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the ... Arab region to uh Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when I was sent to Gen bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in this\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab but completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explain to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this [noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nHundred and ten samples cells tell a story that phenomenal when we come back we're going to get\n\nWhen we come back we're going to get into that a little bit more and then jump into specifics from ... new book big wild man and you hear renewed I Know I mean big but also your tickets or the\nIt uh this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see 'em on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are saying going to say well how do you know that's a big for their well ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Mel but did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta different what attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscience and you have a certain element of people who takes the cake their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they said well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part that I can say is it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human ...\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figured this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah then it got down to a row and under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you tend to eat this this will not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old article a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight oh did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as a description twenty four used eighth gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something\nElse now the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana all live in New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six\nAnd then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to get some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know a few overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the fame and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes out like six maps and then he puts up on that but he doesn't say anything because you know what this Napa because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same location of the big ...\n[laughter] and\nBut it was his statement\nAbout giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations that really kind of got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were they something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... and shown you have legends and stories about the big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and uh yeah what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find\nA lot of these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate where all these went and it set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't how\nYou look back and some of the description there's one early in your book is from the Marilyn good that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an encounter a witness sees this on themselves work number rubber an animal\nBetween twelve and fifteens deeds Hi it's a shape resembling a human ... the head with it which is an equal proportions the body the feet are two feet long and Harry\nUh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description so Mike modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds and I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up so one of the articles I I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about was in Nineteen thirty four there was a series of trail site incidents in Washington", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "22"}
