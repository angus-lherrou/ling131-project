productive and he just wrote so many great great shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends ... I wrote a book about the twilight zone and the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in his pool\n[laughter] well he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word on I don't know if you did most of them in the pool in the pool but he's\nCertainly dictated most description and us I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us\nAnd he was able to do it somehow so let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise]\nYou know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper he that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them in did he get that from his combat oh he's from his efforts yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several\nTimes a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually sat in lady um during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally\nRevisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while it's all\nYou was fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when\nTelevision was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up and television needed writers or was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod\nYou know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol surly rods wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the way they hit a tree with that quite a person and indeed I bet yeah yeah now with with\nRod he started before you got in the twilight zone user writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven\nA twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to the twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into was that he believed that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writers job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself\nThat they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction horror you know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a tell them that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now the ... it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the art is job the art if it's going to be art it has to do what he would say that has to say something about something\nAnd you know it has to be entertaining he did want to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... were then he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big ...\nWere dressed in his work well you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... believe that all evils stemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them\nSo he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own fault when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the toilets on before and after\nHe in some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about sixty years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred television series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series\nAnd the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it's lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter in a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I've got\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nAbout what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seed that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced you never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty like Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got back in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did him in you said that broad de ... do well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's\nYou know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories ha ha so if you know they do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with a buddy about the twilight zone Nick ... with us his book

you're very badly [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much really still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIt really you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it's still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the ... zone\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was runs surely and around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did is you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn the twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer buck out and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto was said you know everybody gets a little uptight yellow the you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around him\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd you know that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six uh six and seven and nine\nNow so how did they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon that course Leishman played by mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know it's called me up for in praise of pets\nI was busy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell a Angela car right now I've just released aren't novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing in time and go charge on purpose\nIt's called the devils river and chicken and all the adversary his weapons\nWell set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm you know he was thrown ancient\nAliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music too\nYou know capability thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick ... I was thinking George so that was great he was a I did run surely for you on this show you never know [laughter] you might you might call in from the from the other side what inspired you to write the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know ... by the show and and so that started everything and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he'd written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm dumb this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced or television or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been that had been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about so you know so that that was the idea of it\nBut it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the themes certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know delved into and et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes um [noise] the probably the most surprising thing that I found was he may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether\nThere's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly\nWhistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling wants to sell some version of\nThe story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance\nWhile I was able to find the very the actual first\nDraft of this script that rod wrote before\nAny of these um you know any of these uh interference is came into play and there have been several studies of this particular show and the evolution that it's ... from some you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you and now it's not\nAll that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he he admired Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... pasture but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination he\nAnd William fruit that one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a document\nThat they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we got to get something quick\nThat we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he managed to\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and William fruits had listened that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know ah I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "17"}
