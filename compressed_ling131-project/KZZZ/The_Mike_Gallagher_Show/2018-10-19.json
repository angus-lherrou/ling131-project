there to help you what happened\nRight absolutely and she said you know you could come with us if you'd like but it would be better if he stayed here because we have a lot of work for you to do and I said I'm really not interested and at that moment I don't think I had much choice because my cousin George realized my sister and I are in trouble came and told us both out and\nKind of unfair amount if if you're with on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut [noise] ah I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to teach me to swim for one probably in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an ... experience I was with my father's brother my uncle was a the twins and we're walking in a lake\nAnd ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I hit a hole in this lake in just like you down I went I must have been about eight years old Joyce and I'm\nIn I'm gone I and I thought this was it I'm dead and now we're back some upon me\nBack up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under he just kept walking but it was the weirdest feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nGood I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times\nOh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very close to ... like a thousand feet from them on the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah I mean is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know we've had to each other boy the thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's where my website where um what happened\nI I I actually had gone to sleep and that was awakened until it to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through and had created a portal\nIn my building and in my apartment and people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty and that was Battery Park so that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see it just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still out in that area Joyce\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things have people were just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if it was just something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record what you're experiencing and really happen that way and open up more than that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record\nThat's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLot of sure absolutely OK George thank you I had never heard of ... but ah I had an Audi about\nMaybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did ask to travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget it but we don't know about it but this was unusual because I went to a a Tibetan commentary at to see this\nLama whose name was ... and you know in Tibet George on the day the babies born that's the first name he was born on Tuesday says named Tuesday\nLob sang Canadians ramp\nAnd if you go to his website it's a lump saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to me and I went on this phenomenal trip to\nHis story and he had a the ability to answer many of my questions now this man had many walking experiences supposedly he was over many hundreds of years of age he had taken different bodies on the last one more out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman\nAnd his final incarnation on the earth and the Nineteen eighties\nSo I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back to my body brought me back and I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out lob sang ramp and I've misspelled it slightly put an H on it or it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things gone but I went to his website and I was blown away because he has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to the delicious\nYeah stream Lee cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die like St your main also was walking and George do you believe that that's possible you could take on\nA brother or incarnation\nI think George many [noise] mhm [noise] well I mean I'm I'm Still wrestling with\nLiving in Russia that we would crush you kind of strange for me
