of the battle battleground talkers tour for a whole bunch of people coming out and being energized invigorated optimistic they're such great news right now and it feels like Republicans\n... we know we've got a mountain to climb on November the ... less than two weeks away Americans are going to decide whether or not we're going to the um the speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi weather British she Maxine Waters in positions of leadership\nIn the in the in the on on the house side we're going to see if Republicans are going to lose control of this the Senate or will Republicans\nAre just lifted up by an incredible incredible amount of missteps\nAnd and and and news events that have happened in this country\nWill will will take Republicans to another miracle finish shorter like what we felt in November of twenty sixteen welcome back to well the relief factor dot com studios we've got a real treat for you a few years ago I've done a lot of these traveling tours around the country\nAnd a ... a few years ago during the twenty sixteen campaign I had the chance to go\nOn a number of cities with Newt Gingrich I'm not one of these big a\nRich famous people who travels by private jet but once in a while I get to go on one of these\nUm multi city chores or on a private jet with some of my colleagues from the sale and radio network in one year in particular I got to go with Newt Gingrich from city to city I think we did fourteen cities and twelve days and I got to sit next to former house Speaker Gingrich on the plane\nYou cannot say that she was wrong when she said back during the early phase of the Afghan war that it was okay for Americans to join the Taliban and she just you can't bring herself to say that it was wrong to recommend well by the Taliban is killing Americans\nThat it's okay to join the enemy or you you have the same thing Kathleen Morris Rogers as an opponent to try to raise\nA trip to Cuba because she didn't want to ask the defendant and every time you turn around you find you know a ... who was the number two person in the Democratic party nationally\nCongressman uh is now behind and his race for attorney general and frankly a guy who goes around wearing a T shirt in Spanish that says no borders are probably deserves to lose\nBut in addition he's had so many other problems that are he's ... he made right down the entire chicken and the Democratic party in Minnesota so alliance has been\nVery profound change in the nature of what we're in the middle of and I think there are historic precedents once you accept the idea that this was a period of very profound change\nAnd not only that ... you know you you you you list list some of these examples of what seems to be so much\nOver the top instances of Democrats behaving badly and were seen a lotta we're seeing a kind of a mob mentality this week uh the house majority leader Kevin McCarthy's office in Bakersfield had a giant Boulder thrown through the glass\nA window we've seen Mitch McConnell and his wife harassed in restaurants I'm ... and ... and and and knew this was coming from the top you got Democrat leaders encouraging people to get him Republicans faces draw crowds chased them I mean the word suction unhinged time that uh\nGotta believe this bodes well for us in November the six because a lot of Americans Republican independent maybe even Democrats are saying the only way to to stop this from continuing is to put to keep Republicans in power because if these guys are in control heaven help us\nWhy I Do think that the uh the whole notion of jobs not mobs or in the whole notion of how the former attorney general say when they're down kick them right now I think for most Americans that's just way too much yeah and so I Do think in that sense that there's a\nA substantial push\nOn their way or and and I think that being if he said he was just really the country on to become a and you look at this mob coming up from Central America and there was no other way to describe it as it says an invading force\nOr the or at least seven thousand and uh somebody was she just last night that there is another couple of thousand coming out of\nGuatemala now to join that so it may well be kind of twelve thousand before long ah you said if it were you really want to live in a world where these people believe they can come and impose on you or whatever they want\nAnd I think the Democrats are and that will bind\nI play a video clip yesterday um we're we're spending an hour with Newt Gingrich today on the Mike Gallagher show here in the relief factor dot com studios had a great event last night\nIn Philadelphia ... great great crowd for our battleground talkers tour tonight I'll be in Dallas uh and then later this weekend in Chicago so we're going around the country new knows these kinds of rallies very well it's fun to be with like minded people in a room full of excited energized\nUm citizens and or incidentally for ticket in Chicago a Freedom Summer could've battleground toured dot com battleground tour dot com I play that clip Mr Speaker yesterday of the president in Houston proudly proclaiming that he's a nationalist\nThe crowd roared with approval and then I follow that up with a clip from Don Lemon over at CNN who was literally just mortified\nOr at the word nationalist and he kind of conflated he seemed to tie in nationalist with I'm white nationalist white supremacist because you said the word nationalism is is a national TV\nAnchor host well nationalist as racist overtones anti Semitic overtones bigotry so I guess we're now in a place with the left\nWhere if you say you believe in America's sovereignty and you believe that America is the greatest nation on earth and you want to make America First as an American you're nothing but a stone cold bigot\nWell that that is the modern left the modern laughs loyalty is to some kind of vague global assume that the president's speech at the United nations was brilliant\nAnd the first really solid defense of America as a patriotic foreign policy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew\nPolicy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew the real distinction\nOr do you want an American government that worries about America if you have this with is the smog coming up from what from from Central America should the U.S government\nTo decide that we want to take care of the entire planet and if that means that we bankrupt America we eliminate are free to destroy our prosperity but at least we let the John Lennon standard of ... well\nYou know caring about the globe\nWhich was what ... what I always said that John Kerry really have to be given the past because he was actually the global secretary of state\nAnd that's why he can continue to meet with the Iranians are because he doesn't represent American policy and and the Obama administration was I think the first over a globalized administration where we've ever had and their view was that the United states was that if the weaker the United states was the better\nYeah but I but I have a theory too and I want to try this this ... out on you I don't believe Don Lemon or any of these guys on the left in in the media the advocacy media is trying to stop the Trump agenda they don't believe\nThat Americans who believe who who feel the way we feel about the sovereignty of our country proudly saying you you better believe were national is they don't believe we're racists they don't believe we're beginning they don't ... that ran the semi just a way to chill the debate\nKnow what they believe they believe all those bad things about you if you say nothing\n[laughter] just just by existing\nBy existing your existence is under French to them and they said this one insane\nProfessor at Georgetown a woman\nWho tweeted joined the Kavanaugh fight that all the people who favor all the men who favor ... defending gang rape has noticed that she's now\nDefines who he is on her courage deserve to die and the feminists should stand watching them choked to death and then cut off their penises and feed them to hawks this was literally a tweet from a professor at Georgetown\nWell that that is that that's that that that's\nThe arrangement which leads people to throw a Boulder to Kevin McCarthy's office window that's been a range well which leads people to think that they can go into a restaurant\nAnd verbally abuse the majority leader he was Senate whose life by the way is the secretary of transportation and she was with him for dinner that night I mean we need to understand you have a ground shirt to call a terrier mentality on the left\nAnd if they can shut you and me up by calling us bad my name's they'll do it every day\nThe great Newt Gingrich

look at the list of accomplishments of the last twenty months they under Lee ignore it they totally and completely ignore the economic boom like you listed I mean you you go down these major accomplishments of getting north and South Korea at the to to the table of of of of all the trade policies\nTo the table of of of of all the trade policies of the stuff that we've seen that has impacted people in their pocket book the lowest unemployment in the history of the country for black Americans for Hispanic Americans\nThese guys to a person they ignored each and every one of those accomplishments if they hated Trump because of his tweets or his personality or his style I get that I I I I can understand a push back\nBut you but you can't do it in a vacuum and you can't do it\nWhile ignoring the things that are of impacting millions and millions of Americans these policy achievement that we as conservatives had been dreaming about for decades\nWell I think first of all these people don't care about the evidence they have made a judgment that they have to find their life around is the worst thing that could happen to them\nWill be for Trump to be a great success because they are dedicated to believing that he has to fail\nAnd of course you know you you see it as I mentioned earlier earlier this up when you're in great historic periods you have these kinds of changes right or when Jeff when the Jeffersonian is one of the federal is literally died out by Eighteen twelve or so or when Jackson won the anti Jacksonian hated him so much\nThat he did not get a good biography until Nineteen forty five over a hundred years later because the the week the aristocracy wouldn't tolerate writing nice things are ... um the Lincoln one people forget how bitterly divisive\nWho fought a civil war over it\nUh and and and that's the one he was he was described as fast man by conservatives who wouldn't even say is late and the Al Smith who had been the Democratic presidential nominee in Nineteen twenty eight left the Democratic party in Nineteen thirty six because what is now too liberal than FDR Dennis procedure\nBut he's is concluded that FDR gone too far to the soil and you go through periods of this kind of change\nYou're going to see some people switch in that direction of the change agent and some people forming sort of a fossilized ... and that's what the anti Trump preserve becoming they're not only fossilized remnant of a group a group that used to be dynamic and now it just sits in the corner and ... and says better things\nAnd you know you talk about the ... that they are defined by trying to prevent his success arguably he's been an enormous success you look twenty months into this presidency\nAnd and you see the accomplishments on the judiciary you see what's happened with the court with the Supreme Court on down\nThe economy foreign policy domestic Newt it's not it's not a stretch to say we've just seen an enormously successful twenty ... twenty months of the Trump Administration is that is that fair\nYeah look I think I think that you do that Louis now again if you're a liberal and says this is where it's a little hard to understand and never accomplish and if you're a liberal having the most successful\nConcert with the judge process in history right literally in history better than Reagan better than I was now are better than it's nobody's business got gotten this far as the chefs\nAre but if you can certainly that's an amazing a cheap care objectively\nAbout the economy having the lowest black unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history I mean the best overall record us and I think fifty years\nUm those things out to be seen as pond snakes and and you have to say at some level the skies succeeding but if you remember Trump or you can't say that\nYou're not you can't because it ruins your own your credibility they they they feel that that that would destroy their own\nRelevance

I Know this is going to be tough for you but thank you for joining us today\nThank you thank you very much for having me\nLast night thank you thank you very much George for having me\nI Want you to tell or means you know audience that will truly be very sympathetic with you tonight exactly what happened to row because this story to important for so many people to understand\nA much start let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes for Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City he was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... or ... G. L. A. and the generic version of it that ... this is a black box drug\nThat was used as a first line of defense for something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see it begin to deteriorate who's ugly and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like distilling this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ross took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early and twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt he was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow was he just he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful but on the last attempt ah he used a gun and at that time\nI wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marking over a year but the tax came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we're going to talk about tonight these ... cities that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd uh you was it was shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... my biggest nightmare of course as a parent\nTo lose your child before before you go in a could only what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started she'll tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty two which is the name of your\nBook [noise] well I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I've found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nI Want to tell our audience does little to criticize the year when I was talking with Jonathan several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now you mentioned that you don't use roles\nUm was you know just a delightful young guy and use the name ... of course you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph's middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt the universe and no one is and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um has brought me significant meaning\nAnd on I was talking to Jonathan and I said my dad's name was ... you know he was born on December twenty seconds which\nAnd uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph was born in these weird ... he started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up an and everything else\nDo you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession in ab aiding [noise]\nAnd with the pain of what happened it began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute there's just got to be more\nAnd I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study a I've been studying the ancient ... text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world and I do\nBelieve that in finance is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not just\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say you must you in a very\nStrange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out there somewhere a in trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] [noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a while sometimes it's a little more frequent uh about two weeks ago I've been wearing his watch that I gave him on his twentieth birthday\nWhich is an automatic watch okay and I've been wearing it\nFor the better of course of a year and a half [noise] I've not touched it it always keeps the correct time ten days ago I woke up I put on the watch I got in the car I went to work and my watch was twenty two minutes\nBehind all I got to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men\nAnd do you get behind the car and you look at a license plate and you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a word for myself out of coincidences I'm calling them coincide and says\nBecause as a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number just two twenty two\nGenes random they just give it to correct you you didn't request it [noise]\nBut I don't think it's random I'm I have removed random from my thought\n... yeah I mean there might be random on the hotels side but somebody else who's directing this and the stock better Jonathan stay with us we're going to come back in the mall but didn't talk more about these strange synchronous cities of course a you've got some more stories to share with us we'll also open up the phone lines for a couple of reasons\nFor folks who want to just ask you a question about what you've been going through specifically this drug situation as well then of course

with us again as website in the need to twenty two dot com when it goes to the dot com targeting leaders were gold in twenty two like rural rural tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how this was a tragedy or how were you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really help to me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat'd you think of the afterlife prior to this is happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nJohn of the goals really didn't get to the second book three strains your courage that occurred I Want to go through each one explained to us what happened tell us about the drivers which went out there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it off and I looked\nAt him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloon what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday and went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing and she and then you had an occurrence with some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me and turn the lights back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the\nLights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house and just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked that many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I have struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWhile they're they're protected by law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was roles subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nKid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask is friends they would portray just the most honest I'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay at home they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood without with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\n[noise] [noise] well I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for you Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to the sink and it's nice that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we can look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born and from there the synchronous cities\nJust roll in um um we were both\nBorn nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight in every number we have to do it this is not a nine I mean ... fourteen or a seven or its divisible by seven\nYeah I'm sure you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well uh you know first thing was we noticed my initial PR his therapy um his mom's name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don\n... answer Dr parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the air and the month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\nPenny let me ask you if I can why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on the sixteenth birthday off okay okay uh it was it was better for him and me I understand that happened\nThat way and I mean it was it was excruciating let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one of ... out of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther and it's to me is is he still with us\nOh absolutely okay yeah I Lived with\nMe for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah and um we were both born on air force bases hay in than this hatred that cities and\nTheir beyond coincidence so ... when ours was done we're like astrological star twins\nIt's uncanny in winter again John what you call coincidence\nI call them coincide and says I I Believe that we all have these we just have to tune ourselves into them\nNo question the reality now you know there are things is I don't believe in coincidence is either I think the steps and then things have a purpose and the reason a sure sometimes there's luck and strange occurrences but I think by and large there are no coincidence isn't at all", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "26"}
