[noise]\n\n\nAnd we'll come back to ... with us author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley a former investment banker with UPS in New York He's world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness is not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book an end to upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and your use on goes to goes I've got this really shocked you wouldn't is Shelley Moore didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on I'm looking forward to this too I always ask\nQuestions of gas scientists and\nPeople who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not know the pure sciences June the medical professional folks mark would always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies Udall goes with it\nAnd I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago filling the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with a self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that's the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone\nThat when you think about meaning in life if you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there's no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned and narrow science and most of science today\nKnow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a back saying that you would write a book about consciousness how the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nIt was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nUh but I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of that her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities\nThe ability for consciousness to survive bottle he got things I had no familiarity with\nAnd overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives on reality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that processes consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of\nIntense research because I Need to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish\nTime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I I told people about it and the reaction was I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four\nDay weekend and I said okay\nLet me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than\nHalf of the book that's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a whole email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents that car totally\n... cheaper you know wash 'em and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary\nExisting yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nThat would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body\nSo one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just a host nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in the near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back into their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast dot com the name of his book we're talking about an end to upside down thinking me or read the subtitle\nDispelling the myth of the brain produces conscious just and the implications for everyday life we're going to take phone calls next hour with mark and I'm going to come back we'll talk with them about\nSound like a nice is free cognition so let's see how that all works outside of the brain and what's causing\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members is great for show up the didn't connecting those are good at ... dot

dot com ... ... ... is is with us right now as we talk about his work in into upside down thinking\nMark ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people that the evidence that I was referring to people parked out and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before ... put the pre cognition ... a psycho couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics on science fiction I had no idea there was actual science they controlled study that haven't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each other\nAnd ... study that haven't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about the weapons what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time you voted her entire career to investigate you to look at me and she came she came out with so much sounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's it's mine too my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like telepathy and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well up to the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experiments hers and when you combined the results\nThe statistics are very compelling and Dr dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds that that that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the ... experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experimenter is an experimenter say Jane I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow the ... the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nSure is that it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they text you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase at ... at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender having much to do with it\nI I I think that the receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ... communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think\nWe'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic then we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be the more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very\nBut studies in uh the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and use psychic spies for national security purposes many of them have been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world if I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me\nAt least made me question things um even further than that there's a page on science panel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these ... studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they say no we stopped because they would have kept us on they would've used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of blindness studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people\nIn their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react they don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre technician known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a creek pocket dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "10"}
