scans the frequencies it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes and clear it just continually sweeps\nAnd again that that's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick sparse moments as its scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of these cold springs box which is throwing the exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex so eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequency did you come across anything strangers shelves\nWhile I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that\nEven somebody like John de who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and and as a result created what magicians called the ... language that that use of a scene stone is the same as using a radio to communicate with the sphere world that\nThat this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic the vice some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and the material world in a way that\nSome would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers would probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true you to be with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book was Jewish mythology and legends roaming the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and in the U.S with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the call them as it's called particularly the column of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it\nIt there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep in one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder\nAnd a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dust sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate and it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine\nThere's a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal of them and the he says to them well what can I Do tend to speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nHere what about the showman you well you know you need a ... ah American tradition and other types of was a culture change ...

kinds of mechanisms to try to introduce the state of consciousness and their people and I think that what the shah and does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience said so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in chapter ... we watch it in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance\nI think it's something that we have long been excited about I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... sure experience isn't it\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build ... machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists to rationalize\nAnd it's not that they were the funky because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want to see him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found where Charlotte but his which he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where let's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves\nAnd ... those who do you mean by the way you do write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... gonna be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nOf right if he had two days equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you sort of\nA you know move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter rub uber goal his book strange

own\n... material destiny I mean it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist max favor used to talk about you know Protestantism in arid of capitalism that how about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that\nBy being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American often\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm going to do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with the spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and read purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right just another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nI could we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that\nUm I tend to ah believe though that we have to be careful about how much we try to rest\nThat you know from that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are like this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a bit a profit was somebody who has special information for us\nAnd now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working with these themes considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't against and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nSouthern effect and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can fix about technologies in ways that that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't know on the radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to you mentioned Peter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you never went online like that's listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr but my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right time to receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritualism\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual as it was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and\nPeople called medium spiritual mediums spiritual\nTelegraph [laughter] they really believe\nThat there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iran has really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah it is the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company\nThey actually\nThey this is how they advertise their television this is what they said the dreams of witches have come\nTrue oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate shepherd VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled\nTo the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just using it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dump that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk all radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wooden furniture\nAnd had silicone written across it uh you know it was it was a piece of art in the same we have TVs in the in the stereos up and started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about\nIs about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states are in ... states when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and told me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but that we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers\nThere's a movement of what's called trans humanism and hosts humanists who believe that we will become so merged with technology that that we will become the new spirit world", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "31"}
