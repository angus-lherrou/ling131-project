good night to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate we would just wrapped up in New York wow and what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action or some big notable Tony Blair form of a prime minister of England spoke bond Ki moon from the United nations\nUm actor Hugh Jackman\nWho the man the Wolverine\nSpoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached and three hundred news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears\nIf we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well I have never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nIsrael pollution we need to fix that is\nCorrect but I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd uh you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide\nLike mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I like to say to them what the cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\n... it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they ... it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that\nThe earth was warming and humans were causing that he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European\nCommunity sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that the world's kinda jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much\nOf this as being driven forward by momentum by ...\nThink of much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money [noise]\nUh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations and there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nBut you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee governor of Washington state\nJust to post an article on CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a center say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work\nUm the way we take care of our forests ah for example\nAre you concerned ... that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that you know the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change he bloody hands\nWhen I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\nWell if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what was Hurricane Florence\nAnd last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas\nA we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book

E. each am dot com ... room\n... new version of the ... you know ... ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nSure well that's this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business\nThis is an businesses and um one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the title was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there\nThey are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first of the four horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction\nUh and the fourth is a resource depletion\nThose for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy [noise]\nUm I and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort Worth ... and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries\nOr energy materials agriculture a et cetera but it's fun to read it say a color paperback and a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a\nEight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper\nBy the way for size it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but they're not going to put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore weeds climate change with what's happening I'm I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you gone\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago\nMay be it could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in ... abiotic oil that the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way too as a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\nOn who you know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that is pumped on this planet each way way down there oh yeah and in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the bottles of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise] but they didn't uh\nWe had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the\nFertility rate is a number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half\nYou were cultural into a industrial and then a technological\nA sort of a state we have more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families so all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years\nAnd so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd a benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and fill you in a driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere he said was this ... in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at how homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dump to everywhere pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum\nBut yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\nBut ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills a that piqued about Nineteen Ninety eight in the United states and then as now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um\nBut uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before um\nNitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food that's right\nOr the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three is enough and those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our aim set the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you've talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... ...\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer and Australia um\nWe had a a Scott Morris and uh take over as the uh the new a\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up in Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier Doug Ford took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar contracts they eliminated I'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric cart credit", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day":
