what I what I was to the whole range of electronic voice phenomenon I mean the earliest researchers weren't using radios they were using white noise they were used in just a quiet room with a microphone it was it wasn't so much about that that the vice itself it was the fact that it was electronic\nMedia it was making is possible some record about media whether it was a tape 'em or next case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people\nDo not react to that little angel ... shoulder which ... year telling them don't do this ... here straight stop you have to be able to\nDetermine when to do these things right mhm because if you don't you could miss a great opportunity where you could get killed or something like that and put out\nAbsolutely and how do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experienced that maybe you know maybe sometimes we project\nThe famous from within ourselves on to

it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about\nThese these specific thing I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography\nBut I wanted to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing so take up you know some of the important background information but yes it where it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand that that\nNo matter how you want to approach the subject whether you want to approach them to the skeptic or as a full on believer or the way that I liked to approach them more as a journalist and historian\nThat people are worried when you bring up or it's like ... for natural are called they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or\nIf you're coming at it from a from a way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with these subjects that all\nPoses problems sometimes when I'm

medium trans what happens\nIf Arthur Ford was a trance medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which\nProvides than there would be well she's like was was he liked Whoopi Goldberg ... in a post\nThat he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep\nOkay like like Casey All right\nAnd a blindfold and goes asleep okay like like Casey\nAll righty goes into that trench\nRight he just goes into a trance state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later she doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses\nAnd in one of them he contacted Houdini some other part of the year before this\nAnd then he starts having these than says and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back\nTo him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side a\nOne word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but again it was sharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one that's\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back to come back to him [noise] so this was an ingenious code really because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wow\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody knew what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nPerson to skiing\nRight here with us the sky apologist you had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nShe was that's true so\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think you would have had a movie um ... you know mogul yeah Hattie survive he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nRussia cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was\nGoing to use it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know with successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact comfort professor bash his wife's\nBest was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died\nAnd bass was um she had developed some well I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and after a\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine\nWhen the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was dark yes\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending\nMoney like a grows on trees she just\nHearing left nice little so\nYeah he left her a part of the uh they paid double a condemned lady or whatever for his ah\nInsurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money though\nRight probably that's close to a million dollars um so they doubled that because they said it was an\nAccident because it's got punched him and\nSo it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got fifty thousand so she was rolling and do you know and then she they put it all in the market and she'll off at all\nNo you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the current\n[noise] now Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was\nWe had a three part show the first part of the show was magic mhm\nThe second part was skipped college scape would do an escape\nThat was where the water or Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can skate and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have had this um confrontation with them punch the option\nSelf like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during the third part you would go out to a palm reader of somebody or a or that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he go in and find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that\nGoes in the dark or sometimes the I found it I got you you know and\nThen they're probably a string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium sort of just what a what do you do that I didn't I have nothing to do it that\nWell they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician than a magician always have what you call it out on the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods\nOn how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch the next one\nAnd and at work so you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in the states of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there you know and if all that failed and it couldn't get the T that would come out and kiss him and she got the appropriate tea in her mouth\nOr in just spit it into his mouth exactly\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was the ... the same thing for the spiritual spirituals because he had an agent and she would go into town and she would find some or hanging fruit she would\nFind some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't find what they're doing French couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from the need for clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini at a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere put the curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor where we're at a break but we'll come right back and talk about the curse that killed\n... forget to watch your GD show beyond belief with George

we'll also talk about magic very shortly as well professor back to the curse you were talking about the Marjorie and Houdini and explain a little bit more about who Marjorie was\nOK I'm Marjory I'm Nina crying and she was a socialite in Boston she was married to a doctor\nAnd they kind of mysterious life she was to be really sensuous lady\nAll the pictures I see she looked pretty average but everybody met her she was just devastating like beautiful I don't know why they probably have some do it the way that she\nUh and uh it had probably have something to do with the way that she did her say on a mean it\nWas that they called her Marjorie and she was the which applying street sometimes they called her the blonde which of Boston\nAnd complement in those days ago some of the year which\nI think so I think [laughter] I think they uh\nThey got a big kick out of it 'cause I was a lot of people during that time period during the spiritual is movement\nUm a lot of people are having families circles they were all kinds of people that were Catholics are Baptists or whatever on their on their Sunday afternoon or a Saturday they weren't all get together in the middle of the day and holding hands and somebody would go into a trance and they would try to contact their\nThe feast relatives it was a common back in the twenties\nOkay but the Kurdish\nRights so up here he goes and then he's going to check out mean a ... and he's going to go to Boston and they line up about six San says that he's going to attend\nNow the Scientific American has a twenty five hundred dollar per se for anybody that can prove that they are a real medium\nOr any normal and a kind of like the J. R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never end\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] I'm like you know that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving the money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the uh the Scientific American has the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory he's saying on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em rose Mac and burn that's the agents that easily sent ahead what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he builds this box and he has um James Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in her hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get at anything so who d'nese gotta make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they ah do one ... and everything goes according to plan and uh they have what they called ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the way I ... the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now\nAh and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini lax so there's no way anyone could get at it well in the first say on the bell rings so the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it\nAnd they put that and the second say on the bell rings\nSo now he's got a fixture in ... we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching ... Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her\nHow he's you know exposed her so he's got this book is going to put out so he has to expose her so she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the sands\nAnd of course Marjorie\nHas a spirit guide and his name is Walter and its Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini\nAnd he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nAnd this was just saying that's right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because inside the box is a ruler one of those rulers pulls up into three pieces\nYup is one of those all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini and a James Collins\nHow was the curse and then we ended up dying\nWell ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year and that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nMan died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nCould die at any moment\nYeah and it really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nSick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor 'cause he doesn't\nHe doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kinda my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to him\n[noise] Arthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he I'll live Houdini he outlive all ah she lived until Seventy one oh wow okay Hartford poured\nLived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he doesn't and you've got these photos of Marjory flags under the\nTable and then he had some drawings made where her latest reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that dry oh\nTrickery by Houdini\nYes so Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with John injure and then he worked with ... and he makes a statement and there's a a a bomb shelling and the interviewed crafting\nAnd he gives this quote buy gifts and it says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the medium he purported to expose wow that's pretty heavy that is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting\n'em ... James Collins in there and that uh the rose Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three park show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done professor if they had television in those days\nA boy you would have been you know the fiery\nUh brings up another a subject you know a set on San says and you wonder why people don't put a stance on TV really well I was involved in a a\nYou also if you live in multiple personalities Muslim used in weather reports and the vegetables will deal to the parents around ... you want to find the best deal on and you are used part student right here and checked it out\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] we've\nGot the best tar deals you\nKnow [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut did you know when you donate stuffed good will you help provide job training for people right here in your community\nFighter nearest donation centered goodwill dot org\nA message from goodwill in the ad council\nTargeting birthright citizenship I'm Carmen Robert Fox news the fire storms brewing over whether President Trump can do with automatic citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants\nThis whole thing started when President Trump made comments during an interview with actually is that's part of a new H.

that Houdini was in the Detroit River when he was in town before he died was he not professor\nYeah I think I think that was one of ...\nProfessor\nYeah I think I think that was one of his one of his escape\nYeah you really weren't they dumped him in the ... river I think he was in a straight jacket upside down\nYeah that you love doing that and sometimes he was in a box Houdini would uh he would modify his escapes to whatever of you know kind of businesses that wanted to support him\nSo uh you know if the police supported him he that's scape from\nOne of their jail cells a there was one tiny escape from a like big fish they built the big fish 'cause I was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their town so he would he would\nIt kind of ingenuity fleas he would make up some way to escape from something that tied in to his advertisers\nTony Curtis died in the twenty five years old but I thought he did a great job in that movie you remember\nYes yeah I think all of the movies have been actually pretty good yeah ah I don't they don't stick with the actual\nHow did how did he make that elephant disappear in the ... in London how did he do that\nWell can you want me to tell you\nYeah you know the I mean what did he how did they have the thing covered or or what first of all\n[noise] ah no I Can't tell I'm not going to tell 'em come on smile I might tell you on private

going to ask you if you question okay that's did he have any apparatus that raises the elephant from underground\nYou know you did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\nYes okay\nWe'll do a little more homework yeah they do\nKnow who comes up with the tricks I mean was this Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trek\nAnd let's do this and we can make this how did they do this same with hockey puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly um James Collins when the guy that Houdini the built all I'm form like Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walk in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then they're shrouded in cloaked in or something and then the trick began I mean it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he\nProbably the same queen that's there and [laughter]\nYou know in Europe but I don't think she was there okay I'd I don't know for sure next on it I don't think she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\n... let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis I'm Ralph go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away things\nUh I knew or for oil and his last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died that ah seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found them\nQuestion for you or what what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini\nThis was in Nineteen twenty nine okay it was a three part code or the code was middle\nSection first word was rows and rows and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe\nAnd then she had Dr words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his coded gotten through\nNow did he she later denied that later on a after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward Said comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nI fell in love again yeah so\nYou didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her what he promised to her that\nShe can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead real\nWhat year than they cheat deny that the the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct uh she says she was told that she never denies that\nShe says she was told that she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages\nShe having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math\nDepression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nA art before it was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing your just pleasure for that then Edward think comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on\nAnd about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket years\nYeah he made them what John a couple of movies that bleach Disney\nWell Houdini make four or five movies yeah and they also I Hope they do they do well\nUh they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThat they he was an actor and he always had like a really really good luck and co star\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes\nHe was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden muffin guy he was only in everything kind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes in all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nMhm yes and that's Eric turned into Harry and then who guinea he got from Don and he had it and I called Houdini\nAnd er so to this day they called him Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever a sweatshirt name and he was born in uh Europe you know he wasn't born here and he was\nHe was born in Hungary\nYeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't even actually a U.S citizen

want the trick to fail or succeed what do you think\nWell I think they all want it\nTo succeed I think you'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nOr some people who

know I'm I'm also fascinated I don't know if you've looked at ... piece Electra Toronto Boyce phenomenon where a whole chapter in a book about\nHer family perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more of these recordings\n[noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank function in the nineties figure it out that if you hack\nI'm ... in the nineties figure it out that if you hack\nA digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes in clear it just continually sweeps\nAnd again that that's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture and these very quick\nSparse moments as its scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with was a imagine has the spirit world\nHe came up with one cold springs box which throwing the exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex\nHe'll eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strangers ...\nWell I did some experiments and you are a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John\nThe who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language that that use of a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the spirit world that\nThat this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic device some material device where we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes\nA kind of spiritual hacker where we're really trying to interact with\nOur technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers we probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legend surrounding the goal and tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and and view it with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the column of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it\nIt there's chaos ensues the rabbi could no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep that one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder\nAnd a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles and ... sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways or\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate and it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine\nThere is a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal I'm In the he says to them well what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no I Can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures and so\nWe can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nYou know what about the Sherman says well you know Native American tradition and other types of was a culture change ... seemed to be the person connected to the other side\nAnd then also seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the ... would also use utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the state of consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... does and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirits habits and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience said so I don't think that it's necessarily or we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in ... we want to if in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we've long\nAnd excited about it I mean even watching a a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a shop and aesthetic sure experiences knit\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists rational it\nAnd it's not that they were the funky ... because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother but he couldn't find all he found or Charlotte but his which he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment for ten even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and ...\nThose are new Houdini by the way you do write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy what do you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something [laughter] maybe\nBut I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you sort of you to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most\nQuickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter rub uber goal his book strange frequencies we got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easier for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nTo the cheaper natural and stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour will even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions\nMore to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology in its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCaused insiders the new version of it goes to ... a a map you know Dr bone and know Android ... listen Leiber on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human quest to take control of our own\nEra troll material destiny I mean it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist max vapor used to talk about you know Protestantism in arid of capitalism that have been about the Protestant American there it is something whereby we want to\nProve our right now is we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I ...\nOr by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American often\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm going to do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with the spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something the pre existing eye opening it up and read purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practice magic for millennium right\nJust another example of magic of\nA of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nI could we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it on the Internet is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are but this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us\nAnd now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working with these teams considered to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology is the ... and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio and I'm going to re sawed or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible\nAnd the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place the science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't it yes and yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nIt's underneath it and divorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't know on the radio or have a computer where you can listen online and somebody came up to you should Peter ... are you is this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's alter he's out there and you of course who never had a radio you've never went online like that's listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr what my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions a year they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to do the right time to receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual\nWell it's fascinating that you say that because when spiritual is a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology\nPeople called medium spiritual mediums spiritual\nTelegraph [laughter] they really\nBelieve that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special and new kinds of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were spirituality and technology tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself has kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah yeah the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they this is how they advertise their\nTelevision this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird but to increase\nSense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right\nUm and so the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate shepherd VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk go radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was engaged in this beautiful piece of wood furniture\nAnd had syllable written across it a ... ... it was it was a piece of art in the same we TVs in the in the stereotypes that they started coming out with\nThe Chinese are meant to be central pieces of our home right

than anything and what I liked about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous\nStates are in ... states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regard to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to

where a whole chapter in the book about\n... percent perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more of these recordings\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to\nUse digital radio is to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figure it out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that does that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station when the signal comes in clear just continually sweeps\nAnd again that that's that can\nOr just continually sweeps and again that that's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise and again people will write these words down that they will capture in these very quick\nSparse moments as it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with what they imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with when it's cold springs box which is the exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he\nBecame more and more complex he'll eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nOr as you were putting together strange frequency did you come across anything strange ...\nWell I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John de who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using a radio to communicate with the spirit world that\nThat this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some medium mystic device some material device\nWhere we take something and we purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers\nWould probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nThat's true Peter ... with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legends rumbling the Golan tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and and view it with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the call him a Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um who are being attacked\nOr there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it or you have to put it to sleep in one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder\nAnd a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into ... sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate man it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal um itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful ... story where\nA rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal of them and the says to them well what can I Do tend to speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nHere what about the showman you well you know you Native American tradition and other types of was a cultures the showman Olson seemed to be the Persian connected to the other shot\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also used in utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states of consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... does and what the stage magician does in many ways is is very connected and it also connects us\nIn many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access it connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which\nPeople were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet but they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience said so I don't think that it's necessarily or we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be in ... we watch is in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we belong and excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a shopping is that sure experiences knit\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was ever able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we're people who are considered scientists the rational\nAnd it's not that they were the bunk and because they wanted to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth is this true Houdini\nHoudini really wanted him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his eerily departed mother but he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his which he believed that it would be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where let's just for a moment pretend even if it's just the pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and ...\nThose are new Houdini by the way you do write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done to our tone right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy what do you as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had today's equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were using these things but if you sort of\nYou to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really wasn't as magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter rub uber goal his book strange frequencies we got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nTo the super natural and stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology in its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCaused insiders the new version of it goes to ... am Abu no available for iPhone in no Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human quest to take control of our own\nSpiritual material destiny I mean I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist one in particular max vapor used to talk about you know Protestantism and the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right\nAnd I think that that it tends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing some\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it and\nSo I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right just another example of magic of a\nOf a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool I\nCould we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer that maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get ... [noise]\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean ...\n... you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are but this goes you know back to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who has special information for us\nAnd now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual are are often considered outsider artists why is that why is that people were working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's\nWe live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this somebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when I re solder a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect hate plays\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store\nWhich said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't it yes and yet we can take the thing this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that is underneath the scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's\nSouthern effect and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to a huge Peter ... voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit ... strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you never went online like that's listen you're probably seeing what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr but my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to do the right time to receiver\nWhile it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual\nTelegraph [laughter] they really\nBelieve that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special a new kind of receiver and transmit are and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq his really augmented\nBeing from the television Iraq his really augmented in shape things were ... in technology tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself has kind of a ... very strange and scary oh yeah yeah the some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they this is how they advertised on\nTV this is what they said the dreams of which is has come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right [noise]\nUm and so the the fact that you know we that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in that when we were used to watch you ate shepherd VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we talk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight that's the way but ah ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yep\nMy dad had an old silk all radio in this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was engaged in this beautiful piece of wood furniture and ... co written across it\nUh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same way or the TVs in the in the stereos others started coming out with\nThe fact is meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poultry guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live in a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous\nStates are in ... states that when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical than somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regard to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will

slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was a Hungarian born American the illusion is stumped performer noted for\nHis sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S\nAnd that is Harry handcuffed Houdini on a tour of Europe where he challenged police forces to keep it locked up\nSunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath inside of sealed milk Ken what's the water at\nNinety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups commissioned by London daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour and another ... buried alive only just able to claw himself to the surface or birds you know the state of near break down\nNow what many suspected that these escapes were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge or fix spiritual as he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her\nHe was not successful he told his wife bash that when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back Harry Houdini died on October thirty first Halloween Nineteen twenty six in Detroit Michigan\nYou know die from this punch a lot of doctors nowadays say he just died at ... night is from a ... so it's the battles\nRage on and on and what really killed him and it goes back and forth but I think he was had the onset of a a pen to fight if and when he was hit it actually broke\nThe bus or train all the bacteria comes out and rent money\nRight and they had no antibiotics\nRandy\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had stuck in seven days to die\nWho do you have little substance is that what happened\nYes yeah it was a parrot might so it saps assault through they had two operations and then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work during those seven days he had\nTime to go over this afterlife experiment that she and ... worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds of since before Nineteen Thirteen\nThey had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if one of them died that they would um use this code contact each other\nAnd so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget what the medium trans what happens\nIf aren't the report was a tramp medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory I'm you know the er which ...\nFrom ... and she's like was was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a ...\n... he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep\nOkay like like Casey all righty goes into that trench\nRight he just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later he doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time when it happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses\nAnd in one of them he contacted Houdini some other about a year before this\nAnd then he starts having these than says and he starts getting the code now the Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back\nTo him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side a one word or something\nYou're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but again it was sharper than that who he said listen I'm over in the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one that's\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him so this was an ingenious code really because it's take it's a ten it's like\nFifteen words wow\nWhy why would Hillary professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody knew what was going\nWell or as you know Harry had to be first\nPerson to ski\nRight here with us as Scott pollock just to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane in Australia\nShe was that\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that\nSo uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career you know mogul yeah Hattie survive he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nRush cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was\nGoing to do was going to do and do you think it was successful\nI I Know ... all I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact didn't comfort professor bash his wife's\nBest was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she\nUh while he was alive and after a while he was alive and after he died and so\nYou remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her\nShe came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was vested stock market yes she\nLoses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like it grows on trees she just\nHearing Lester nice little so\nYeah he left her a part of the uh they pay double a\nCondemned lady or whatever for his ah insurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money that\nRight ... public that's close to a million dollars um so they\nDouble that because they said it with an accent because it's got punched him and so it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen\nYou can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got fifty thousand\nSo she was rolling in do you know and then she they put it all in a market and she'll often at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the current\n[noise] now Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was magic the second part was skipped college ... skates he would do an escape\nThat was where the water or Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual less than he would have have this um confrontation with\nThem launched himself like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party he would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a a that he considered fake and you'd go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he go in and you'd find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent\nDown that goes in the dark or sometimes see I found that I got you you know and\nAnd they're probably string or something like that\nRight so ... and of course the the medium to adjust what are what are you doing that I didn't have nothing to do that well they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call it\nOut the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch the next one\nAnd and it works so you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in the states of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in

R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never had the\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate\n[laughter] um well they're all white you for that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving the money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the ah the Scientific American have the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory say on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em rose Mac and ... that's the agent that easily sent ahead what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box and then he has um James Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get at anything so Houdini gotta make sure that she can't produce any trickery so they are doing one say aren't everything\nGoes according to plan and ah they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box and if they push on the ... the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of mean\nA and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack so there's no way anyone could get out well in the first say on the bell rings so the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it\nRight and they put ... and the second say on the bell ring\nSo now he's\nSay on the bell rings\nSo now he's got a fixture in ... we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her how he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out so he has to expose her\nSo she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the sands\nAnd of course Marjorie\nHas a spirit guide and his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother\nSo Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nEvery now and this was just saying this right\nThis is the spirits saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because inside\nThe box is a rule or one of those uh rulers holds up into three pieces\nYup is one of those all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini and a James Collins\nHow was the curse a professor and then we ended up dying\nWell ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nDie at any moment\nYeah and really really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die\nSo later when Houdini gets sick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor 'cause he\nDoesn't he doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini he outlive all ah she lived until ... Seventy one oh wow okay Arthur poured\nLived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini or tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the\nTable and then he had some drawings made for her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like\nThat drawing oh\nTrickery by Deanie\nYes sir Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on guinea he worked with Houdini he worked with Don injure and then he worked with ... and he makes a statement and there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting\nAnd he gives this quote by Gibson says when will magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the mediums he purported to expose\nWow that's pretty heavy\nThat as heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ...
