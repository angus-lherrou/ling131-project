calling him the air\nAs we've heard from Dave polite us in the previous appearances you're on the program and the disappearance of that he has a\nFocused on have occurred mostly on land a lot of them on water and as we've all learned tonight some of them in the air so bill Collins might have been on to something maybe there is something in the air because if you were these cases are pretty weird when we come back though we're going to jump into some of the more recent research he's done about\nThere's nothing left of her family anymore\n\nYou have another a case in in the book about a land the parents that involves really smart person somebody who's um and and for what looks like great things his name is Steven read and his disappearance was in Nineteen Ninety nine in Oregon tell me about that one\nSo this is the one time out of the thousands of times where I read this case and I said you know\nGoing to go against my own protocol I'm going to call the parents\nAnd I'm Glad I did\nBut Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine to salmon Butte trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood and for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount ... around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old\nHe's an intellect super smart kid was a a third year medical student the reports\nI was a third year medical student reports come from the ... county sheriff and uh when he was twelve years old as a gift for his birthday he asked his parents for the book called Grey's Anatomy\nKind of tells you where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up\nYou graduated from college with a ... biology degree five data cap is soon become loud\nIt was accepted Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted internship to the Mayo Clinic in June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of his second year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years\nAnd he traveled to Oregon and check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure until the family wanted to see some wildlife mother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven\nOn June nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostels checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm Sorry paid Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth even called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them said he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third\nAnd he was seen at night in a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in that little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there essentially worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers saw Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nWell they executed the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out Rand registration on the run Iraq and the vehicle king backed registering to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left well\nSteven was return was supposed to return to trade on July second and parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nThey called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise] [noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland\nAnd the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and a theme that some assistance from the national guard Keenan since our teams\nSearchers faced rain and wet conditions for many of the days but again the searched and start for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything can Deborah dogs were later put into that area I never picked up ... percent\nThey uh they had a psychic approach them and the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second city needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there\nAnd they are hoping already said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStudying search almost two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task\nAnd right here I'll say that Carol Turner when she disappeared in her park she at least left left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out now I see the air\nIndicating when she was going to be out [noise] now I say the ... every conference and I said on every time on I'm On with you people need to carry a personal located became cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks a month for service fee and get 'em on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nWell a lot of things went wrong in this case a just a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but I you know a church that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you don't\nThink you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with 'em I doubt if you even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen or I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your like on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd I think that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic they got involved in this case have you ever employed disturbances of a psychic or have you ever in the end of decays were psychic was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\n[noise] tell your story is um is remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people and ask them if he had ever found anybody and he gave me the name of this person\nAnd I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hey did this person help you in finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on George\nI'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and and other remote viewing cases there was one guy at a conference with a ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote fewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics owners row at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduced myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help you want to help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them\nThe next week when I got back and I never got a response from when\nWe're talking with ... about his newest book missing for one one land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week yours or one of his best to be right back [noise]\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a plan vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the ... early they laugh early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and critically at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone\nAppears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep in California and left the link the voicemail strange found screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human found or their animal found or what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes um some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right\nBut some of those clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's a boy now unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nThere are two minutes worth of only one [laughter]\nVery little actual talking\nSo what are you concerned that the derby never will deny call came from Henry McCain cell phone it with labor date September Seventy two twenty eight in the morning McCain worried white hurting demented in hell for\n... minutes and then he didn't he certainly is a nonprofit agency and acting as that goes between but police in the Liberian community\nSuddenly they're trying to get help your family maybe some didn't rewarding\nThe walls someone's height [laughter] [noise]\nWell like moaning and have like ...\n[laughter]\n... silent then someone either Henry or another person than I think I Try to picture where he was\nLate at night I went back and and they\nWouldn't need him sound like that\nThe voice mail isn't stark contrast to other articulate recordings of Medicaid speaking at an event you just state auditor\n[noise]\nDimension is one of the evidence now you'd police are revealing didn't believe she tell me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and voices for clues did she says the investigation to get here on Tuesday\n[noise]\n'cause I think part which borders you write known un friendly all areas where Medicaid was reporting team or cell phones teams play yes you can only water control search they came up empty [noise]\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense have been have you ever seen any of that analysis reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion with that that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing that I've written about and pass books\nIs that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in the ... it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow laugh tower that they can that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nAnd many other cases I've written about in the past and missing for one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy man that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he was going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canine helicopters ground teams everything\nOn November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a kayaker was on rush wake one mile south east of the last time they cannot fall on the cell body in the water and they recovered it there was no violence at all to the body according to the corner\nThe termination on the count on a cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nThat one of the things that I presented and sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men\nWas that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy\nSeveral times when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim\nAnd they were an level so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it they pass out they realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never have any of their friends relative et cetera ... the point where they disappeared from time they disappeared amongst friends they couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B\nTeenage couldn't truck point to point water times that happened in the winter and there was no marks from the snow point the point [noise]\nIs it happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point and if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication if they placed you on the water you would die by drowning knock from G. H. B.\nAnd C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states it's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases\nBut it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat they're recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony\nAnd then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like you're somebody on there that says stop it that's um that's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street\nHe's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves\nIt's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies are bound and sometimes they aren't and they're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things unknown almost like no one gigantic bird is whooping down in matching them up\nUm you know so many\nWays is calling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this earlier I heard John this YouTube say this is\nI don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic\nBecause I'm not giving you any theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand is is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat they're a pattern say and um this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at triangles including one that's here in Nevada right\nUnfortunately [laughter] yeah how did you ever heard of that\nMy parents taught me that tomorrow is a promise to anyone that's why they each had life insurance to take care of the future I got my first policy when I was Eighteen now with your family be okay if something happened to you if you can buy last day you can buy life insurance it's about a portable joined me and taking care of our families futures at life happens that or\nA public service message from the nonprofit life happens\nCan we just enjoy the\nMarcia gay harden how did you get any are getting older it's not that it rains changing\n... do you think as you age relating\nAbout that but not me\nLearn how to help reduce some risks do you ... ... emails a\nLast minute and the deal is John I'm an Carrick Fox News Canada's prime minister called a cabinet meeting laid on Sunday and shortly after the U.S and Canada confirmed a new trade agreement was in place\nThe United states Mexico Canada agreement us MCA replaces the Nineteen Ninety four NAFTA packed\nThe Jerry agreement isn't this is the same as the Trans Pacific partnership trade agreement rejected by President Trump while steel and aluminum tariffs are not included exemptions on terrorists on two point six million cars is included NAFTA ...\nIt's prime minister calling it a good day for Canada\nCharles Chad letting ten a North Carolina State University associate professor says he used to interact with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when the two right yeah ... says Kavanaugh was often belligerent and aggressive when drunk this latest report could hurt the geo peas goal to confirm Kavanaugh\nYou just don't know what you don't know and you don't know which political impact maybe this is something that's not that big a deal I mean to hear a report if someone being too drunk and college and\nStarting a fight there was a lot of ah you know things like that that went on college dormitories and frat houses are nowhere is that written that that's necessarily disqualifying for the Supreme Court but it could be just a drip drip drip\nFox's chat program the meeting between the president and Rod Rosenstein of the Justice Department was delayed because of the Kavanaugh hearings Fox's ...

separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty [noise]\nHeard on the island of moral that's an island in Scotland fifty five years old I Gibbs was a war hero is an intellect and he was a pilot we've spent fires in the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn forced the hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a graph airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water [noise]\nHe arrived at the hotel on December twenty if on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the airstrip and asked if he could fly it\nFact the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it in Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater\nAnd on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay out the porches suit can fly inland so she exits the plane places the torches out in the field and he she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the lights went\nWell make a long story short gives didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers the search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six it was about four months after the disappearance\nGives his body is found on the north pole\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it\nNow if gives it jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell the corners stated the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia\nAnd I guess that he probably died two hours after takeoff well they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there really how long has he been dead where was the plane\nAnd then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain when people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die\nObviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain it away and saying people do weird things when hypothermia set then they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nHow would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would you sit here and it seemed to\nWell one of the things is I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of clothes\nAnd the person left the house and it was Seventy degrees out later that night it got down to fifty but the person left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone and they're in a\nStack in this field this has happened multiple times also I've had other cases where a parent says might be be couldn't take off their clothes so if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include try I Try to explain this rationally now there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the book you kind of stuff and that's fine but\nThe reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions deal I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous and there were there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes Ron backwards or she was missing or I'm against somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is which when they wake up in the morning\nI'm no there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of their cages that you have in your books where\nPeople clothing is founded kinda folded up it said it neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as if my best\nPlay somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as if by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special notes were made that\nThe clothing and the body was in packet bleak clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower and they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\n\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they've been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're out whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where did they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases\nWhen when the bodies of water it just certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink ring of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nQuarters that made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days where they were if they'd been for all this time\nAnd that's important for about ... finding a body especially water because it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or all harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just disregarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is\nAre these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body\nThat's not the case if they are found ... pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the full\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that yeah I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence my what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\n... when we first started district together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it may be some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about we've come a long way\nAnd I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't see really what made the obvious years later\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know maybe a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me I mean I think where we are today versus where it was six years ago in a huge difference\nWe're talking with Dave Chappelle I just missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm an open up the phone lines and you can ask David a couple of questions yourself we'll be right back\nUm and you know when we went um Mm came back out of the mountain um met up with a couple of other researchers and I'm One gentleman had found some future than the\nUm and they tried calling the nine one one on America thing I'm very fair to ask you and they never called back um and another lady um they were and that and now the flash at certain point\nI'm On there and they they tracked big on their own they could give it and um you know I I don't know ... and it was three page on my cell phone a an excuse me one of them getting make any sense was way off to the left of the way you park your car not even way the trail is um\nAnyhow um and it kind of thinking you know I've thought of what could be and I think he may be a portal to another dimension um they put they put my the guy with with and had some big foot a couple of times up in that area and I've seen a shift it's twenty five feet above ...\nAnd also an underground he could have obeyed I'm the only ran straight enough I'm On the back side of this now and it can create um at all for it and I don't know\nRick I'm only forty and I don't know any of it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that I'm live even mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like it but there's like a big fight before\nWell gee you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there who will get names reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I'm I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them but ... you can speak for yourself\nOr all all hit on one of those things are the cell phone hanging I wrote a about a case in Michigan several years ago and they track this guy's phone\nOver this area and according to the kings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times\nIn this pattern that he was supposedly track then and there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased\nIn an area probably where he should have been and where they were originally looking but it just like this lady said the kings didn't make any sense\nIt's probably more often than you are here and everyone kind of just left it off and says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good there's some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because and now they only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation as to how it got their\nFirst time caller Brent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\nThank you very much for taking my call what's on your mind\nTo question for David you've talked about how uh people when they have come\nThey haven't remembered anything that's happened to them so I Wonder if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there's something about having their memory a race that also you've talked about the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious disappear does Germany if perhaps they're more common there\n\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race or you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and a vexing obstacle especially with kids that's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that will have the claims that and is willing to those are a lot a lot of hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taking their very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking mayor or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter wall put it in the article you know that's just the kids imagination the search for set well is it or is it not\nOh on the wild card line Carolyn North Carolina hello Carol\nMy I had a question\nIn their bodies they have recovered have they have it done enough autopsies to look very very small mark his needle mark or something that would be related to the tools of nanotechnology\nAnd I wanted to tell David teeth accent I'm sure one in the U.S government since Nineteen eighty two has had the ability to he'll make things invisible I Know that because a friend of mine\nA slew a experimental yet up to Washington DC over the White House and having the Pentagon undetected\nUm anyway\nWell that's interesting um they read there is some work on the visibility cloaking a devices and equipment and clothing even we had that discussion on the program before you ever gotten into that topic did\nYou know I I think you were the one that had the author of community along right yeah that that had some some real interesting things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and they ...\nThere's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and the practice when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that there is some kind of nanotechnology involved in any of these disappearances based on marks on the body that you've heard of\nSome corners do an autopsy they look for a needle marks that's one of the things that could be a contributing factor on deaf so they're looking for that for the first nanotechnology I don't know if they would be\nEast of the Rockies yawned again Virginia Hi John good morning\nI feel like David I'm [noise] I'm like well you tell us just on this personal stories that

Roger\n[noise] yes uh thank you George a mission that um I wanted to a related story to ah Mr polite is uh\nAbout a missing people uh in the uh Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that are over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body parts and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and ah [noise] and since uh during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a miss a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh [noise] you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and ah and because he's an adult to we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr a ... is a being aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers and and over there\nYeah I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you you know if you wanted to try to contact him we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a days I I Know he knows about the ... the story because it was a widely publicized your son\nUm what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\nOkay uh if it happened in Bellingham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened a ... and this happened two years ago October uh\nHe uh he had\nLeft home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been some friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently it ran out of cash and a and didn't have any money to get gas so he took off walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried calling his wife back and uh that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out and uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with uh with uh the law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones are I mean they're covered ah the area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed up for it and uh we were just show\nA broken over that uh\nAnd uh\nSince then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talked to a few times to some of the people that actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything at all after that so\nWell for that reason why yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe uh get uh\nWhy yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David this brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would suggest you try that website or that okay good it is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes away and the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\n\nA thank you Roger thanks for calling in would try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge I did a couple of season okay for two national parks a glacier and canal in Alaska and one thing I Would say uh especially looking at the rally the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that ... you can take a bus\nNo real hiking trails and if you go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be that hiking so\nI I I Would say it and I will call late to flip glacier ah they really on the play chess how treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty mile trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can do wrong ah and ah you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and couldn't feed\nA then I don't know anything can happen with the wild animals that would be one thing now I don't think\nUh what's happening as some sort of Charles Manson\nGroup that are looking to just five isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think that people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so I I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening\nUh but uh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail\nUh nobody would have no where I was at a one more thing on that is my ... theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I for one says it looked like something from ... park\nSo I Do wonder if that's the vote right there is some sort of ... historic bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they are criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know there are criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are rows and rows weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who vanished I'm under breed strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there is no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David ... books but uh I appreciate that thought or we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines of we'll get to do as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um\nBut I can understand how the elements skin and sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the or we're going to go to the break the ... taste take us into the break and we'll be right back\nOn a couple of weeks later because we're running out of their day and it never was never ever ever again you know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific creature or creature report but I Do know that the ... I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least in the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing\nBut no I hadn't heard this story about the the um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at room rock lake thanks for sharing that no appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how're you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um this evening a you guys were talking about David Paterson die you were talking about this couldn't walk around right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that it and I pointed at the radio because I've read all the books I've read all of the four one one books I've read the skin walk ranch book\nAnd I've been following this thing for some time for several years\nA ... was ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of disappearances\nAre a lot of this uh parents has happened on or near rich line and I just couldn't walk ranch that's on a ridge line\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taken no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows when ... somebody's on the property or on around I mean it's just to me I I'm just saying to me uh in my opinion I think that you know the the skin walk ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the the phenomenon surrounding the Fort one one\n[noise] well I you know I think there are some similarities and that the ... whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do with themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is their skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals or other here but not people\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of the um college marks on them either them scraped and things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do and you read a dachshund stories and things like that\nThat that that doesn't fit but as far as rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate a no one ever she sees it uh that that to me is uh some good strong march there but\n... thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with us and that's a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas or he has his id and he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome George are eight or ... for taking my call I lead you might\nBe my experience a sheer at a park in San Antonio which they added another channel miles up bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd now this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time almost nearly me and my wife were using a vice slowing down to chart the course I was a little ahead of her and uh we got through this one area where it got kind of dark even though it was daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe sun sunlight shining through as much as I started kind of got caught in the dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was that good on on the stump they look more like a bird\nOut but uh you know you never know I mean it's kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall ... feet\nAnd just to and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she vote and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it back a bit flying away but the wingspan was sold large it was a\nIt was like a regular bird you know I mean we have dogs and I'm going to send all kinds of stuff and I am a park nearby but\nGoes and all kinds of stuff but not in a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parts where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is\nAnd so I just wanted to share my story because I Know we didn't report it to know cops or or any park rangers they said well why don't we didn't have no evidence is too it's kinda hard to believe that there could be that the urge to do but just riding bikes than a a\n[noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall that have just like a regular birds they threw a do you remember what coloring on the animal are all you\nSaw was kind of like a maybe ... some things with his eyes Tyler glowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark Cold War or something like that you knew staring at you when you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really tell exact details that especially when there wasn't that distance and I I think the first thing you you I Know this was a sense that something was staring at me and that's why that's so it made me look\nAnd what not to my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so I so second\nShe turned around and just try to fly away so I couldn't really tell a bad like has the arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and the boots and stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story and none of that's kinda creepy stuff reshape the specific detail that you had on that uh wow that's quite an experience uh Jason in Portland, Oregon as inexperienced this year with a vision welcome\nFlow George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter]\nNo need your you're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had a lot of strange encounters in my life and I have a very rational go analytical brain that overrides things and so it wasn't until years later I started putting\nAll the facts together [laughter] and so the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\n[noise] that's basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time\nThey bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road\nAnd pile up a big mountain of the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again you can kind of hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the\nCoast range and it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down the trail and I ...

new book\nMissing for one one law L. A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raise the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished to dip into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and ... by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we've all here tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh\nMysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me in just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with the ... pressure on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nDon't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered him didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people\nThey came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks in jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back an attorney called this time it took and why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in Florida and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well you don't have any of us a missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keeping a list that each individual location or humans have listed headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less\nSo years ago somebody said well maybe you ought to just file a request and see how many rules of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that lists for me\nA couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lists I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because we still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards and every park and every jurisdiction they have\nLet them start accumulating the list and they can hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even responding wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you know but he believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're gonna charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nNo it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and we're going to explore maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your book the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read reports started making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue the canine ths can't find a set and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the farm team for a number of years our dogs had about Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours\nAnd it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a vet reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot the turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIs the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM\nMany of the victims have some type of a disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nThat's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I explained and many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them that point of separation something happens\nAnd that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nWas an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in this specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical clustering that I figured out why after I started putting pins in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in eleven other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of things happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nAnd say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\n\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cages and its men women did four to one ratio correct\nI any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors ... out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about ... latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck and the Beatles they ... into the break we'll be right back\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue parameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\n[noise] so that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the report that they generate and the national Park Service for one\nIt was about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was Eris she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you wanna fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nBut these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see and a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but\nThere's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law the reports have to be disclosed to the public tunnel crust\nColorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong\nTo what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specific to your the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the old story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird do explain\nKnow makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks heart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed in communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it I Can't explain it\nAnd every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office helped on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but\nAnd mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that but then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of cases you you sent me some information about one Samantha ... what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle she'd like to go to this a location a called ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there in August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean port of Suzanne\n[noise] round trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot gained going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top so I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet\nWell\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of a guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him he reacted the right way he went goal he went out and look for her\nWhile the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her up the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually published in the homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual dad cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because you're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance\nWith his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns are trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site and searching day and night\nWell then Shirley and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kind of gave him this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating the exact same effort that search and rescue stung before not a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they said that they haven't searched very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports of search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and ... you'll understand this George is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them\nYou've only cars could talk what would they say about the owners\nGet the ... over what do you mean oh he must be looking

A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raised the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment\nFresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it\nBut those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence of cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so what you're thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nBut worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down at an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured all week leading up to this date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training\nWell they came back and they said they don't carry any less and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks in jurisdictions and uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back an attorney called this time it's like why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well you don't have any listen missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nSaid no we don't have any less\nSo years ago somebody said well maybe you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my authors status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together a list I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system\nAnd I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because we still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards and every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer there can screen the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you know but he believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nNo it's it's pretty clear they don't want\nTo cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and um and I were going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people\nYou're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read a report start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue they can't I Can't find descent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the farm team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe dissent isn't there I've had reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out it's like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times the time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM many of the victims\nThree four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the first thing disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world should Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but ... much more of a role as I explained and many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation you're walking down the trail with your friends or your loved one\nAnd they walk ahead of you you fall behind them at that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens it's\nAlmost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment now function and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that\nInterested in specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical crushed during that I figured out after I started putting Ken's in a U.S map when I started track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in a lab and other countries of the world where\nThese this exact same sort of thing happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and its men women as four to one ratio correct I any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors in out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I\nGuess\nWe're talking with David Blaine is about his latest work missing war one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they will raise the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles they ended the break we'll be right now\nAll right um talk for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data um for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the report that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports that name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most time times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era that girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspect there's no crime why can't I see\nIs there is no suspects there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you wanna fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you send me\nThat these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disposed to the public upon the crust\nColorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you've got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's the superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that uh you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specific to your the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further uh you'd you'd never heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the old story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird do explain\nKnow makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or\nThey don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed in communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and\nI don't understand it I Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office helped on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases ah you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a called ... per ... V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spade a lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean port of Suzanne\nRound trip hike of about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top so\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scramble to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him he reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went out and look for her\nWhile the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her up the ... summit and communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at them out and about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for eventually called the snow homeless county sheriff\nAnd the search was on\nSo that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of experts are pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual they add cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because\nYou're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance with his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just staying on site in search in day and night although actually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and that kind of gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before that a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they said that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do not Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do you\nDon't go to the local news media and you'll understand this church is the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them\nBut they national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS the national heroes you want to get one

Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early well\nThey exit the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and deputy came out random registration on the rent Iraq in the vehicle came back registered to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second and parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nThey called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise] [noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland\nAnd the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and it seemed to some assistance from the national guard Kenyans and search teams\nSearchers faced rain and wet conditions for many other days but again the searched and start for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything endeavor dogs were later put into that area never picked up ... percent\nThey ah they had a psychic approach them and the second went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little TPP structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and it's like you said you needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there\nAnd they are hoping they said that they are now any communications with the sheriff and yours none never with the forest service Stevens never been found\n... search was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least less left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I say this that every conference and I said on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a personal located or be can cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there's no monthly service feet and get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched\nBut someone needs help immediately they'll\nFind you within eight feet the dispatch search and rescue I carry one every time I go out and I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nWell whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but I you know search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nI don't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack away from I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen or I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd I think that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic they got involved in this case have you ever employed disturbances of psychic or have you ever invest the end of the cage were psychic was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\n[noise] tell your story is um there's remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently he will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people and ask them if you had ever found anybody and he gave me the name of this person\nAnd I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person help you in finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me\nAnd and other remote viewing cases there was one guy at a conference with the ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote fewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics owners row at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduced myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help wanted help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them the next week\nWhen I got back and I never got a response from one of them [laughter]\nWe're talking with ... about his newest book missing for one more on land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week here's a part of this vast\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend he was a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the ... early they laugh early on that Monday morning Henry ... states that he dropped him off at\nA location and critically at the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry\nPhone up here's Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left a lengthy voicemail strange sound screening paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human found or their animal found or what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes uh some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's only now unlike anything you've ever heard of before [noise]\nNow unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nYou're going to be only one [laughter]\nVery little actual talking what are you concerned that disturbing middle of the night call came from Henry McCain cell phone it with labor date September Seventeen to twenty eight in the morning McCain worried why her demented\nHis cell phone ...\nMinutes at a meeting he certainly is a nonprofit agency enacted Joe between but police in

either Henry or another person than I think they try to picture where he\nWent at night and I\nWent back in ... and\n... sound like that\nNow is it dark contract to other articulate recordings of McCain speaking at an event state auditor\n[noise]\nDimension is one of the evidence now police are reviewing the police chief tell me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and ... did she says the investigation to get here on to\nSay [noise]\nRight see part which borders you write known un friendly all areas where Medicaid was reporting team orange cell phones ... search they came up and\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of ... have you ever seen any of that analysis reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion was that was\nNever it climbed up so tight but one thing I I've written about and pass books is that the FBI follows these cases\nThere's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in the ... it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow last tower that they can that phone was Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nAnd many other cases I've written about in the past and missing from one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy man that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he was going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canine helicopter's ground teams everything\nOn November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a kayaker was on rush wake\nOne mile south east of the last time they cannot fall on the cell body in the water and they recovered it there was no violence at all to the body according to the corner\nThe termination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nThat one of the things that I presented and sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men\nWas that many times the families did not accept the determination quite a corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy several\nTimes when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim\nAnd they were an level so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it they pass out they realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never have any of their friends relatives et cetera seem the point where they disappeared [noise] sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B teenage couldn't truck point to point a lot of times it happened in the winter and there was no marks from the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they leave but you say\nAnd to you that you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a bank of snow you would die from hypothermia\nYou wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf they placed you on the water you would die by drowning knock from GHB and you see G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by coroners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat they're recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony\nAnd then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody on there that says stop it that's a that's a that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend has its says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off he's found days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing in his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons unknown by things unknown almost like no one gigantic burden swooping down and snatching them up\nUm you know so many raises\nCalling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this or heard John this YouTube say this this is I don't say that and I want people to

to a related story to a Mr polite is uh\nAbout a missing people are in the Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that uh over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body parts and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and ah\n[noise] and since the during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a miss a missing son and uh he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh [noise] you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement to close the case and ah and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr a ... is a being aware of this a phenomenon of a\nOf the feet a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers and and over there\nYeah I'm I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you you know if you wanted to try to contact him we have a we have links on the coast to coast website his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a Dave I I Know he knows about the ... the story because it was a widely publicized but your son\nI'm One of the circumstances where did that happen and when\nOkay uh if it happened in Bellingham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened uh it and this happened two years ago October\nUh he uh he had left\nHome and uh we believe that maybe there may have been\nSome friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently it ran out a gash in a ... didn't have any money to get gas so he took off walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back and uh that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out and uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with uh with uh the law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones ah I'm In their cupboard a carry over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed\nUp period and ah we were just show a broken over that uh and uh and since then\nUh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talked to a few times to some of the people that actually investigated on it and they just basically told me that uh that they were\nA a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the the wife uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically\nOnly given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything at all after that so well for that reason why yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David I'm is brightest and she went to see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website or that okay\nI I Would just you try that website that okay good that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes away and the fact that you just don't know it was just a brutal\n... thank you Roger thanks for calling in will try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs for two national parks a glacier in the valley in Alaska and one thing I Would say a specially looking at an alley the emphasis structure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus\nNo real hiking trail and if you go off the uh those roads like the footing would be that hiking so\nI I I Would say it and I would call late to flip glacier ah they really on the play chess how treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials that are like twenty mile trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can go wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and cutting for feed\nA that I don't know anything could happen what the wild animals the one thing now I don't think\nUh what's happening as some sort of Charles ... groups that are looking to just five isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think\nThat people go to those parks for like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker fell I I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening\nUh but uh I I think what David Sanger without that national parks have very little supervision people are\nAre you know there are just off on their own towards the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was at a one more thing on that is my ... theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I for one is a ... looked like something from Jurassic Park\nSo I Do wonder if that's or a moat right there is some sort of ... historic bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know they're criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are ... ... wrote weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who vanished I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but uh I appreciate that thought oh we're going to take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines uh we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um\nBut I can understand how the elements in a sort of close in on you a little bit and it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the um we're going to go to the break the shell and taste taking them to the break and we'll be right back\nHere and there was like oh I Know you're just like a greyhound walking on my way you're on a couple of weeks later or out of there\nOn a couple of weeks later because we're running out of their bag and it never was ever I think it was every every game you know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the ac I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least in the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing but no I hadn't heard this story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at room rock lake thanks for sharing that no appreciated we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um this evening a you guys were talking about David Paterson you were talking about the skin Walker ranch right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that it and I pointed out the radio because I've read all the books I've read all the full on what books I've read the skin Walker ranch book\nAnd I've been following this thing for some time for several years\nA ... was ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of disappearances\nAre a lot of this uh parents has happened on or near rich line and I just couldn't walk ranch that's on a ridge like\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taken no one ever see something taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows whenever somebody is on the property or on around it's just to me I I'm just saying to me uh in my opinion I think that you know the the skin walk ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the the phenomenon surrounding the Fort one one\n[noise] [noise] well I you know I think there are some similarities and that then it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do with themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is their skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have other here but not all\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of the um gouge marks on them other than ... things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do and you read a dachshund stories and things like that\nBut that that doesn't fit but as far as rich lines go on and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate a no one ever sees sees it uh that that to me is uh some good strong Marsha\nThanks thanks for sharing your impressions when there's a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas a he has his id he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome Georgia I have a ticket for taking my call I lead you might\nBe my experience or this year at a park in San Antonio which they added another channel ... miles up bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd um this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time almost nearly me and my wife were using a vice going down to chart a course that was a little ahead of her and uh we got through this one area where it got kind of dark even do it with their life but it was so what is that it was\nThe sun sunlight shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of the dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was that going on the stump they look more like a bird\nOut but uh you know you never know I mean they kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall Dixie\nAnd just the air and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she those and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it back to a bit flying away but the wingspan was sold large it was an them\nIt was like a regular bird you know I mean we have ducks and I'm ... and all kinds of stuff and I am a park nearby but\n... and all kinds of stuff and not spend a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parts where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is and so I just wanted to share my story because I Know we didn't report it to know cops or or any park rangers they said well why don't we didn't have no evidence is too it's kinda hard to believe that there could be that big and we were just two\nPeople are just riding bikes than a a [noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said the thing is seven feet tall that have just like a regular birds they threw a do you remember what coloring on Mars all you\nSaw was kind of like\nA maybe ... some things that his eyes colleague long just like it here to see a beer in the dark flow war or something like that you knew staring at you but you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really tell exact details especially when there wasn't that this that and I I mean first thing you know I Know this was a sense that something was staring at me and that's why that's so it made me look\nAnd what not to my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so I so second\nShe turned around and just try and fly away so I couldn't really saw the ad like hands arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it

they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the airing screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't

just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but then so be it neither now so she\nShe she know express something that I began you you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here which is I'm In title to this I did the hard\nWork and school and college and I deserve this was the end of that is not the case no one is titled to go on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college at his alleged to do and no one who performed the way who did it on Thursday deserves to be given an judge\nYour reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race I'm like I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you\nYou're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats your high school\nI I don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade I mean why is this high school the\nLimit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know\nUseful indiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying\nWell we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and he got\nBelligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament for the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive and responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's
