escapist were then maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had to write for a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an ice skate from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really liked that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which\nI think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic book could've unfolded into actual movies for the national seems\nA where someone could take a twilight zone episode and kind of unfold and then to an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that the twilight zone and that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that a scape his tone to it or you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually\nThree miles from that bait\nAnd a little town called ... up the road about Mao and a half or two miles with little post office where are you ... where I used to have a ... and that's where rod you could spend that yeah

both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had panel discussions and radio perform a scripture radio scripts performed um so I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to get a

also make I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw [noise]\nYou know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what ... what was the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um ditch hiker is one that I I think it was definitely one of the one of the first ones I ever saw [laughter]\nWhatever only on my way right\nYea going my way and he's been have chasing a you know chasing a driver chasing evidence just showing up on the road constantly uh on the on a road trip um that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we you'd look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know ... you know Raj brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually a consultant Roger consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they didn't ever ever ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother ah for advice on those so he actually got a technical consultant credit on on that particular episode\nNext stop we go to Brad Bird in the angels camp California Hi Brett heard\nHey Nick was I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling\nA tail it involved what they call the ... the lead guy that was and a half so um\nThat started with a guy at a bar looking kind of just wandering or whatever and and uh probably crying

D. V. copies of this the Gary type and pass them around from city to city to city hall right and\nThis book ... a has a picture of both Craig's\n[noise] um [noise] Ambrose type and the paper copies that they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city bench surely up and not watched and a woman says those are my three such children\nWow those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne\nScoping your attic and scrounge around science command takes this is right after he gave me this book go up my addict I live in an Eighteen forty house has few spook so that so I\nGo up and is Sadek and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived and there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when it was purchased\nOne of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs\nOf Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's three kids staring right at us we\nDropped the book and shrink [laughter] I mean that's\nWhat kinda coincidence is that right that's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\n[noise] well you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques is they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness\nBut there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with a weed cheap boards and stuff and I\n... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely true when

what's your take on this bizarre story\nHazing when it comes to the murder of a dramatic how shall we all may not be as it\nSeems far from it we're told that on the order of a high level Saudi intelligence officer Fifteen Saudi hitman boarded a plane and Saudi Arabia flew to Istanbul, Turkey and lay didn't wait at the Saudi embassy the ambush ... when he came in to do the paperwork necessary to Maria's living girlfriend who as you said it's Turkish\nShowy as a journalist who was once close to get this the New York or Saudi Arabia crown prince Mohammed bin ... and who went to high school with Osama bin Laden show\nHe was so corrupted by the Saudi royal family but he was allowed to have the two major Saturday newspapers all what town in New York Times ... made a mistake\nIn two thousand and sixteen just after Trump was elected president he criticized Donald Trump he said that Trump's attempt to closer relations with Russia would also bring Trump closer to Saudi Arabia's arch enemy Iran a country that the Russian ally\nTrump and his son in law Jared Kushner were tight with the Saudi royals could show these criticisms just leave the crown prince though in Saudi Arabia show he was banned from print media totally couldn't print a word\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again a he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great great shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends ... I wrote a book about the twilight zone in subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if you did most of them in the pool\nIn the pool but he's certainly dictated most description and us I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod sterling who he was he was a vet\nIts own even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he\nHe wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them in did you get that from his combat oh he's from his ass yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several\nTimes a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually sat in lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally\nRevisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television more than he\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up\nAnd television needed writers I it was it was it was this fast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just\nDevoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff out and stuff out until finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk this got Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the way to hit a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before you got in the twilight zone use a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven\nUh toilets on started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and\nHe just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that Serling ran into is that heat believe that it's a writer's job to do those things it's a ... job to address the issues of his time and every time he tried to address any\nIssue with any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself\nThat they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction horror you know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he's always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a tell them search that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of\nA the artists job the art if it's going to be art it has to do what he would say it has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nDo you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his ...\nThink about something what do you think some of the issues that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning and if that's the root of all of them\nSo he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own fault when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe joined us some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was wrecking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone it's the only the only one it made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it's lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite\nFrankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from him get from\nPoint a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script icing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter in a Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my ... my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got\nAnd that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nBut what rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes of five seed that's pretty prolific that is that's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five season periods just if you know and and\nAt the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it maybe he got that in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did him in you said that brought the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts and some of the things she did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nHa ha so if you take those that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides twilight zone a night gallery\nStay with us that we are going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with a buddy above the twilight zone and Nick ... with us his book is called rod Serling his life's work in an imagination\nThe first and only shades installed without any screws or tools\nYou heard me right customs shades butter insult without any tools worked it'd be easier and with my personal fitter free guarantee I guarantee you're blind fit role remake the free of charge you only pay shipping\nNow there's no reason to ever pay a high price professional whereby poorly fitting ready made blinds visit to dot com today and save a bundle\nTests because listeners take up to fifty percent off any order just use the code coast that check out that's Blinder dot com blinds T.

C. with us\n\n\nHey and won't come back to the coast to coast George nowhere with you with Nick ... with us a rod Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there\nA hundred and fifty six hundred wow and I know three of them for example it's a good life in praise of long distance call were with a guy who ... who was a kid the here and everybody into the cornfields [laughter] you know they show are you in as a matter of fact I have a little surprise for you Nicholas\nReally movies with a Billy hey George how are you man on the line Nick there you go\nHey bill good to talk to you it's good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay you can you give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you now okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're very badly [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd we knew you were in those episodes and they were being done was runs surely in around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nThe twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer ... account and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know but it gets a little\nUptight yeah though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around him did he talk with you yeah yeah sure we went out for Marguerite is every night and you know\nThat's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six uh six seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first lead roles I it was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon the course Leishman played my mom and a\nAnd the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pets\nI was busy guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days really what's new\nWell a Angela car right now I've just released aren't novel a fantasy novel I think we talk to you about it when we were first writing any time and go charge on purpose it's called the devil secrets and chicken and all the adversary his weapons\nWhile you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm married he was thrown ancient aliens and you know I'm playing the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music to\nYou than us don't you believe thinks that's it you got it by George Bailey movie you're not a treat neck\nAnd I was thinking George so that was great\nHe was a I did run certainly for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] my yeah my calling from the from\nThe other side what inspired you to read the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know ... by the show and and so that started everything and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm done this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done for the first thing I wanted to do is I Want to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so and then once I did that\nIt's higher career that was produced in any form whatsoever so and then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been haven't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the the themes certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know delved into him et cetera\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes um [noise]\nThe probably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of\nThe story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance\nWhile I was able to find the ... the actual\nFirst draft of the script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these you know if the fear and says came into play and there have been several studies\nOf this particular show in the evolution that it's so from some you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you and now it's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod surely\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he he mark Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pasture but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination\nHe and William fruit that one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we've got to get something quick\nThat we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and getting lung fruits had listened that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer than that\nDown and like I guess I don't know this message brought to you by the American Institute of certify company comes and the ad council\nWe only recycle half the aluminum we use the rest ends up in landfills or his litter can we change that make bad puns and recycle through the fifty cans campaign would do something dot org you can win a five thousand dollars scholarship just text can get three eighty three eighty three\nMatt how are you getting these tax question mark\nAre you what are you doing now and ... you are making me man you better take me back\nA waiting outside your house we rent me a ... like an angry robot lady you're making ... ... planet now about not cool on dot com\nNot not cool dot com rocky your body I Can't tell\nFirst Saudi Arabia now turkey\nFirst Saudi Arabia\nNow turkey I'm Dave Anthony Fox News secretary of state Pompeo has now moved on on the mission to find out what happened to that journalists presumed murdered he says in his talks with the Saudi leaders\nI stress the importance of them\nConducting complete investigation sisters\nThey're good at Fox is Simon ... from London day the secretary of state meeting with Cherokees presidents as well as the foreign minister who described the\nTalks as beneficial and fruits felt the minister also sang Turkish police how she went to the rest of the so the ... ... ... ... today the consul general they ... as a pro government newspaper techie\nPublishes the tails of an alleged audio recording cleaning ... shut your mouth ... keeping taught should killed\nAnd ... men but inside the Saudi ...

I wrote a book about the twilight zone and the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in

the pool but he certainly dictated most description\nAnd us I I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but showing with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling\nGo back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nSure was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation\nSo he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part I'm so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's got 'em for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality\nTo them in did you get that from his combat ... is just young and he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the toilets on so [noise]\nUm it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of\nTwilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually setting lady um during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television was any\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up and television needed writers or was\nIt was it was this fast you know I always say vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff out and stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no you know the what he had a a treat with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before you got in the twilight zone he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the toilet so he had written you know you won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started an fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out\nAnd he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama\nSensibility into the twilight zone and gave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and

do those things that the writers job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and thankfully for ... for a ride he was\nSuccessful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he created the twilight zone because he's always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message that in it\nOh absolutely if it was a tell them that just had a cool twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of the art is job the art if it's going to be art it has to what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... were then he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career of the big the biggest issue was prejudice\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was it he believed it all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning and that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this\nUm this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own fault when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the toilets on before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about sixty years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction is all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone it entered the consciousness\nJust as a term you know people know that\nThe twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something strange something is you know not quite right and it lasted all this time because of of routes messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so\nWell produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from him get from\nPoint a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter in a bread very just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nBy what rod didn't write all the script she oversaw things but he knew right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no no listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote in Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episodes over five seats that's pretty prolific\nThat is that's ridiculous I mean nobody right from Ninety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced you never slept you just never slept from Nineteen fifty to Seventy five that was it [laughter]\nHe smoked 'til I sold it and he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it and maybe he got back in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah I absolutely had heart issues and that's what's finally did him in you said that brought the ... do well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows that's crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night\nGallery stories ha ha so if you know they do is that's a hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us that we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk more next hour we'll take phone calls with him about a about the twilight zone Nick ... with us his book is called rod Serling his

twilight zone episodes were\nThere a hundred and fifty six hundred and ... and I know three of them for example it's a good life in praise of pit long distance call with that guy really moved me who was a kid that scared everybody into the cornfield\nShe'd done here and everybody into the cornfields [laughter] you know they sure yeah as a matter of fact I'm a little surprise for you Nicholas nearly movies with Billy hey George how are you man on the line Nick there you go\nHey bill good to talk to you it's good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay you you give us the band bad man\nOh I'm working for you now okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man your iPad [laughter] your voice has not changed all that much really really still waiting for puberty to strike what can I say\nIf you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the ... zone\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was run surely around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when he did his you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast\nOn the twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer ... account and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to him about what was coming up in the next episode her so usually when an executive producer or creator comes on and it was sad but it gets a little uptight though that you know or when Alan's here [laughter]\nOr whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around him\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd that's right and how old were you you were a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat's how did they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um\nWell actually there was one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of uh Loretta Young show that was directed by James Sheldon the course Leishman played my mom and a and the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it is a good life\nSo having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pets\nI won't be the guy and you were you were in now where do you do in these days really what's new\nWell a angel a car right now I've just released aren't novel a fantasy novel I think we talked about it when we were first writing\nIn time and go charge on purpose it's\nCalled the devil ... and all the adversary his weapons\nWhile you set yourself with some uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm ready to throw in ancient aliens and you know I'm play on the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music too\nYou know the Billy thinks that's it you got it by George Miller gloomy on St Nick\n... I was thinking George so that was great\nYou know as I get run surely for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] my yeah my calling from the from the other side\nWhat inspired you to read the book about certainly\nWell [noise] I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know ... by the show and and so that started everything and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he'd written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm done this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced TV or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ... had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done for the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so\nAnd then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that you know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been that haven't been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give them that reader an idea of what these shows were about\nSo you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the\nScott but it's also part biography in this part you know critical analysis of the themes certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know delved into in ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was remotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous in that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday\nIt was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until it was a fourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman and this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of\nThe story and Everytime he tried to he you know he met resistance\nWell I was able to find the actual first\nDraft of the script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these you know if the fear and says came into play and there have been several studies\nOf this particular show in the evolution that it's ... from some you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily\nFound the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you and now it's not\nAll that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNoon on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod surely\nIt uh it devastated them he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he\nHe mark Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of his Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen\nSo it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while and strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination\nHe and William fruit that one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and asked to produce a film to introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world\nWhile it was a document they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we got to get something quick\nThat we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the the assassination when he was you know depressed for sure flew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that he finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need to spend five days [laughter] and and and William fruits headless and that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they

the set a it was yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead I\nMake a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be a vaccine like it was very escapist well then maybe someone stay back in the sexes I'm just speculating if you had a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really liked that my second question would be about\nThe mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic book could've unfolded into actual movies for the national scene\nA where someone could take a twilight zone episode and kind of unfold and then to an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that the twilight zone I mean that's I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that a scape is tone to it or you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually\nEscape is tone to it um you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery ah in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else that they go into the gallery and escape\nThrough that so he never really said that about the ... some but I think the similar a point can be made about the twilight zone as well [noise]\nUh and it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film although there's been there have been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone and ... you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well be toilets on movies that aren't pulled the twilight zone\nWas it Jack London on one of the twilight zones\nHe's starting for twilight zone yeah actually they actually started one with the movie um in praise of tough that's right yeah yeah and he was\nTerrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone and and three of the episodes that he was on\n... trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passage for trumpet rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um jak caught me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote or called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep\nFilming [laughter] together any way we can make\nThis into a two part episode he wants to expand the effort to an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know this and we just can't be done at the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm going to film whatever he does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason governance or\nWell where are you folks wherever that President they say why like those radios theater and they take some of the old episodes ran for radio and they also incorporate residents date things and have a\nCurrent topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when it had to do with a nano robots eating um oil spill in the problem with that could present and I just thought it said and I think with the sterling they\nCool did you know about that Nick\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of a of a current will not\nDidn't run ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to or where it's a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network and he wrote you know for radio or in college\nAnd so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four\nSo basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called that happens to you and it was a series of Thirteen um original radio scripts\nWhere did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most and Pacific palisades for most of his a professional career and then he always went back to uh Africa in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was the belonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\n... years old was any or something\nLike that was fifty yeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was and it was in New York time\nUh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explains you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a ... you know artery from this here in play here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say I need a you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so\nNew that that explains the surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought it was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another attack on the table\nAnd that was pretty much\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHi towards a I got a little trivia but a right uh uh I Lived in central New York from Seventy Seventy five and I worked on a military\nBase called Seneca army ... load okay and I\nSay a big a big arts and all that has nuclear weapons\nAre quite a few actually been on a nerd a anyway rods home woods about two or three miles from that day\nAnd a a little town called ... up the road about Mao and a half or two miles with little courage stuff where are you ... where I used to have a purge brokered bark\nWhere are you ... where I used to have a ... and that's where rod you could spend that yeah when he he had a a swimming pool built\nOn his property there a couple of miles away right next to be a base ah it's actually an arsenal and uh I used to talk to the uh\n[noise] a postmaster sort of like a one room a purge profits\nAnd I said I I heard ... said yeah it comes to an once in a while and I always wish I had met him but I never did but I I think that's where he is there a sense it's taped a crew of Los Angeles who uh the uh contract encouraged a\nTV program and uh\nYou know he's very here already yeah as I say you lived right on Lake ... uh and and if the guy and that's not not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate in Ithaca and some of the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting Steve what else you know about it\nWhat's that what else do you know about it and that's cool well uh\nWhen his career started the sink a little bit uh he went back to that area and he taught at a I Believe it's Cornell University down there and uh he uh he buried not far from it it's a where it's somewhat in that\nLittle cemetery called the inner lake and right on the lake and much loved that area and that whites are when they first got married they had their honeymoon\nThere a\nOn a lake or a her parents are her relatives parents probably\nOn their property and he bought it eventually and they lived there and they all went back there on a summer to uh write and relax and uh but uh a funny thing is you do a little radio a\nPromotion for ah people hey no an area like a sheet or whatever my feet up more store\nI may not which kinda cute you hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now let's just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... and every ... which really nice guy\nThat's the way to do it in a negative sounds of your eye he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college or or local businesses that have you as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever sent he ever get a letter he ever wrote he kept and they still exist them you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally you know personal letters written the shined and everything [noise] um he took that time to do that and it's really amazing that that you can't really find\nSomebody saying a bad word about Russia\nYou know you really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break them we're gonna come back with final phone calls

we've watched rare films and you know had Powell discussions and radio perform a scripture radio scripts performed um so I've had you know done a lot of a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his home town a and that should come come across through several twilight zone episodes and so\nWe're trying to get statute both form they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton so these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I would've loved to have them on the show Nicholas\nUh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died

gotta I've I've got to give credit to our our executive producer Lisa lion and Dan highs are our producers for putting that together\nYes and also make I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw\nYou know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what twilight zone episode was the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I I think was definitely one of the ... one of the first ones I ever saw\nBut for them ... waiver right\nYeah going my way and these have been chasing a you know chasing a driver chasing up and it's just showing up on the road constantly uh on the on a road trip um that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we you'd look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs and it just kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know ... you know robs brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually a consultant Rob consulted with him about that particular episode another episode they did that if it ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother ah for advice on those so he actually got a technical consulting credit on on that particular episode\nNext job we go to Brad Bird in the angels camp California Hi Brett heard\nHey Nick was I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling\nA tail it involved what they call that ... that was and a half so um\nIt started with a guy at a bar looking kind of just wandering or whatever and and uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up\nAnd gave him a a match

is\nYou cannot drink to get\nMoney not drink on ... the message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very very uncomfortable and give you a really bad stomach reaction and so what it was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it said on alcohol it was doorman unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up and then if it would just you\nKnow crave the alcohol and make you really really sick because it was growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I could tell you that for sure but it does sound that that part about it created feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not necessarily\nThat they were so many classic shows no they all these different messages remember the one where the camera

is absolutely true when when you do you run a gene and you've been to some of these older pleases and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um\n... the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or I died and the story was that he killed themself and uh I go through there with my buddy\nAnother buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal is this for a for some lawyers and\nAnd and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was LSD person\nIn the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission ... period nothing had been cleaned\nOr ... years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things out of them um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier\nSo I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my buddy won't go up and the addict I Know what's wrong with you\nBecause why there's something wrong there\nWhat are you talking about it because I\nSaw something up there I saw goes up there I said come on that we're working here right it's not time for this right like we got a lot to do he would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing my photography up there and went downstairs took some more

photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or like balloons every single photograph in that house had these these weird or sent him\nNone of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spilt water on the lens and I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nNo problem just up and that's strange addict that's where my buddy says that's what I saw\nVery strange do you find that the older the object more possible that it could be haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that ah

months later I came home in a wheelchair and double vision I had to learn to walk again to speak\nGetting people are very outraged about that a that this was going to continue and get worse and indeed we had a thirty eight percent jump in family units crossing the border and the month of August from the month before a so this is no surprise I some deal\nNo absolutely not a lord actually outsource but it took this long for a cure it like this to assemble the fact is that you know we see these courts no cubs Italy a corporate ... the president's effort to\nUh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to the plume individual that your purpose would come to the United states is live and work in the United states and you get released you've got all that you want it let's say it's the center for those individuals her to the states we need to cut up as big as the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up\nNeed to cut off those magnets the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise] you know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what are they are a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to have these families that their cases could hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out and took the bag cases could eat that night and those folks can be returned United States\nThey could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states that they can you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum a lot of well they should be applying for asylum let's hope but they're not in addition they are the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where unaccompanied alien a minors has to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're ... and it doesn't matter how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts and been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter I said it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels city okay you want to put babies in cage and he went about maybe how many times did we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available Congress can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip to these people take to the United states is so horrendous\nRapes robberies murders under the Obama administration when they had similar ah programs we saw NPR run articles about as we saw a National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore always your little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent\nMake sure that her mother doesn't have any cops ban their child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parents and subject their child but this horrendous drone states is beyond ...\nWell when you when you see these\nThousand people now it's just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this like there's no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars a cost to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect the administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though\nAre you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody that they are given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor this is another incentive again went back to verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states we need mandatory either verify that the keys the kingdom but\nUntil we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so those are the cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under five orders for local they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states\nEverything that they had coming than they've had but they remain in the United states will continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading in\nIce chips lacks the resources to go out and find ones and twos these are people plus you you put on top of that the ... century laws places like California and localities where you know people under five orders removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that the runner up of order removal\nAnd yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries but everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work what any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night\nArt and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yeah so all he said was luck I Want to work in the United states and there are no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the cook coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview you tell the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be the same and I fear for fame for my family that I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why\nSessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a\nMind security bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's been a drop about Seventy five to ... percent of all people who claim credible fear than to have credible fear even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before the problem is that if\nPeople allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that at the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that authority back to er at the Justice Department needs that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations\nWhether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also a sense it's here's someone else made the point when someone claimed domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm\nHorrible thing but think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic me into my train of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nA local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government investigate it whether or not that claim took place in the whole country nothing that's contained asylum application and be disclosed\nTo anyone outside of that asylum recede we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the TV puree the trafficking victims protection that we have actually a handover of the company alien minors to ha chess and agents a department of the United states government really doesn't", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "17"}
