colonel Robert McGinnis just a moment the author of alliance of evil and we will open up the phone call\nAnd it's for two hours of creepy piece of footage from a family in Ireland seems to show some kind of figure momentarily appear on a baby monitor in the video a couple are setting up the device that they can keep an eye on their baby has the husband remotely adjusts the camera so it shows his wife's face he\nHas stunned to see what appears to be someone's head poke out of a doorway behind his wife\nAfter unleashing a be wielded cry demand runs into the room to track down the oddity but finds that there is no one there except for his wife\nAnd the baby on the last insists that he saw something in some online viewers agree suggesting the anomaly with some kind of anti or perhaps even a ghost\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having a nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one once\nAlternately well the it's just too rich so the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our patriots and other fat to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation uh everyone is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nOr so NATO no I I don't think that they should be of member of NATO you know NATO such a complex\nThing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour uh because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and\nMilitary exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging I'm so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing turkey into our secrets into our cyst\nBut certainly allowing turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up to the house of Saud mud and given that so much of the narrative of the show gave me a murder has come from the Turks and also cutter\nOr another sort of sworn enemy in Saudi Arabia hospitable do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet Joe political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night uh I suppose some details will eventually come out with the clandestine type of operations from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if the show was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten million it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world or otherwise you end up with no\nOne that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who tease others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just a North Korean some uranium but others\nI think are a air to one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how ... how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nI I Do believe that a lot and we will talk to his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that um Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty was\nAh was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes uh [noise] you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world's leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy and but he does have the president's year and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a and of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel uh we we have no question I think after that\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs [noise]\nAh we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become that of a secular\nNon align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the\nYou know the military and their diplomacy or\nYou know to promote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the ... when I I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with a thought that they are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests\nAnd perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue um but it it if you're not involved and you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nNow we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and\nThey have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going\nBut we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration is earmarked to proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year a ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to ... hours and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which it just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and train to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft these antiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a furiously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia specially combined a fair forming a new alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain the investment in long term capabilities\nSustain the investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas Skinny Me good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast thing yeah\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nGreat questions dean is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today\nA there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter at the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm\nI'm I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps the ... they would let it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground of cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that we hear about every day this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of\nLos Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place one\nCard line Don his intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy ... of a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that\nThat's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against you know our key allies and against our interest\nIn those five it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth and will not touch the ground and it will destroy the ram that has the two horns and said that the ladder horn is the bigger ... that comes up last them\nThe first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last time that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touching around which means it's going to be a naval or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with that we're actually\nUh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with a we're actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this was a deal application prophecy also uh I never Alexander the great a Congress but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as you know explain to you know this prophecy so ah and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her\nOr has the wing hoping eagle\nAnd those wings will be plugged in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecies and\nThere are a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob Let's say you know\nI I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIt's used elsewhere even in revelation or the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from\nA uses cheeses and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces\nAre terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card lining cheese in Springfield, Massachusetts Susan good morning welcome to cause\nA problem where I live now oh tearing at radio show

him up on a warm day\nAt time you're fading out on me hear your your phone is fading out on he said something about ending the draft yeah we'll\nDress shouldn't be ended the draft should be reinstated as what I'm really saying that's one of them but I mean here's the problem where do you think oh about ... war and I don't\nBlame Russia it seems to me I'm American never been out of the country I was raised in Indiana and\nYou know in the middle of this country\nWhy should I feel this way and it was shot in the head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that\nI was Catholic of course I was that was a direct assault on or you know a on me and ... and all\nThe uh the nine eleven and ...\nYou know Richard what's happening\nHere said you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call [noise] well\nBefore Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy\nUm\nBut has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war\nOr after the first World War and began to\nEngage in multilateral\nTrade organizations and ah he did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warned against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a\n... this these sorts of\nUm\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable\nWhen you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign lands that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's\nDirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption and I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have\nStrong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism\nIt hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we like it but the United states yes\nThey they have been involved if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nJust doesn't isn't for ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has they do the same thing but they don't\nReflect upon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption\nAt least in the United states that exists\nWe reflect we're right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call a\nDoug is Easter the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our food being I'm well thank you\nGlad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I tried to get some time ago a there was a yes vote them so to so and ah they were talking about our climate change\nIn such a yourself and ah they were talking about climate change in a warming or\nThey're rising over the ocean now I'm not a a I'm not going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut ah they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which are that is the fact that it was a measure of all they can tell that but I was wondering I never heard anybody take into consideration water displacement\nEvery year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be giant a\nMulti ... a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're thinking I'm subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs were sinking old military about this is taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has a stop for some time and that's also taken a while about taking a water but it's adding land and ah I I think if a if anybody or you know of a and able to get that you've a hat on or hurt speak\nAbout this uh ever brought up the theory of water displaced\n[noise] uh no not that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of\nSea level rise that they're talking about isn't about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because\nYou know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow I'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been rising for a very long time I was wearing that kind of a\nTrans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age which still technically in an ice age we have ice at the north and south poles we always we haven't always had eyes to the north and south poles so\nOne eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three one eight hundred three eight seven nine nine zero three\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd a welcome back to coast to coast am

went through or damage of emotions as well so it was a even a rather low fat ... which are the two little girls that have on my wall there that can be from saint Jude long ago Gracie a rural area\nAnd they look at them that I just kind of broke down and\nI've never been a very Christian whole life I've never been able to handle the pain and the like the same home home today to me and\nEven though I ... I uh that's terrible problem when I said father as a picture of you life other than a little while and I suffered any more of this and not well why what all this ... this was going to go on for years\nAnd decades and decades hundreds of years and I say they can't go wrong\nOr right solve the problem with I looked at the pictures I couldn't believe it I have a milder today and like mild\nAnd the father with fame and the lack of a long\nIt's going to end it if and people just don't know that it's going to end very soon that they are they're going to be standing in place where the lessons are going to be standing ... sitting in their place\nAnd they're not going to know that we come upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that that's what caught me by my and uh I ... I'm barely I Believe\nLike at the from the Knight ... like a cease him that night [noise]\nTwenty five years and what was ever diagnosed with\nHIV I was one of those I was lucky that I've been a lot

and he just bought a loan me and he said they're not so much longer it's it's going to stop you he's telling me it's going to stop even before you even before I go\nAnd I think it ties into geopolitics what's going on today and I really do believe that maniacs and I I don't want to use the push share the deep state I call them\nUh I Would call them the maniacal money pours I can tell you that on line or the ... maniacal money horrors of the world there are going to bring that about because of that China and Russia to hold out\nAround of course the satellite state and they've said you

Bo a sick about six years ago and the football game he played the Steelers it's on YouTube you can take an ... halo\nYou'll see a giant halo floating over the football stadium that day a giant circle and the sky or people standing in the stands not show up staying in the stands commenting ... a halo for ... for Denver\nIt's the same game that all the three sixteen showed up from John three\nSixteen in the Bible people have yes we're in young\nPeople who painted drunk three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he won the beef the championship game against Oklahoma\nSo three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up he had John three sixteen and passing three sixteen yards thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six percent was the highest rating again go for the game\nBut I remember as the worst time of position thirty one minutes ... seconds the only interception was there down at sixteen and reckless burger through the interception ... that a white horse of the top of the stadium on the one in the ... mile high to the bronco\nDe Jesus when you see it as a ... thing in the stadium you see this guy in the clouds above it with a white horse will Jesus returns in a way of course with clouds with as a symbol red revelation\nOf Jesus return them away or some revelation the opening kickoffs in America opening kick off because it couldn't happen but I won't tell you that 'cause they'll take too long but anyway go ahead and I I Want I Want to get those facts out to you before\nMy phone cut off [laughter] it's ... it's remarkable and I I remember some of that not all of the details now he's not in the New York Mets a farm system now didn't that football and you can baseball now like any\nYeah you know it was really interesting and baseball to this really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like a you when you see the halo you know the real you know there's assembling Jesus is coming back you know there there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences were not coincidence that there are too many even the opening tick off at the cross bar in the back of the end zone which is located tenured steeped in the end zone Rickey said back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put us up on the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back there is no way that can happen it ever happening again anywhere near that but it happened to be getting it back and nobody knew as can be a blessed game until\nI Want to go to one in touch them or one plant over time the marriage Thomas cut the eighty or passing over time just one player was over in the overtime he's more on Christmas twelve twenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game the people that are three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago they're getting into baseball\nAnd yes he is an energy a set of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling ... in the in the stands\nI'm not sure whether they were having grass and he was getting ready to sign on ... or any of them had epilepsy feet or something\nOr ... when he I thought he may be resuscitated this this individual but he will he would've\nBeen over and pray for him and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and then he was choking he couldn't get his breath the ... are you going to pass out and maybe die I don't know but he he bent over to touch the guy's leg and then we did a prayer\nAnd um people were standing around lady couple of ladies standing around one of them are with the kid with winter on tweeter similar ... you know one of those tax that she thought she may be a witness the miracle or because the guy was a you know two paramedics or something there and they couldn't guy I'd be able to brief\nHe's an incredible individual and ... and I think I'll\nTell you one more thing really interesting he he when he played for the Mets he paid for the Mets minor league team when he played the river dogs who are to New York Yankee team back last year round the in the gym he played

B. ten ten so there you go [noise]\nUh coming up and hours one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired\nHe says America is locked in a new kind of do will Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist of authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing use nation economically and militarily\nAnd together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate fueled the rise of Vladimir ...\nAnd you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as\nCaptured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled nationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again\nAnd they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the ... guard a twenty time\nSpeed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House or that he has to have to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nIn Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of give the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want to end the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars a ... and how people need to appreciate how\nThis trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't\nUh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there it's what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that you know it can\nAnd the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different positions so\nAre there hopefully gonna meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump you know just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans did manage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nAnd it's a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other a component to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nUm the bed me is is driven by ... gene any way are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in we're the nation is as opposed to know what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is viewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russians constitutional court who even started to you know hint\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh\n... this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is a line just evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing who and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nIn fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the Russian prime ministers have been rushing Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their defense ministers just met you

perceive us a greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard it's Russia given\nTheir provocations but also a their military capability which they're not shy to exercise and around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and\nYou know has said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place I ... in nuclear submarine and and I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and\nJustifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nA someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that given that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you join up with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous or China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat the long term threat and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok\nTwenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators\nThat demonstrates that are these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and R panic\nTo refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with rising Chinese military and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five of course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over a stone yeah\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked or\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the like and we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what\nThey did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nGreat uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president is accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges or you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're

I started working back here in the early nineties and I ended up meeting my wife [noise]\nThe mighty ... here at ten ten after we married\nWe had our twin boys you were born [noise] they'll get this this month the tenth\nOctober ... at ten minutes after ten allotted tens and our family and of course mom and dad met and fell in love at C. F. R. B. ten ten so there you go [noise]\nUh coming up an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired\nHe says America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation\nEconomically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nAnd they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise]\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have\nAnd this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time\nSpeed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he doesn't want stability he does want to end the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nLet's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars are ... and how people need to appreciate how\nThis trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economics it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh achieve military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so I have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese me\nIf we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and it just like ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans to manage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nAnd it's a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of the the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nUm the bed me is is driven by ... in any way or are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint or the wife says what Hollywood is fueling all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he\nYou know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh ... this past march ... they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion a predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThere was a long history and in fact an alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red lights and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walking discovered some faith had already taken over title thank God I found out in

arrived\nWho do you perceive as the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocations but also a military capability or which they're not shy exercise around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operation\nSeizing around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations admiral rich and you know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two\nThe old Cold War was the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a ... a nuclear submarine and and I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and\nIn justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that and given that there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy a new issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nNow he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flood arena around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty eight team joined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise\nThese sorts of indicators\nThat demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three ...\nWar maybe World War three ...\nWell that that's why you know Trump has been over there you know find a shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so\nUh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps it's going to talk to his counterpart in crime on next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a\nYou know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of great\nA magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\n[laughter] talking about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused\nThe Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics it may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment to me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly the Pentagon you know be\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges our ... our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect\nThat the Chinese have\nAnd somehow you know put chips and these devices that can turn on and trance Mitt information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of

colonel Robert McGinnis and just a moment the author of alliance of\nEvil and we will open up the phone calls or open up the phone lines at the bottom of the hour\nQuestions and comments about the possibility that we are staring\nA new dual Cold War in the face and could lead to events that open the door for the biblical\nTimes we'll get to all that in the moment just remind also at the top of the next hour are open lines segment begins for two hours every piece of footage from a family in Ireland seems to show some kind of figure momentarily appear on a baby monitor\nIn the video a couple are setting up the device so they can keep an eye on their baby has the husband remotely adjusts the camera so it shows his wife's face he has done to see what appears to be someone's head poke out of a doorway behind his wife\nPlutonium and that puts you on a glide path to having nuclear capability and I think that's what I heard one once alternately\nWell the it's just too rich so the the the the turkey is buying um air defense system that would be at least under the umbrella of NATO offensively used to protect NATO from Russian missile yes\nAnd that yeah because we will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk practice secular rise that nation\nUh everyone is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nA so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour uh because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nDon't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them\nDon't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them um but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and\nMilitary exercises this was all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging I'm so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud mud\nAnd given that so much of the narrative of the show he a murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy in Saudi Arabia hospitable do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet Joe political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night uh I suppose some details will eventually come out with the clandestine type of operations from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if she could show that he was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship with a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically in that part of the world uh otherwise you end up with no\nOne that you can go to and work with and given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who tease others of course the Iranians\nYou know through proxies in that part of the world um [noise] I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of\nCourse as we see is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans in the uranium but others\nI think are a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president here who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how ... how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nI I Do believe that a vote and we'll talk onto his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty was\nAh was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I I think that will will get something I Know that you\nKnow they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west prompt\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I I\nI I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a ... of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe uranium syrup there's no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that will come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become more of a secular\nNon align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or\nYou know to promote their their sheer world view a and the autocratic rule view of of the ... of when I I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with\nAssad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh into Iran is going to continue um but it it if you're not involved and you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and\nThey have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going\nBut we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars in increased\nDefense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year uh is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to ... hours and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and and competitive for a while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to\nAll parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which it just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight to replace you know with your new aircraft these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships\nYou know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of something that Ronald Reagan said you know this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have\nFor you to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested\nA seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined are forming a new one alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh [noise]\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas Skinny Me good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast yeah\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nAre ships and it's and so forth and we\nCould find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter at the U.S\nSpy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it would they would let it landed there because of being hacked into you\nKnow well you know that's the sort of thing that we're very concerned about a cyber the battleground of cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two\nAnd not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon and that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of\nLos Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWhile it's hard line Don is in Kent, Ohio John good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy fab of a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a [noise] you know I I don't know that that's something that we would\nDo unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against our interest in those five it claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth and will not touch the ground and it'll to destroy the ram that has the two wars and said that the ladder horn is the bigger ... that comes up last than the first one\nThe the ladder horn is the bigger ... that comes up last them the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last time it comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touching around which means it's going to be a naval or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and um but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with the actual North Korea China and uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I never Alexander the great a conquered but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as you know explain to you know this prophecy so ah and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her or has the wing hoping eagle\nAnd those wings will be plugged in to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecies and\nThey're a a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question John Bob would say you know\nI I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIt's used elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from\nA uses Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces\nAre terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nAnd Susan is on the wild card lining cheese in

morning good evening welcome to coast\nLower certain uh thanks for taking my call and uh I just wanted to comment on you know I'm a your guest before and uh the last caller\nA and it it it you know I'm [noise] I'm not a young person in a [noise] and I've been in this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world at all I have never left the country [noise] and it seems extremely obvious to me\nThat uh something has happened to our government a home in the last fifty some years and it seems as though that a lot of people think that uh [noise]\nUh you know they preach uh patriotism they preach uh [noise] uh you know go defend our our country's three I'm In a jar military\nUh and our military really is a non military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that\nWe're not really in control of our government and any more it seems very obvious and uh it seems like a [noise]\nPeople that have a you know I Am a course of the younger people don't really you know remember America is it was you know in the fifties and sixties\nAnd uh they've lost touch with you know would they didn't lose touch it just it was it was never a savvy to them or what came before them and ah [noise]\nAh you know a lot of the country has opened up prisons around the world ... people have not yet that's not American to me it's not the way I was brought up is a miracle posted to torture people in prison for cross a\nDisease that is that the way it is [noise] uh and uh\nThe the government or\nStop the draft it only seven\nWhen your kids grown up on all get out of the\nDay at time you're fading out on me hear your your phone is debating emblem\nSaid something about ending the draft yeah the\nDraft shouldn't be ended the draft should be reinstated as what I'm really saying you know that's one problem but I mean here's the problem we're not looking for all of our government anymore and I don't\nBlame Russia it seems to me as an American never been to how the country have oh I was raised in Indiana and\nYou know in the middle of this country why should I feel this way Kennedy was shot in the head when I was maybe ten years old I remember that uh I was Catholic course I was that was a direct assault on or you know\nA on me and people around and uh the uh the nine eleven\n... you know a Richard what's his name you know you're\n... you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents\nUm I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy\nUm\nBut has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral Trade Organization\nIn multilateral\nTrade organizations and ah he did all those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warning against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a\n... this these sorts of\nUm\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable\nWhen you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign lands that those wars don't visited upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption and I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have\nStrong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it\nBut the United states yes they\nThey have been involved if you talk about a lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nJust doesn't isn't for ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has they do the same thing\nBut they don't reflect upon those\nSo it was dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption\nAt least in the United states that exists\nWe reflect we right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that\nTom thank you for your call or Doug is east of the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our youth or evening I'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I tried to get some time ago a there was a guest host them so to so and ah they were talking about our climate change in a warming and or\nThe ... the ocean now I'm not a a um you're not going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut ah they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which ah that is the fact that it was a measure of all they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I never heard\nAnybody take into consideration water displacement every year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be Jain a multi ... a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're thinking I'm subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs we're thinking old military now this is taking up space and\nUh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that has a stop for some time and that's also taken a while about taking the water but it's adding land and ah I I\nThink if ah if anybody or you know of or any of the guests that you've a hat on or hurt to speak about this uh ever brought up the theory of water to this place [noise]\n[noise] um no not that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of sea level rise that they're talking about is about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because\nYou know what happens when when ice cubes melt and a glass of water doesn't overflow I'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been ... rising for a very long time ah we're in a kind of a\nTrans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age which still technically in an ice age we have ice the north and south poles we always we haven't always had ice at the north and south poles so\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nA welcome back to the coast to coast am we're talking near death experiences and much more jarring are open lines segment let's go to Dan in great falls Washington a Dan welcome good morning\nRichard yeah there are many days right there are many and um\nI have a very important\n[noise] All right what\nAnd many days\nMany days my ailments are or many and um I had an epiphany they saw something very important\nAll right what did you see\nI saw a guy that for one thing I've been in bed so much\nAnd I went through a gambit of emotions I was listening to music eighties even a Romney middle south and I looked at the two pictures of the two little girls I have my wall there that can be from saint Jude too long ago Gracie and ruined\nAnd they looked at them and I just kind of broke down and I've never been there been Christian the whole life and I've never been able to handle the pain and it like to help you came home home today to me and even though I suffer I have such\nTerrible problems and I said father and there's a picture of Jesus' life other these little ones cannot suffered any more of this cannot go on ... I was just this this was going to go on for\nYears and decades decades hundreds of years and I said it can't go on and like solve the problem is I looked at the pictures I couldn't believe alive and smiled and daisy ad like smiled and the father was saying to me it's not going to go on\nIt's going to end you know if people just don't know that it's going to end very soon they are they're going to be standing in place where the lessons are going to be standing well laying are sitting in their place\nAnd uh they're not going to know that this comes upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that's that's what's coming up my and uh\nI'm actually I'm barely I Believe like a C spend the night ... like a seat in the night\nOr twenty five years and what was never diagnosed with HIV I was one of those I was lucky that I've been a lot like this long but when I went in\nThe doctors didn't say you have HIV they said I went and like not feeling when they said you aids\nAnd I said you know crazy but a bigger yeah that's what you have and I are calculated and I'm so grateful to the people of the United states of the world clearly people don't think I'm people like me are grateful I've taken like um\nI've got a number here are taken around the hundred and twenty thousand two hundred and twenty thousand\nOver twenty five years yeah they kept you alive\nAnd it's kept me alive and um all the the lemon didn't go the hurts bad and the lungs are bad but the ah I ended up getting prostate cancer but uh I looked at the girls today\nAnd I've had these these two girls are stuck to a thermostat I don't have any pictures 'cause I've always been like packed and ready to leave the service but um I stuck in them as thermostats along with the picture of Jesus it's top left\nRace the lower left growing up to write in Mary lower right\nAnd uh\nAnd he just brought a loan me and he said they're not going to suffer much longer it's it's going to stop he's he's telling me that's going to stop even before you go even before I go and I think it ties into geopolitics it's going on today and I really do believe that\nManiacs in I I don't want to use the who share the deep state I was home uh I Would call them the maniacal money pours I can tell you that on line\nAnd the ... maniacal money horrors of the world there are going to bring that about because they know said China and Russia to hold outs Iran of course the satellite state and they've said you were going to fall down to us and you are going to accept our ways you can accept or corporation and all of our norms\nAre those are going to be a war and\nWho and yesterday most American you missed it when he said if you did you catch that Richard when he said Russians when the war crimes if we get attacked she said we're going to\nGo to heaven because Russians now if I didn't catch that that's right you're right\nYou Americans and the western or she said you all just drop dead where you stand\nYou said it will be no time to repent I heard that pretty dire warning\nAbout the girls and the girls in the fathers had yeah they're ... they're not going to suffer the suffering is going to end very verse\nThere are suffering as the very first of\nAll right Dan thank you so much for for sharing that as a as a dire warning but also a\nA really a testament to your courage twenty five years you've enjoyed the suffering and I appreciate your calling in and sharing that story with us a Joe is in Monterey, California Joe good morning\nRegarding Richard thank you for taking my call okay um I Do a lot of healing work a solo travel a healing or and or some of my clients um I get them to a traveled out of the body\nTo their past lives uh actually it's called a spiritual aggression or a spiritual travel they're not using the actual body they're using their soul or conscious um [noise]\nIt's a a super conscious mind as a soul is in the very high state ah as for the process of crossing over usually people come to a gate a gateway and are they are met either by their guide or maybe a family member\nUm if they don't cross over a they will either told to go back or maybe they make talked to someone and they usually come back into the body you know near to not have full death experience\nBut there are books written about life between lives his what which I Do like between allies [noise] although most people don't do that they don't call on me to help them do that they rather do some healing were\nAnd some of the things that we do is work with angels and arcane rules and they're healers and

I have a dry de Coeur only drive it when that are on\nThe side but I that's what I tell people when they borrow my car don't go through a pot [laughter]\nOr at least you know what to do not terrific to have a great day Cheryl appreciate the call one eight hundred eight five nine zero nine five seven let's go now to Aaron Aaron as a two thousand one dodge ram pickup how many miles on your pickup truck there Aaron\nAs about a hundred and twenty five thousand\nRight very good and today you're calling about your transmission how can we help you\nYeah so it's a pretty strange uh it's kind of an intermittent problem and ah sometimes it won't shipped out of first year and I noticed that happens usually when I'm about empty a on gas and\nI'll pull into a gas station and all fill it up all the way\nAnd then um I leave the gas station and it starts to ship normal again\nOkay any check engine lights come on or anything different other than ah the little fuel\nI'm no nothing different I mean there is a check engine light on I mean it it kind of an on\nYeah but you know what why it sounded you know the code or what are the reason why is it a a mission control problem do you know any idea\nUm no I did check it a while back and I I forgot what it was okay but it is\nWell that does help if you would know but on this issue this is what I think what's going on so you're low on fuel your engine in your transmission work as a team will say for an example that you're running out of fuel or it's running lean\nThe transmission is not going to shift until it has the available fuel pressure in order for the engine power to go up for the transmission to shift is going into what we call them limp in mode\nAnd you would know that if your check engine light was not on normally it would go on to let you know that that was a problem in that particular point could be a lot of different things in your it should be just your your fuel pickup in the in the fuel tank\nUh for some reason has been is been pushed up and and left pushed up so it's it's getting half the fuel and that's why it's running lean so I'm going to tell you something and this particular case it's going to sound really strange and that is never let it go below a quarter of a tank\nOr a four have the fuel pump and and that replaced while they're in there because it's not much more money it's all labor or and then have them find out a lot of times people put too much feel and their tank even once or twice in the middle of summer\nBut what I mean by that it it pushes the hops out it puffs out and when that does what happens is it puts a bigger gap between the fuel pick up and the fuel itself and that's probably what's happened in your case\nOkay All right so it's nothing serious but get your check engine like [noise] six you know find out what it is because you can as something that's costing you a lot of money in the long run with fuel economy\nRight okay so that I won't I won't ah yell at you too\nBad how do you how do you use the truck is it's a for pushing snow overhauling or\nIt's just a an old work about okay\nI appreciate it or have a good day for your call let's go to Jeff Jeff hands and only Pontiac G\nG six yeah and how many miles on her there Jeffrey I brought it use and you won't believe it but it's got twenty seven thousand miles wow that's great what color are like ...\nHigh so only by a power steering what's what's going on with it\nOK what happens is when I got the car driving around for a week everything was fine and every so often when I'm driving down the road it's almost like the power steering goes out comes back in Congress during those out\nIt goes back in and then it can be fine for you know a day or so and there's no rhyme or reason when it comes down in the shop a couple of times [noise] the problem is when you take this shop it's not doing it [noise]\nRight right now let me ask you a question does the steering wheel when you're when that happens doesn't ever rock back and forth left the house so it rocks okay so here's the other issue\nThere's two types of power steering systems that could be on that vehicle one is a hydraulic where if you look down at the engine you're going to see a reservoir for so you can check your power steering while this one as electric okay that's the next thing the next one is is it's electric well what what is probably happen okay you bought this uh\nWith low mileage have you um did you have any type of a middle seat tires replaced or any alignment work\nYes they in fact when I got the car theater placed on tires\nOkay so here's what can happen okay this is a\nCritical because of electronics okay stay replace the tires and at the same time every place that most tiger shops will say hey you know why let's protect your investment\nOK latched instead of just putting the tires on let's let's check the climate and maybe in your case it needed a four wheel line that's OK okay any time that the movie's high rod ins and outs left right or whatever they did or change camper\nA there is a procedure you have to do where you have to reach that it's called you all why a W L\nI mean what it is your car probably has stability control in what it does it tells the the computer that you're going straight down the road and you have to be done on so if the in line was off\nThey put the tires on and they did not do a reset\nYou will have that problem where you'll lose your steering and like I said then you'll actually let me know if it does that say well here's the cars now David even moving you see the steering wheel rocking by itself left and right\nNow all the time ... will do that\nSo here's what you need to do you need to have an steering censor\nIf they can't reset it it has to be leaks laced if it has to be replaced it's four hundred dollars a habit it oh\nYes you'll yell [laughter]\nThere you go thanks for the call there's yes\nWe are the one the only the original we are leaving her show\nAnd actually they can be stressful it's soaking getting your car repair\nOur friends with car star at provided a comprehensive list of either of you should consider torture your vehicle was repair correctly not spending at least thirty minutes to complete the process\nCollege repairs can be complex review the vehicle with the person who wrote the estimate or were delivered to repair ask questions and take the time necessary to examine the repair there's also a good idea to compare the original watched about what the final bill\nThe engine rpm should go up to maybe eleven hundred twelve hundred and they should drop down to seven fifty or the the L K and then when you place it in drive\nOr it should still stay at seven and said did you know if it ever drops below seven hundred and fifty\nYeah it'll it'll be at six fifty sometimes you know like in ... and just sitting there in neutral here maybe as I go to ... to watch that I leave it on because it tells me right what you know what may happen has happened\nHere's what you need to do you need to have the fuel system queens you're going to have to have the throttle body cleaned the mass Airflow censor ah upper induction system and if you do if you were around that mileage points whereas there's a hundred thousand miles on spark plugs which are going to want to do is do this aggressive cleaning\nAnd then after the cleaning gonna wanna probably drive it for a week or so and have spark plugs change them so we don't want to do is to replace spark plugs and contaminated with these chemicals for cleaning the system you'll find out after this cleaning\nMost likely the stalling problem will go away because you haven't mentioned anything about a check engine light and uh you should watch though again you know a lot of people don't pay any attention to it but you should really\nYou know when he started you watch it goes up to twelve hundred should hang in there a little bit and slowly creep down in many cases you may not even see that rpm change which is in the Haitian that the throttle body and the fuel systems extremely dirty okay\nRight ... that the throttle body and the fuel systems extremely dirty\nOkay I Do get a service steering system\nOkay the slant on now here we go again\nRunning at a low idle speed and if you're running at a low idle speed that can create that problem too because he engine rpm isn't that fast keep in mind that every time you make a turn the power steering pressure switch kicks singer loading everything down you've got your air conditioning on you've got other components that put a load on the engine\nSo what's the computer sings at the engine rpm are too low so that service code may go away when you resolve the problem with the engine idle speed or you know running\nA at warm temperature in dry it should always read about seven hundred seven hundred and fifty\nRight okay and someone says like the the switch and the steering system or something that needs to be replaced\nNow know that actually tells you that it's working because what it's doing is commanding it should be commanding the computer to increase anytime you put a load on your turn the AC on the engine rpm should go up you turn on the steering wheel the computer takes oh any time there's an rpm drop it should increase it back up\nThe or is that what they're talking about is a transducers or or switch whatever you want to call it but if that weren't working then you'd you'd really know it and it would have happened all at once we think that it's a long term thing and now you're just at that point where now it's really critical and you need to get everything cleaned and bring it up to\nAnd after that it's all done one of the things that come to mind to as you if you had the idol speak control motor that's no longer working a correctly a vet could be the cause of it too but you still want to have the cleaning done in as the cleaning done that will help the idol speak control motor work to write the missing often\nCalled like a major cleaning or his or her now fuel injection cleaning you know you can happen to there's an induction system cleaning and the fuel system clean and you want both performed and what's often forgotten about on the on the back of your cars the fuel filter up underneath make sure that changed also\n... ... okay okay All right great very good

end up in order to have to know that that happened a couple of times and it went\nDown on us\nJob right now yeah\nMost likely the window motor has failed so you need to have the window lift motor replaced\nSo a new window lift motor for that do yes and how much is that going to be oh depends if he takes it somewhere probably about two hundred and fifty dollars signs and that will take care of
