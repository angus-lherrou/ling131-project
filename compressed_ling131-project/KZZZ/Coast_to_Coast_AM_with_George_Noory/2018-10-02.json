or they've got one they're getting the seat [laughter] and and done and do you have a specific question\nI really you know not really an overall okay well we're about\nTo give you the overview there with my computer I this is to take me I'm George hours when I'm doing now in in minutes the or in\nA union and you'd better be minutes on this show right could you imagine taking our\nOkay uh you have a it's interesting\nJust like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime you've developed leadership skills that you need to\nA recent lifetime you've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive\nSo there was a kind of forceful part but you our son sign Aquarius aquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things\nAre where you're ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three five less devising half record more than even when you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George you know something really fortuitous good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of said you're terrorists well here's somebody and Donna you're\nBorn with ... so it's going to be homecoming for you all over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn so do something in the world or something you know where you're making\nA expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant and and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know if the doctor thing whatever it is and it's right then you'd say okay\nUh looked serious enough that you know we're going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit for how long you know and then come back to me it\nCould be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is is still magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook\nBut when you have done it for forty six years you know it they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to charge themselves right into the sea the directions are going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say this I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts\nOf compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nKoppel's ever come to you mark to say are we compatible with well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage charting really\nYeah it ... but the thing is it's a very fine tuned I'm there we have a ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something call ... so I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things\nIs ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get background information both people but basically a scholar does have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for lots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human Sharon card\n[noise] well I've created to\nTo row decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did enter trial courts which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of promotion of that and then I did baseball Toronto and I just ran into the gal Laura Philips\nThe other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of doing calendars but they had never done a trail projects so I've done to row longer than I've done a strategy\nI'm going to give you our next a special callers birthday first of all November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Radley do you know where\nYou were

we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we are going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth which Gordon war go ahead mark\nOkay so November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person has a son signed Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another moon in areas that that is really took\nThat's not so unusual ... yeah I mean there are twelve times three callers all within areas man that's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy people of his son side Scorpio need to really get into the things\nI'm sort of in a hot and heavy weight and stay with it\nDo you pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I I often enter you know

astrological chart\n[laughter] um [noise] I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy ya gotta Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and a credible gotten it for a long time\nWisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible government for a long time and they just had and the previous issue where there's a a free program I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get which I think is really unique where people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult of planet or star and even\nAn asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like there's one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones um there there may be some effect with some people I think more cyclical you the people who like are prone to\nYou know respond to earth changes you know some people tune into earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark\nI'm happy I'm coming birthday to you my friend\nOh well thank you very another year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money laundering money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay uh by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra hot and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and saw something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune for Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon and the moon was also in the ... sign cancer and is rising\nIn the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype of areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a Pisces ...\nAnd ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing I'm\nMore of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leave for a lever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a of a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime of cancer Leo Virgo and leave right so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of law about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially and initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a lasting very and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt a and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\nAh no just uh how is my upcoming year looking\nWell Jupiter you have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems so get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems in developing strategic thinking\nAnd you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success\nPower of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nAnd to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nAnd that's not we're going into the Rockies November twenty in Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to forty in the morning a mark\nBoy you're going fast November

[laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of Aquarius ya\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on\nWhich was discovered in Nineteen Seventy seven and tire on is kind of the ... the mentor so this brings up the idea of getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint\nWhere you're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color your you're going to get the fortunate of Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship a creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you\nWith all of a sudden you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life I'm being a sun science Scorpio and

to it and uh hopefully it's my um it might be my swan song but I\nThink I may maybe about this subject and\nWhy do you think the government really not what we know why don't they don't\nWell I think they're coming close with this latest program out with the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come\nBut um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of a court case but uh I think that we have known all along\nWhere these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies what's I mean\nIt's it sounds like a far out thing it's not something keel would approve of it in his heyday\nA matter of fact the hell was reluctant to put out any of the occupation reports until I wrote the book strange effect from us so I was in Nineteen sixty nine

managed to do it twice since Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has some great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project matter of fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado us ... project because we are just symptom of just regimes of our um\nOut of some of our best cases\nAnd I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report chemo boot you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine and from that time on all the funding for a night cap a went out and then a\nA a there was not kept staff member who was also had the CIA connections and\nI think the CIA had been trying to take over a for some time of course Roscoe, Illinois quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you see this she wanted to do like Washington\n[noise] well I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call I didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon\nWho had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of\nI'm off balance because ah actually that was the one that\nBefore I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of curly over a period of several hours and\nUm so I think they knew all along that ah\nYou know but they have a certain amount of control over it but uh and and kill\nA\nI don't know I I just don't know how much keyhole really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was willing to let\nMy cab continue\nUm as long as they can monitor\nIt as long as they could monitor right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine\nWho fired you are but um I think it was a joke Brian he was a stay at CIA contact the did you\nSee the CIA member and the ... and and uh and Colonel Brian\nUm and also\nDo it for an a and a a heart transplant see a connection store next to the news of the the a plant in the office

was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who had the authority to let you go to you too you said that's correct\nWho had the authority to let you go and she said\nThat's correct he is the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that the we had a board of governors\nAnd I'm In early sixty nine they appointed a key how the president or not he was the director first they appointed and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nAnd uh um but and by the end of last year it took less than a year for them to a closed down the organization but I think they had been a\nA a a\nReally monitoring us all along not far we haven't even thought the Airforce and won a kale and I were on the phone now

welcome back to the program\nOh thank you George glad to be here looking for is that your only website where do you have others do we just started a great ... enterprises that that's what I Want her\nTo a seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the art very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA great pair enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master and Web designer it looks very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going out to Langley well that that's what we've got a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning things with the e books and other kinds of things to be sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago when when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa ... who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest easy mundane astrologer right\nAnd I went what what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology\nIf the strategy of nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moons full moon major planetary alignment in other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same plan a\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there well\nAgain kind of it's the maker causing rather than microcosm so\nPeople who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of where I was they read the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sport like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was\nI was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMarch tell us exactly what is ... is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a uh being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgyptian Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly there was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm of the modern astrology [laughter] we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied\nAll kinds of things we regarding Atlantis or when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics lived at the pinpoint community after\nSpending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo\nNothing the pilots just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its\nNormal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in ...\nOrange but all the planets will tend to appear\nTo go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and it kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's like confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if you if I went to Google as far as one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear and then you click on images it's their little George with all kinds of things like stop science and wrote signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people\nAre actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers ... would you have five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same charter somebody or the same event\nYou ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want\nTo hear a prediction was you're going to go however\nAstrology really works best in terms of ... ... as you said and he's studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use the scope before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of is like I'll meet you at\nTen o'clock in the morning at such and such a place\nSo that people think of time has kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts\nAnd at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of ... and the U.S trawler puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but ... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most of the straw measures kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar results\nAre huge psychic too or just the Charlotte I'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out\nTo the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance do walk on the planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focus that's why the mundane astrology virtual things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic and intuitive\nBut I don't draw tested but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports rushed logically psychic stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer in his website great beer enterprises dot com or\nNote the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that\nThe the people call this planet or in if you're on a ... you were in its depending on their pronunciation but that part of the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one\nWhen the American revolution was one of the same year that Iran is was cited by William Herschel and ironically and bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into tore okay and tourists as the main side of money\nAnd stop the stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in a oh five years or you're on a spends about seven years\nOh five years or you're on a spends about seven years in a sign that planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional\nSoda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six he get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kind of thing is like a a nation's chart\nOf nations are born like people if you can locate the birth of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now what am I correct zones\nNow cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not\nJust astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water\nSo to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know\nWhat what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merge together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air sides and the point here is that crypto currency is on more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA serial that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes\nYeah I guess you could say that\nA very stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parent prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zones so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius new segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well then you can you predict if he I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend who said that he was drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes does on people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it's the thing is going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of Monday and astrology is always a little bit of a personal though you can do that\nAnd I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a chart just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nHis very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nJenna put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's gonna get confirmed astrological each speaking\nWell okay here's the ...\nConfirmed astrological each speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus into science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well yeah\nWell the thing is is that there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing for to be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if something like that it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there the squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was alert you think you'll get confirmed Yvonne\nI'm asking the logically speaking well\nEsther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nThem used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that's probably that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll I'll say no you at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors of you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college than Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this will this will be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you've caught that did you see that\nNew Hampshire did it was like well wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they dragging their feet and then during so I don't know if it was a late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing his trek\nExactly so you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology this is very important Donald Trump's chart President Trump's chart is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talk about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong il on\nTheir report to his border Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five is definitely a Capricorn son we know that we just don't know the year and I think

we just started a great bear enterprises that that's what I ever to\nA seven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the yard very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape or enterprises my daughter has just been on the Web master and Web designer it looks very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what do you run up to lately well then that's what we've had a full time right\nWell pretty much um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning things with the e books and other kinds of things that we've sort of been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world that says I'm going to give you a special guest easy mundane astrologer right and I went like what what are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much it's it's really earth astrology global astrology it's the astrology of nations of world leaders things like eclipse is new moons full moons major planetary alignment\nIn other words that's kinda the opposite to doing personal horoscope readings although I've I've been doing that\nJust as long um so the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results that same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWell again kind of it's the maker causing rather than microcosm so\nPeople who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things are they prefer to look at the big picture\nOf national events current events the way the world is and when I was growing up it's just kind of where I was I read the the ... the world book\nUm you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year we'd come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course\nA President Kennedy came into office with the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation and the world probably because of that particular event\nMarked tell us exactly what is strongly gee is [noise]\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a ... of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgypt and Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who was also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied\nAll kinds of things we regarding that laughter is uh when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation\nMeditation metaphysics lived at the pinpoint community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde planets what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo\nNothing the planets just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun\nUm we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away and the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear to go in reverse from our vantage point it's kind of like\nA this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station and you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours is going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you and it kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're\nKind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's confusing\nWell that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion so what most people have tuned into over the decades\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that at Eighteen if you if I went to Google or as far as one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear [laughter] and then you click on images it's their little George with all kinds of things like stop science and wrote signs saying mercury recreate don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going to reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers would you get five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades\nVery intensively if you had say a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same charter somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and\nOften you know people want to hear a prediction you're going to go\nHowever astrology really works best in terms of ... ... as you said and he's studied it I'm not just psychology and UFOs and\n... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time\nShould not be thought of as like I'll meet you at\nTen o'clock in the morning at such and such place so that people think of time has kind of a convenient system\nIt's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts and at their first moments that they pick their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of the ... and the U.S trawler puts it altogether\nAnd reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\nSolar energy lunar energy and climate or energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above and below so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most of the straw measures kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just the Charlotte I'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the\nPublic my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be a for instance do welcome to planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes\nMarketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the mundane astrology or not church will things\nAnd so I'm fundamentally um I ... which is interesting you ask me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcasted but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports rushed a logical psychic like okay stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer does this website great beer enterprises dot com or\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though is that\nThe the people call this planet or in if you're on a ... year reign of depending on their pronunciation but that planet the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one\nWhen the American revolution was one is in the same year that Iran is was cited by William Herschel and ironically and bath England um but at any rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main sign of money\nAnd the New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two\nAnd so not yet but in oh five years or Iran and spends about seven years in the fine\nThat planet which is a planet of extreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock\nExchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year but it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back\nUh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six to get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three and that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kind of thing was like a nation's chart\nOf nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including a probably market changes but I don't see it right now\nWhat about Chris zones\nNow cryptic does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred Ninety four years\nThe ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which was the largest planets they've been actually looked at by people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient\nPeople were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything\nExactly to a degree of ... but basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius and then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air sides and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA serial that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately yes yeah I guess you could say that a\nVery stormy and um I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called the astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on grey parrot prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zones so now earth of course news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grape or enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call them a friend who said that the user drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother die from alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum or the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not\nUm he could withdraw I mean you know it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday I don't think it's I think it's going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology\nAlways a little bit of a person although you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a charge just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nJenna put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed astrological eat speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexuality Venus is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week he keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen well\nWell the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I Would hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative as somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nSo it's not as if it would be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that is squeaky clean\nWell I think that would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was alert you think you'll get confirmed Yvonne\nI'm asking the logically speaking\nWell Esther logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nOf hazard a guess on that that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me though I think it will get confirmed do you do okay All right that that that that might be one I I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll I'll say no you at least you took a stand right\nBecause when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably went on she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan\nWisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million and that turned the election to the electoral college than Trump won\nSo amazing work now ... let's talk about Kim Jong on in his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think it's happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this'll this'll be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation I think it's a done deal that they're going to have nuclear weapons and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing um in other words it will be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false one or not a kind of you do these kind of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day or the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of

things\nAre where you're ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three you have five less devising half record more than even when you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George you know something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of ... well here's somebody Donna\nYou're born with Jupiter and Saturn ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn so do something in the world or something you know where you're making\n'em expressing yourself in society

everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is\nThat's right then you'd say okay uh looked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit well for how long you know and then come back to me it could be a pneumonia it\nMight be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is is so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces and there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook\nBut when you have done it for forty six years you know it's they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be walking on planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or a month or less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the sea the directions are going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying and I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could\nDo couples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage ... really\nYeah but the thing is it's a very fine\nTuned I'm there we have a

that relatively quickly for me to do things is you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get background information both people\nBut basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for lots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human too real card [noise]\nWell I've created to erode decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did in her trial courts which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like

believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another moon in areas that that is really took\nThat's not so unusual ... yeah I mean there are twelve five three callers all within areas man\nThat's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conjunction Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled the water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of difference energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently in Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is Marjorie so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his son science Scorpio need to really get into these things\nI'm sort of it a hot and heavy way and stay with

astrological chart\nUm [noise]\nI don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy young out of Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible gotten it for a long time and they just had it in the previous issue with there's a a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to yet\nWhich I think is really unique with that people can the uh they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a cult a planet or star and even an ass\nThat is a cult of planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but media you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like there's one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones um there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible but it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert\nHey good evening George good evening mark happy I'm coming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you very another year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money the money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay a ... by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic strategy which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra hot and there's what's called parts like the part of the of earth part of marriage and saw something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune\nFor Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also is the moon as an aside cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is the kind of archetype of areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a ...\nAnd ... is from from the path from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and path okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership lever and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric Lee for leverage is I Choose the way that leads to be ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm dating Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of lie on the head of a it'd be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of law about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiates you know two thousand years ago during those last years from\nYou know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three going all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass and very and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\nNo just uh how is my upcoming year looking\nWell Jupiter you have for planets\nCelestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is kind of tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems to get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems in developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but they ... their gifts from the heavens to Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success however positive thinking faith

building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before

it's also you're at an age where you're honest as making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid his nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology or on that

fillet at the Northwestern University a night Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd and by then a high and they had already decided that indeed the UFO question needed a serious scientific investigation and\nAnd and he was no longer going to pooh pooh it as something or you know\nWhat was it didn't change to Gordon just because something dramatic happened to more he went from being the project Blue Book consultant which was basically deny deny deny knew all of a sudden a staunch believer in UFOs even having his own organization out of Chicago\nUh-huh I mean what what was that trigger points for him that gun I yeah I always heard it was the ... the police officer on should be a great\nCase they really did April twenty fourth Nineteen sixty four and I kept at a thorough investigation that case

Nineteen fifty eight he was interested he interviewed key but they're all they're always seemed to be censorship going on there but\nI Know well I I can tell you back and uh and sixty seven are doing

eight that went back um the I I went back\nBefore the Kenneth Arnold case ha ha there and matter of fact I went into the national archives in Washington DC and town ships are wailing shipped captains log\nThat actually described in his own handwriting a disk that came out of this guy went down into the water came back up again\nAnd then circled the ship and then that off at a tremendous to it and and this was like in Eighteen forty eight or something like that and there was another case that I found also in the national archives\nIn the seventeenth century where um\nI uh some men were rafting a a a ... or trying to paddle a raft down the muddy river\nAh in in Massachusetts\nWhen they saw this huge addicts this that came out of the sky I started drawing the raft up\nRiver against it and then it ... it lifted up out of the air for a little bit plopped it back down into the water and took off disappear he how can you have a lot of those things and and a lot of that was um in my book mysteries of the skies UFOs in perspective\nYou know people like John Mack and\nThe no I didn't know John Mack and all that if I say I took it for about Nineteen eighty to ah to when I started this book of working on this book about two years ago so I was sort of out of a new one on the other things other careers as a writer and editor and I wasn't much\nUntil they are really a constant day by

flying saucers from beyond the earth is website is his name and it's linked up and goes to goes to some of these cases in your book or just bring back just amazing memories\nI used to remember how excited I was every time I read a brand new UFO story in just looking at them and flying saucers from beyond your direct elect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I I took her three through the years and I've I've been a ... I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally got around to it and uh\nHopefully it's my uh it may be much on the phone but I think I may maybe about this subject\nAnd why do you think the government really has not just lose what we know why don't they tell them\nWell I think they are coming close with this latest program that will the Pentagon and I think it's the closest I've ever come\nBut um I have a theory that if if if it may sound kind of\nA court case but uh I think that we have known all along where these uh uh saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technology is what's the name\nIt's it sounds like a far out thing is that something kill would approve of it in his heyday [laughter]\nA matter of fact Campbell was reluctant put out any of the occupation reports until I wrote the boat strange effect from UFOs in Nineteen sixty nine which was really and I kept publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the occupation cases and uh and and and things like that but of course is the main focus was to get to ... hearings he managed to do it twice and sick Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has the great hopes for the University of Colorado a UFO project in fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO prod project because the way a symptom of disarray\nAims of our um out of some of our best cases and I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the ... report came out tons of food do you suppose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine\nAnd from that\nTime on all the funding for a night cap a went out and then a a a there was an knockout staff member who was also had the CIA connection and\nI think to say I had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe Ellen ... who was the first chairman of the night cap board after ... took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you think to see how you wanted to do now I can\nJust wash it\nWell I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call a didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon who had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason\nMe that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it um which which struck me kind of\nI'm off balance because uh actually that was the one that\nBefore I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three where to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of early over a period of several hours and\nUm\nSo I think they knew all along that uh you know but they have a certain amount of control over it but uh and and kill\nA\nI don't know I I just don't know how much K O really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was\nWilling to lead and I kept continue um\nAs long as they can monitor it as long as they could monitor right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine who fired\nA ... um I think it was a joke Brian he was a stay at CIA contact the did you and I'm like I'm a seat CIA member and the ... and and uh and Colonel Brian\nUm and also\nDo it for an a and a a heart transplant and see a connection store next to the news of the the a plant in the office had CIA connections\nAnd uh I think they were just trying to see how they could eventually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nI mean wasn't my independent private organization\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who have the authority to let you go and kill too you\nSaid that's correct he is the founder\nYeah I Know but but the thing is that see we had a board of governors\nAnd I'm In early sixty nine they appointed a key how the president or not he was the director first they appointed and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call at that time had left and taken a more lucrative position\nAnd uh uh but and by the end of last year it took less than a year for them to a closed down the uh organization but I think they had been a\nA a a\nReally monitoring us all along metro we haven't even thought the Airforce and one or the kale and I were on the phone and I can't hold lived a hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't on the office and all that often maybe once every two months or so [noise]\nUh and we were talking about a UFO case\nAnd with all of a sudden we got to click on the phone and we heard a voice has said well major Quintanilla this has done ... of course accurate quite mellow was the air force spokesman at the time\nAnd then we had another cat a situation where he wanted a to ask me if I were joined with him and creating a totally false case\nHave nothing happened to be a ... and so we created a case where UFO had landed but there were occupancy and there were special effects their electoral magnetic uh affects aliens walking around and they actually showed up at a and one of the project Blue Book reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we published the project grudge and Blue Book before so it was the first time we were able to get those reports shaken loose from uh the air force of through the freedom of Information Act\n... did you ever know I'm In the late ... fourteen astronaut gr Mitchell\nSo no I didn't know I'm a director I Know of course but he had a UFOs fighting I Know\nWe are we knew him was launched believe news\nThat's what I understand knowledge was\nUm again when I was Twenty one years old I interviewed Dr Benjamin Simon you recall that name\nI knew that in Barney hill that psychiatry that's right that's\nRight that that got hypnotized them and that was a case and I have um investigative thoroughly hit they had a huge file on it but here again there was another case a key who didn't want to get out because he he he you know he was trying to persuade Congress to hold hearings", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "02"}
