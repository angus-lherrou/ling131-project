all the time I Would never extend false hope\nBut the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things\nVery often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou said that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was one habit on George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you were going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they have they didn't have a few good song\nThey really did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no\nAnd he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no\nHe said well we'd like you to in a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the interest that and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material it was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose from linear time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak with my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dolan that's right who played Sherk is boy on television\nRight that's right and and still touring still touring yeah who is still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the named Joseph gallon burger money chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas ... groups of people mhm any which you're trying to prove\nThat positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's\nRyan and he is totally convinced and he's convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just bury this and the footnote of a book with its monumental\nThat when his subjects in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were downcast when they were fatigue their scores death and it was inevitable\nSpike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting a black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to me Shirley identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle of a little bit later on in the program his website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a board\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and that's what's driving my historical research why don't I write about the methods why don't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind that\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George and lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them\nThings that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated\nAnd clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that\nDoesn't mean we don't live under many laws enforces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs it the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thoughts change the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if fought changes the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWhen we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel dejected one of the things that I write about in the book is that we live\nWithin a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity\nBut you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way\nCircumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're Horton that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nAre going to come back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle club\nNext hour and we'll take phone calls questions and miracle stories [noise]\nShe's

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWon't come back to coast to coast George George with your along with rich Horwitz as we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle club Paul thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories next hour as well how does he is pretty fit into the mix you were talking about it briefly\nHow does ESP fit into this mess you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted high in here\nYeah oh there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments that the ESP creek technician telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the S P lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways that\nWe receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence outside the sense a body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize\nWe are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people\nTo help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us halfway and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. rhyme that grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important\nYour thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must want it with everything and you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what you want\nOver time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves what we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging people might urging people and this was something list ers can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest once\nThink about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it be intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really\nPassionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secret that story or is that different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental soup for law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous\nSegment so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nIt can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because\nYou know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time\nLinear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we used to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now\nThere is in and finish a tube of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful\nThe young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut in all in the apple stock that's where they come back well [laughter]\nWell who knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you've said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge\nThe thirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge that for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as\nProductive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult\nAnd if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you give thirty days to the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time\nYou could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will visualize a list of people who have written in yes we're on the prayer list for whatever they need a new job in a selection\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know you sick and stuff like that anyway wonderful how powerful do you believe and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back after the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that\nBut how powerful deeply prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed than facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that aren't prescribing they can't direct their mind in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it\nThere are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance that's one prayer comes in that one prayer comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of her own psyche from the difficulties of life's circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch from our own psyche so again I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework\nThe tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds and the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from Greek and they can't do the things I'm saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a special section prayer in the marrow clubs\nIs the one as powerful as many when you are dealing with miracles\nBut did you know when you donate stuffed good will you

and not slip back into complaining are taking life for granted that's the challenge that we face in life\nLet's go to Keith in Rochester New York Yankees go ahead\nI yes I have several questions for Mr Horwitz class envy usually is not good but there are these persistent studies that show that home your family is now where you're born ... really do determine where you end up in life\nI see this all the time I got myself a hard fast city resident and\nEven though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this will lead me to my second question ah people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I wanted to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in school Harry New York we're ...\nOr ... I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one\nBecause there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap but these those people Mr Horwitz of the\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end and yet you say a from a higher exalted background that people should know but that that they were like many people and society they\nThey were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there ... there were twenty people killed Eighteen in limbo not one spoke up to say this has got to stop\nPull over now and they could have but they didn't like she\nDoes say it they went to their deaths sort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city\nAnd seen my fellow city residents ... many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in ... Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this that and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd let me let me ask you because we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by to tell somebody to stop what was going on inside the blue mold ...\nThere are indications that the the car was basically used my term coming apart that the uh people were saying\nUh amongst the victims because they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk to\nThe car was being coming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough of for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher ... middle class of jobs where they should\nHave had the smarts the know how just to say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me teeth oh that driver would have pulled over no if fans who are\nNow I I Would have wanted to be in a limo would you you wouldn't stop the guy\nYou know with the there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep this thing and of course I I read the same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I'd break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been eluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces of never including love accident including accidents birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force than it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think\nIs dangerous it's vitally vitally important that everybody act with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates that participates in other things\nThat are going on and it is extremely important to exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you\nAnd I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool in your belt that you can always\nBut the fact is the mind is one vital tool in your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment\nIt is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind as extra physical properties that doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything and every force that occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment\nAs Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be hazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to Thomas a little while you're

talked about his words the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work much in what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that I Would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road tested and treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self\nThat's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination I write about this and the final chapter of the miracle club at once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once if you can actually enter into a relapse meditative state and\nPicture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the present but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson\nSo reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene\nImagine yourself in that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch how does it work\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question\nThe fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select things I think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time\nOn that grid we experience it as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so our actual act of life\nIs an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things\nThe way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle steak select\nVery carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Mary in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line ... go ahead\nHello there jarred what a pleasure thank you sir yes\nChart which water or it is to hear you on the air I Love it when you're all

something just hit me and said George you haven't you have an email to ... you know while eating back on the show and you were really receptive in here you are but I've got to tell you a great story you've\nBeen on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me\nYou did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that more working the whole by the radio in the end you did this incredible thing and I got an email that night in the following week from people who said oh my God my watch is working it hasn't worked in years\nThe funny part about all this ... years later we re ran part of that program on our weekend shows\nAnd I started getting emails from people after that Shane George my watches are working my clock is working and I'm going much going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we in rerun that show a couple of days before that\nThe power of what you did was unbelievable\nYes you know George ... of people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken wants his old clothes and by the way we we can if you wish we can repeat\nThe same experience and so people think that he's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves and and they come out of the radio and television but it it's really know\nWhat I Do even simply trigger I'm I'm simply a cap at least to the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers on big T. V. shows these has actually worked\nStarted my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first big television show and\nThey handed me for two band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera and I said everybody at home go and get your spoons\nAnd get\nBroken watches I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen because everyone wanted to experience this\nPhenomena first of all no one believed that spoons and folks are going to bend and watches we've come alive but they nevertheless they brought this food they broke broken launches in ... and I mean it was messy and then I did my my thing I\nSaid one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work and lo and behold\nIf the federal money Kurd exactly what happened to you people from all over England way of in Scotland and Ireland [noise] you know there you you didn't have then um you know Twitter in face\nTime and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more\nMy phone was old fashioned black phone\nAnd what happened is the BBC's ... system couldn't take the hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain any collapse and the next day of course I was kind of the most\nFamous person in in England the the the newspapers ran headline stories or we get our puts England in a band\nSo ... years George I thought that I did it\nI really believe that I admitted in energy that fix broken clocks and Ben spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles\nUCLA and dumped Thelma most ... vice took me to her class and of course I did my my act\nAnd I left when I didn't know George is that she secretly recorded me while and I went back to New York two weeks later she took that\nHeavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy\nShe took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six [noise] and she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of pupils student we've broken want you\nAnd lo and behold there watches started taking from that video now she calls me in New York and she tells the story you just fix broken watches\nThose fabulous and I said no way what are you talking about\nI mean New York I didn't even know that you you're doing these experiments and that's when he don't want to me that it's basically I ... I may have to leave I mean in may ... to\nThe power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people just we're just our gas was amazing I first met early Geller back around Nineteen Ninety seven and St Louis he was an invited guest at the\nJewish community center do you remember remember that time Henri yes I Do in a\nJust a great time the place was packed in a I got ... information and had him on my local show when I was a nice walk and\nWe've stayed friends ever since lots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay when it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus and you could see out we left because my parents divorced\nMy mother remarried ... Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the Cyprus yes and he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel\nWith a Thirteen rooms and more found these rhyming damage and services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel into ... into a more safe house oh\nSpies would come into the hotel they would check under you know teachers geology ... but they were really more of the agents that were from Cyprus where\nA flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd they weren't problem since ... if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about Cypriots fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blowing up I I\nI mean ... out of Mormons\nI've seen everything uh curfews bums exploding ah so\nBeing at that age it really changes your life so I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing ... the British soldier the Turks were killing the Greeks but why all this was going on I was a I befriended the Mossad agent who told me to you know run errands for\nHim he would send me letters we she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump on the bicycling psycho\nThem to the conflict in the Israeli conflict anyhow the reason I told you the story is because I already was excited about you know the the then life for ... office by yeah and I love movies so [noise] to make a long story short um when I became kind of\nWell known in Israel I met Tom Goldman Meyer who is the\nPrime minister right [noise]\nAnd she introduced me to Ari Sharon you know these are all your gender rose in that they aren't sure and introduced me to the television um community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break and let's come back and pick that up right from there\nBecause you truly ruined the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the three Geller the paranormal as The Mentalist next on coast to coast day in\nThe woods I didn't know streamlined for mobile devices great news if your ... simply want to enjoy our website on your phone visit ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd George already back with you on the coast to coast along with the ... next hour get your watches and you're broken clocks together will do an experiment with Marie\nAnd see if we can get those working for you but there are a you're talking about how you were with really the the leaders of Israel golden my year our real Sharon who ended up being the prime minister and then went into a coma lessons for longer than I ever thought he would but they they they recruited you basically didn't they\nYes they introduce me to the head of a more ... uh they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we one going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my ability\nIf they introduce me to the head of a most out or they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities and they picked up the phone in the cold the CIA and it was a CIA\nScientists quote kitten green who took the call you basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of forward gather produced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it um my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me\nThey wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how can they put the occurs\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left is where it straight to California\nTo Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University\nAnd I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition test a and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago\nI asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concern me and it was amazing the ... you know the press to hold of this story any ... worldwide\nYes and uh in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parity cages are there there was experiments where kids green held\nA book in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phones then and no Twitter and Instagram and I basically drool worked that was in the book and he also worked on that page um their word architectural and I wrote the same word\nIn Palo Alto in California so yeah that's the answer that I worked very hard that we these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were a United States touring and uh you know when I was watching you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but then he he you know kind of um ... into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee\nFlew me to Geneva we've invested their max campus then\nI'm next to me stood Al Gore and I was instructed to boom barred usually vote on so to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course I was briefed by by these people in London\nAnd um I go to a very close to your early vote on so I mean I was inches away from his head and I ... I Know it sounds so far out in\n... in science fiction but I did exactly that I'd bombarded these mind to sign sign sign and they sign they knew the nuclear arms reduction treaty of course I Can't\nClaim that I eat eat only happen because of me there are other elements involved but I was definitely an instigator I was in motivator and I use these powers to convince the Russians to go ahead and signed a treaty\nAbout a year ago President Trump release some JFK documents and then later on released some more there's still a lot that still have bench press Henri but\nSure enough we uh we read that worry Geller was asked to look at the JFK files\nYes what happened is why I was I'm working for some CIA\nOperators and my handler is in Mexico city it was very kind of genius how they got me into Mexico I was introduced to the president of Mexico or look ... and his wife or\nHis wife was kind of fell in love with the powers and you know she loves the paranormal in the supernatural

I was asked to spy on the Russian\nEmbassy in Mexico city to see who goes in who goes out where there were there American spies\nGoing in um people who betrayed the country and so forth and one of my tasks was to find out these new Harvey all vote actually visited that that embassy or consulate\nThere was some controversy about that because there was a picture of what was supposed to be Lee Harvey Oswald [laughter]\nOne of my tasks walls to find out from the Harvey all vote actually visited that that embassy or consulate\nThere was some controversy about that because there was a picture of what was supposed to be Lee Harvey Oswald coming outside of the embassy but a lot of people were you said that's not him but so go ahead\nYeah well that was my task was to tell them whether that was him or not\nBut there there were more more and much deep for things in in Mexico that I did for the CIA [noise] it was amazing I I actually love the by the way I never got paid for these I did it out of ideological or reasons and I love these\nShowbiz nascent cloak and dagger are there I was on Johnny Carson in Merv Griffin Mike Douglas and then yet I was\nDoing these secret stuff\nFor also for him I

are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely you know why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting\nEvents all the time from across in and send it to the possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged\nThought and that's what's going on we are selecting and the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab\nYou're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces\nOr one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was one habit on George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what do they have they didn't have a few good song they\nReally did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no\nAnd he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the interest that and I said of course I'm interested in I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this\nI started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material it was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFrom linear time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seem to be off in the future so to speak with my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was that right long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dolan that's right who played Sherk is boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nThe yeah they're still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the name ... gallon burger money chance I don't ... wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas ... groups of people mhm any which\nIs trying to prove that positive thinking and the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's\nRyan and he is totally convinced and he's convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is\nOh you're going to win yes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook\nHas been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Ryan pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties JPEG is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book with its monumental that when his subjects in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigue their scores dipped and it was inevitable and spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting a black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to me surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize every chapter that I wrote every person who had talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and that that's what's driving my historical research why don't I write about the methods why don't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because\nA lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind that\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George and lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them\nThings that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments the day I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't\nMean we don't live under many laws enforces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts changed the brain\nYour sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so of thought changes the brain and fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel dejected one of the things that I write about in the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces\nThe law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way\nCircumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're more than that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nMisery are going to come back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle slums\nI Know about title fraud sore register with home title walk and discovered some they've had already taken over title thank God I found out of time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you hold title luck will for pennies per day old title walk puts a barrier around your own title and mortgage the interested it detects tampering there on it helping to shut it down find out if you're already\nTampering there on helping to shut it down find out if you're already a victim of title broad get your hundred dollars search free with somebody not visit home title luck dot com home title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George George with you along with Mitch Horwitz as we talk about his latest book which is called the miracle clubhouse thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does he is the kid into this mess you were talking about in briefly but uh I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYeah oh there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments that the ESP ... telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the S P lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five senses once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical that the mind has an existence outside the scent said body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize\nWe are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people\nTo help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us halfway\nAnd as I was mentioning in the last segment Jay be running the grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on\nYour emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must wanted with everything and you you must wanted with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because\nI Would contend that what you want over time you're going to get\nDo people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my\nUrging to people might urging to people and this is something list ers can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stained sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants\nThink about this well on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote\nAnd they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close do you echoed the secret that story corps at different\n... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for round burn and the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental soup for law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying in the previous\nSegment so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nIt can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you\nKnow we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time\nWhat would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time [noise] linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered in the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish two of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among the events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's when they come back to that well [laughter] well\nWho knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you've said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the thirty day mental challenge the\nThirty day mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listener who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge that for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that is\nProductive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities of the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult\nAnd if you fall off the horse you don't have to restart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction\nOf that which is positive and productive for thirty days see what happens when you give thirty days of the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time\nYou could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I
