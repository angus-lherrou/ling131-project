they know the public will demand retaliation and that and that is something that this president cannot do\nBill Clinton has very serious character flaws his modus operandi is to stall until the he

land hungry and money hungry and they built almost up to the edge of the Everglades now right and from time to time you'll hear\nStories like this a first of all because some of those towns that a fair to less than mine allow you to ah keep exotic animals\nPillow hair of huge pythons are right taking little dogs will here as a sure\nOne once I had a car out and have a got into a lot of trouble for that but people seem to have an affinity for collecting strange pets and then not really watching how they keep them\nBut they have been a number of terrible accidents over the years a child a was taken by a crocodile or this past year right out of a canal because people will get small crocodiles as a pet and when they get to dig they sell them and they can out\nWell but that's the natural well not the canals that's\nIt they're not supposed to be in their house no because uh this area is completely lined by now but I've never heard of a crocodile taking on a Lexus\nNo ah what I'm saying is that it while it's a little bit of a wild story or that have been small pets taken a whether the connection is to the fact that the animals have been attacked and the car it's been attacked nobody's quite sure at this point\nYeah ... well I tell you that you're not in for late night early morning till our older\nYou know you can't really cut some of the human animals that are walking around

stay and after dinner but it's it's a little bit of a frightening story parents apparently very worried about the small children well sure wish they should be\nBut a note that within a day or so they'll find out what it is because they usually do and if it's somebody who uh\nHas led to a pet a strange pet out there could have been a lot of travel\nWell not to say I appreciate your call thank you and if it's somebody who has adopted a baby was opera and allow this sucker to grow up and then because of the disagreeable nature of the ... his personality\nLet it lose they're going to be in a

amazed that I have twin boys and my boys both of them would have just profound experiences now it was it was amazing to me what they would do it\nNow it was it was amazing to me what they would do it night\nNo that's incredible I had one on now you say it's common even counter under in your experiences can you go back and read the he had a nightmare and you want to go back and you when you\nClose the and create a new ending she let her dream technique\nOh absolutely can you do that\nYou can a nightmare is ... is a reflection of your fear\nAnd during and it's a matter of fact that's a technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner you send loved to the fear during the out of body experience\nUm in other words you don't run from it you can from it and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear and you do it fully conscious not just in a dream\nBut imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully absolutely conscious\nAnd you do the same technique where you are literally dissipate in dissolving fears are blocks that's the great block for self knowledge is fear\nRight it's\nIt's a great block that all of us confront and one way or another it's it's an invisible box that everybody creates around themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to confront and dissipate and dissolve\nThose fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nAlthough he eighty six pretend to be on and you know here you know we're hearing out of money and they had a very peaceful and\nYes according to this survey\nHaiti [laughter] that's very high\nIt yes it was it was pretty high remember that a lot of people responding to me\nAlso were not um they were open to the experience to some degree I have to\nAcknowledge that that's a good point ah they were not\nLet's say indoctrinated with this health far and damnation ...\nI'm a belief system\nThat of course is nothing but fear here is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population and it's still used today right actively unfortunately the control um ... you know society\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be um feared and ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose playing\nYou know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am a mortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and\nForget about tiny problem in life that you feel are so large because our brain may in that way but surely they are insignificant when you compare him to\nHow our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond funny\nYeah yeah and what's\nSo important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that and you know it\nAnd that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama the day you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game that foot here you the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with this era ... news that\nWe have you ever did kill it and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly your work one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'll be no wars are being not know that none of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connect it but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that are going to be connected to [laughter]\nDo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we would All right we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nGreat now that's great thank you so much the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques and William talks about is discovering your talents threw out of body channel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't to say she is with the TV I any type of trauma or brain injury we went to avoid those they they are not time no\nNo and uh unfortunately a lot of people do it so shape the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even though ... ... are part of the near death experience there are also independent of that so it's important a distinction to make\n... interesting and I could have gave in New Jersey how well kind of thing for days how I Am tonight\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right so\nThis is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up a place called west town Pennsylvania we moved there when I was about two and I started getting visitation\nThat would these patients they gave me um I first saw a ... a day a Catholic school\nOr do they have gained vote by has both my days where there's a there's two girls and then ... it happens ... exactly would tea or I saw the night before and good to have it off they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar of\nFascinating very cool so can they be pre content is\nYes it can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have ah let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive that the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at a time it's linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience as quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it ... than non physical reality\nIt's a whole and all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause everything functions in a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in a long it takes you called and I appreciate it and we and can you ask in going into and out of ... ... and ... destiny question or\nHow does he get something out that really going into the future more than\nHe giving out your huh\nYeah that really going into the future more than he giving out your huh\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question has to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there's no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but have you ever ask yeah great\nUm let's see if she did she are well hard line to berry in St Louis I very high you\nHi Lisa thanks for taking my call\nI have a question you your guest um\nYears ago while we were out of town I if I ever really close and he passed subtly while we were out of town and I'm going back and I just didn't let them my last view of him to be in a casket so I didn't go off and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was the least of the time\nAnd that was chasing the suspect for a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held his hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle town it's okay and uh I I wanted to talk to them but he was actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased Elise and he was gone and I walked up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream on that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from beyond you know life after death aroused federal me down because it actually worked\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream logic experience\nUh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high\nAnd often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid\nAbsolutely valid a contact Mm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing yes\n... and then it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right near San there in ... you remember him rather than any casket and I think that's a really wonderful intention and you basically did this technique out ... and I think he's saying that um [noise]\nWhat did we got rewarded for every good decision dinner

allowed\nBlew everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter]\nI Can't wait\nTill the ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise] well she started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat\nAnd I'd be ... to you know\nInnocent but then I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about in life\nSeeing and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old is your nephew epigenetics at this time next and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks\nAnd he was bleeding okay he was leading and it looked like he had been written all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had said this in his hand and I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat\nAnd he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew I'm Sorry he kept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too\nWell it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow is the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful\nHe said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\nAnd and how would you do did you\nMy gosh I was so frightened you just to me even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's silly stew he stole something again you know and\nI might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway it was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several he wins or men knows I'm just going to\nSay that what what we ended up finding out was that it was it the sign up for it all it is it's it's really strongly haunted still I'm ...\nAnd you are still living there no milk no\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level and we took the doorbell about the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of the place where what happened to her\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen [noise]\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post who would buy something like that ah it actually you know what about talk about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard\nIs that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so I Am really I Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work men with ... experts and they\nUh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain you know that really works it apparently it worked because it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating for about a hundred years\nYeah it was tremendously haunted and then later\nAfter you know me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so haunted [noise] and I won't get into that right now I did\nFind out that there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic or horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about you know some people may feel it and not know how\nYou know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a lecture experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to\nEat [laughter] no he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor for like he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he does is friends do ya my step mom's to go to her [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway [laughter]\nWell that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in ... springs right just a little of the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right\nYeah oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak he\nHe was fascinated with manatees springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of vanity springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kinda sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck\nWill go up [laughter] and um you can feel it um and the other thing\nThat's curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just circling\nOver managed to spring it was like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it they he was saying he must speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like\nDiving into buildings and and like ... how the pilots [laughter] interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is fascinating we will find out more about managing Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Stephanie waters I Am the garden listening to coast to coast am\nSo Stephanie town it's a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage it springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack Twain than that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you ride over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the natives actually hurt the town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter]\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago with September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nOld dead body it was awful he's and he was\nNow this for you that body it was awful he's and he was suicide\nCome to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to I'm\nWrong but they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artist dancers singer musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy that if you don't properly can all this energy\nFor the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first\nMoved here and I see it happening to other people was warned them my\nA God son moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful attic apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the\nThe spirit of manager Wilber took him and he goes I can see what I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] and when he got to be careful will he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that interview wherever they live it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can just call it that [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is it goes here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there's no business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and um what do you say that\nYou would have to have a lot of anger to be ... it to be tethered here um if you are full of life and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it\nI don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there you these beings want to see each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled\nI you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by us friendly spirit I'm like give me a great there are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because why would they why would they said that's a good point\nIs it's going it's troubling and and when you lift this okay ... did it it can it can lead you down a dark road\nOkay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into the dark force you know it's nothing to play around\nWith our own goes troubled in our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her crossover by writing this last book and I have that that is a matter of fact\nInvestment forgotten jails have gone on\nBoth legends allure of the Rockies by ship or and it just came out and the very first story is true I\nSwear to God Knows about it [laughter] pardon jealous about it\nOkay about its they've actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted well\nI didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... did not tell this story to anyone

real\nConstantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true now I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse and it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this\nBuilding completely read it because it had to get rid of all this stuff this and that was like three million dollars right there but anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building\nAnd I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do\nLooking [laughter] then at home and I don't\nKnow but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNo right to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do it again yeah we do not [laughter] concept I mean\nThere are certain things to be that for the history tours and things that are being done and you could land ... or ... being built and so forth where the the fine line there to honor in fact the lure of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give there is a legend about managed to springs that you're not allowed to leave and unless you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice you\nMartin summoned to this town\nAnd I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs oh always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of gas and\nStuff like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a boost in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to move to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this would make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days\nOr so that maybe their spirit lingers that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not a ghost [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nUsually own that for a\nSeat I earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college it has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dog's heard it they were howling like going on\nI think that's a residual it's like a group in time you know quantum says this can explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like ... toast you can still smell the burnt so [laughter] it's gone yeah\nI Lived in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this to mention temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we\nMean by no means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense to have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and it ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know other people\nDo [laughter] you have anybody around that you could ask me\nAre in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children\nThat's the nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turn it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of go through thing that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on move\nOn I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to his this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works but would you ask I\nTell it or you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I notice is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to do\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get hot here it's it's really sad if you think about these go centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those timing is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world upon the moon and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest\nAnd when you do have it happen it\nBlows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter]\nPeople have had it happen enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now Trump which do you started this wonderful conventions paranormal convention travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a moot movable fees for like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historian\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it you need to get rid of and he does we're here we're not going to be like those guys though were really like I Would call us paranormal psychologists [laughter]\n... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese so when you do the tour you have a group to come with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there\nAfter Seventeen years there's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tourists do change night by night and you never know which there it is going to come out and\nPlay quite interesting does the ... specific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\n[noise] no I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay there are always\nDifferent they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called cutting as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch it's darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch of\nThose my goodness All right we're going to take a quick break and they were going to come back which listener moon cause any those experiences are questions you have definitely water to calm I mean the guardian listening to cook because I Am\nI think the youth and asking for a resolution and asking for some kind of a sign to come to you and and that is what happened that you manifest at your own acceptance in your own and and love love into your life but it does that make sense\nFascinating yeah wow\nFor

I mean these this is just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body\nYou know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but once you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who have passed and you're doing this face to face\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to discover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey\nAre we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is you know what I did it you can I just interviewed Raymond Moody and like I show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the turn a life after death and\nUm he had\nExpressed to me after Fifteen Years doing\nThat\nHe doesn't know for sure\nYet yeah life have to get because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard in the report people who live here in\nHis life to live the nomination he killed a dozen as a scientist as a load generation right now I Know for sure this\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research\nShaded out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification you can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being and you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development it\nPuts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time and this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our

early teenage years why do you think is going to get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nShut down I think it as an interest just affects us something to do with it every body yeah refocusing\nTheir attention on their um let's just say their biological urges certain mhm but children are I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book about children's out of body experience I have received thousands of letters from\nOver the decades from parents who share their experiences\nWith about their children unfortunately I'm In our society sometimes these or misinterpreted and you know they they end up taking their child to a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there\nOut of the norm around family to deal with so they ended up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever or it's unfortunate because there it's just natural you know we are not\nIt's unfortunate because there it's just natural you know ... or ... you know what's funny is that Ninety over Ninety percent of Americans believe that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being and in other words and if we are as most people believe them why would we be locked into a biological machine for our entire life where when that's not what we are\nWe we have a natural ability to explore beyond their physical limits the Buddhist of known this forever\nThat's why they train young Buddhist boys at a very young age to begin their training and meditation because they're more open to having profound spiritual or multi dimensional experiences when they're young\nRight right and you know\nWe don't receive that we've been trained to be a very materialistic from birth so that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning that most of us have or the\nRight to not mostly focused on the external when we're young somewhere between two to five years older than the he's putting them on the average number amount of money is very important yes\nThey're very young and they continue up to puberty and a lot of them were amazed I have twin boys in my boys both of them would have just profound experiences\nNow it was it was amazing to me what they would do it at night\nYeah it's incredible I had one on now you say it's common even counter under in your experience it can you go back and read in the team had a nightmare you when you go back and you when you\nClose the and create a new ending to it and forget dream technique\nOh absolutely can you do that\nYou can a nightmare is a ... is a reflection of your fear\nAnd during and it's not fair to the technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner you send loved to the fear during the out of body experience\nUm in other words you don't run from it you can from it and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear and you do it fully conscious not just in a dream but imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully\nAbsolutely conscious and you do the same technique where you are literally dissipating or dissolving\nFears are blocked that's the great block for self knowledge is fear right it's it's a great block that all of us can front and one way or another it's\nIt's an invisible box that everybody creates around themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to\nConfront and dissipate and dissolve\nThose fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nAlthough he eighty six percent for me on and you know here you know we're hearing out of money and they had a very peaceful and\nYes according to this survey\nHating\nIt yes it was it was pretty high remember that a lot of the people responding to me also were not um there were open to the experience to some degree I have to acknowledge that that's\nA good point uh they were not let's say indoctrinated with this how far and damnation ...\nI'm a belief system\nThat of course is nothing but fear here is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population a and it still used today actively unfortunately the control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared and ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose playing you know\nThat you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual B\nI you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual bay and that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you and your level of consciousness and forget\nAbout tiny problem in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way but surely they are insignificant when you compare him to how vast our\nOur universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond her body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou're you're you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around your cars you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game that foot here you know the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we\nHadn't ridiculous that's and you realize it's you know there's so much important stuff that we need to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity it's lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke\nOne day and knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars are being not never fessed none of that would occur\n... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that would be connected to [laughter]\nWell we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we don't All right we're going to take another quick break and when we come back we're going to take your\nCalls so feel free to give us a call and I only think I can listen ... damn [noise]\nWelcome back to ... am Ryan Lee cigar and my guess William ... is joining me his website again is astral info dot org now uh we have great college can ... sure and tactic let's go to\nJamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jamie when is your question\nHuh how's it going great what is your question my friend\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nThe question the question I mean not remembering the experience or memory loss and general\n... coalition a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself\nBut not interfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall of certain things that you use all the time so to speak like worth and stuff like that and drive in things like that\nOh I Would definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and Tom\nIssues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques it doesn't serve their brain memory patterns that All right\nI've not seen any correlation for that I\nUm I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert my road did and others that have written many books um\nOthers set of written many books I'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever seen since Jamie an added ...\n... ... in them than\nI can relate to the Louis Vuitton woman trying to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah ... ... myself poll whatnot with more functional so\nGreat that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's one of the techniques and William talks about in covering your town too out of body channel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't associated with the TV I any type of drama or\nA brain injury we want to avoid those they they're not saying no no\nAh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... um and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese are an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even obese are part of the near death experience there are also independent of that so it's important a distinction to make\n... interesting um I just couldn't get the New Jersey ... or ... Elena night\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right so\nThis is where it might get a little weird when I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called ... town Pennsylvania we move there when I was about to when I started getting visitation\nThat would this visit patients they gave me um I first saw a ... a day a Catholic school\nOr I fell down the scapegoats my hands both days where there's a there's two girls and their mouths were charged it happened ... would tea or I saw the night before and good to have it off they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you liar of\nFascinating is very cool so can they be pecan in his room\nYes they can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of people that have a let's just say knowledge of events\nAre not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as the future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time as we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize\nThat for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it then non physical reality it's a whole and all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical 'cause it everything functions and a little different than it does here [noise]\nUh and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in along it makes you called me and my ... and ... and can you ask in going into and out of money sitting and media destiny question or\nHow to figure something out that really going into the future more than\nHe can bring out your\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question as to get the universe is willing to provide the answers\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that\nIt wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nAnd there's no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but you have to ask yeah that's great I mean she did she are a wildcard line to berry in St Louis Hi Mary how are you\nSo while we were out of town like that and I have a really close to the past ... or we were out of town and um we ... them I just didn't let my last few him to be in a casket so I didn't go off and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was back at least about the time\nAnd I was chasing the suspect for ... or ... a mall very familiar with but when I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing who right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held his hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle town it's okay and uh I I wanted to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased to lease and he was gone and I woke up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from beyond you know life after death row house settled down because it actually works\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high ...\nAnd often will perceive it in a dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid absolutely\nValid or contact Mm uh\nI Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact\nAnd that kind of regard with a loved one\nHe'd sound very healing yes\nIt ... it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right

true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well what is the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nI had somebody tried to remove the curse and it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this\nBuilding completely read it because it had to get rid of all this ... this and that was like three million dollars right there but anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building and I actually read the article in the Colorado Springs does that\nAnd it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do\nLooking [laughter] and then at home and I don't\nKnow but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNo right to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do that again yeah not when it comes I mean there are\nCertain things should be done for the history tours and things that are being done in secret lan ... or ... being built and so forth we urge to this fine line there to honor in fact the lure of that particular lane\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that be to the land that be and I give there is a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave and unless you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou mark summoned to this town and I know that sounds\nCrazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I say so what brought you to manage to springs\nHallways the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh and stories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to those types of energy or maybe you have a ... in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to do to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies\n[noise] now I I Want to cut out this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe their spirit linger it's that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not a ghost\n[laughter] um other day right\nUp but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move\n[laughter] usually own that for a seat I earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that\nI Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the veil is so thin this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years I've never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dog's heard it they weren't howling like going on I think that's a residual it's like a group in time you know quantum says this can explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the burnt\nSo [laughter] it's fun yeah\nI live in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we\nMean by that means it was just like I heard it in the room like\nSome it was a burping time does that make sense I didn't have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah so\nYeah when I hear so I don't know other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask a much\nIn tune with the higher laws of nature as I say delicately they can they can pick up on it too had children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to see\nIt's a much but the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of what you're saying that they're not usually wanting to say they want to move on or they should leave on\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but I mean do that how would you suggest or how would you cheat someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it or you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these those centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen\nIt blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw see that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they dropped me on the head when I was a\nBaby imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] other people have had it\nHappen enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now ... which do you started this wonderful convention this turnover convention travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a moot movable fees for like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contacted the local historians\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it you need to get rid of and he does we're here we're not going to be like those guys though were really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist\n[laughter] there's such a jerk and yes and that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group to come with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my towards um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that\nI don't have a meeting site because before my tours I actually do a prayer and meditation and ask for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tourists do change night by night and you never know which spirit is going to come out and play quite interesting\nThose that use AOL specific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\n[noise] no I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay\nThere are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called spending as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch

opening expansive experiences mhm\nSo it's not limited to just out of body experiences a for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nInto a open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nKnow what the question could you know and then you write them down when you come out and then I write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets the journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise\nYou begin to journal whatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive\nAnd they are waking to their their true self and the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication then grow into the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then I mean in a way your experience you William how he died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my friend since then again on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered souls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means ... assistance\nOr that but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have\nDied um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance I think that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and I'm\nAt ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and\nTo that shift say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMm mhm so the two and system and crossing over have you ever done this after a tragic incident and national tragic incident were masked is still you know one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time\nUm that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way I imagine you're having coffee one morning and your office and suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean\nCan you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those um people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions and different names and different cultures\nBut then I went to ... we we presented in\nThink I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least a scientific as we can ... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable\nWith no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great it really allowed to have their own experience in that I went to find out a little bit more on how\nOne of the culture or does this and what it's called ... and other cultures are going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about what are their culture just exist than an ounce and a little bit more on how you can you didn't on your own on and live with that with my guest William moment I Am in arguments any ... and\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more checks path to seven nine six four or five that's P.
