or whatever and they pay any attention to those in between ... states of consciousness between sleep in the wake\nThat's a good time to catch it means good time to back on the loose of dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... says losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dreams because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes they kiss goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams that giving us a little ring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot manifest because but not young enough but not rich and not whenever I find the right to do the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these out some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the simple suggestions that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with you might have a fragment and if you\nAbout nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWell then you can dream wide awake ... will speak the language of signs and symbols and things but it's if you pay attention and sometimes you get more look\nTo the pop up to like pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream clone the night as well\nSome incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh rubbish why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through to you try to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I a lot of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in\nOrder to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream produce that might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same but this is not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not older people did one box\nWe do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe it very strange women who sat down next to me in a plane and old reality and mentioned me at a certain point that a dead house than to the ... he was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn knees creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams\nThat I'm doing the music and the special effects I think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed at night you the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you've become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself\nMaybe if you're a high a self made people cite the wise or inside the highest ...\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd it's probably being run by someone with a slightly why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock us awake into doing some course correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robertson a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current understanding by kinda understanding I mean the really ready to revive was quite interesting understanding about dreams that dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with it and ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discovered that we have snow doorway into this whole quantum information field and depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information my getting we can bring through more and\nI mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical you can do dream in basements means Youssef is an intention to get guidance on anything that interest you and probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of ... narratives affirm the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything and the history of credit breakthroughs in science mhm allergy in the aughts\nEven in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it\nIt can take us into the off the lights that you see the hand what the job opportunities some living environment a like\nA bee on death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the mentality of adventure killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your\nDreams\nWhere we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I worked with the the dreams show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dream shows\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead their husbands the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life that can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know for certain show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheel that coming down\nThe hill to file on the other side of a\nBlind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel all the time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact you understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of many a time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we're leading a power life this comes very interesting when you begin to look at give some lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at other parallel life\nI think it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives of situations that people in

to coast to coast Robert Moss with us his latest work is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the effect of the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books out on a show that that\nThat's still pretty prolific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams is an\nAbsolutely\nIt's amazing what you can do a dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and you just listed some really interesting areas for example in terms of a help\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams of their body talk as well as so to speak and other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center the idea is that a dream like gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show it's symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms so that's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help is to get wild him to stay relevant and it's worth acting up on those dreams and try and bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were United telepathy which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt it's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's the phenomena of shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures\nFriends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up to your dreams remember more than a look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and his being cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal they're not supernatural but at the um the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition until after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to see things the distance\nTo connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that fewer growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things green tool to live with them if you can't find a solution to a problem or relied put the question to your dreams and see what comes\nAnd I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes it's what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence gold is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in those amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver said incidents are finding\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street or go to the talk of going your morning commute but that question in your mind and received the first time usually unexpected thing that enters your field of deception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing\nHow specifically the world will speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and the and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him a mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tapes and I've got something for you to come on down it works doesn't it\nYes wow you're send to Europe be met and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental to leg graffiti back in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with and not mailing it he just ... on and on that person a notice what followed the news said that actually almost didn't celebrate that was the response so you're practicing a game\nThat is an age all day and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already things that are already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached a menu of reaching a nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be open to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical to deliver the is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then for some reason they pick it up\nSuch as in there and then you for some reason they pick it up yeah yeah\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments of microbes by which one of those degrees the bell send him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor it's a non announced image to the group and people have to guess in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMight be and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people about ascend to another ... this is just a focused example of something that we do automatically connected with each other where ... where in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on and on dreams overtime\nRobert you've talked about synchronous you explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this way make I dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go\nBeyond the cook ... or re I'm standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deeper space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including that of powder than our ancestors\nThrough synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence is to live on the other side of those cook in the walls of old really understanding come pushing old poking or tickling to bring us a weight to give us a message of some kind\nOf this is the thing about synchronous demeaning folk ... that you gave us would sit in front of the cause is set up without trouble in Tokyo about co incidents they gave us a different would in some kind of state we often feel there's a hidden happy if your getting awaiting cannot handshake or pushback\nFrom something beyond our kitten something we cannot see so although the phenomena this cold isn't\nA causal phenomenon them and said since there's no obvious happening cause and effect we often feel there is causation that play you might even feel that very large forces are in play poses the forces of human called the archetype so that people might have called the ... through the God's will the ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shapes every day of my life the paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like it's not just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that\nBut you might notice that there's a ... enough connection as you go through the day is sit in the ... comes up again and again a sudden symbol comes up again and again and you notice when that is happening as the recurring dream hey\nSlowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this what is the unit those telling you that you need to rectify\nRobert

yeah\nHey let's all celebrate the love of radio this holiday season in one of the greatest ways to do it is to treat yourself to a new radio or somebody you hear about from sea crane what I Need a radio with the best reception an audio that's who I turn to she crane because they're always there for you they know radio they continue to make good products\nBecause she ... loves radio to the CBC Radio too we is the best damage from radio and with the two week you can hear our show for example with amazing clarity the CBC Radio too we is designed to receive long range aim of FM reception and make those weak signals stronger\nThe high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted as well you get great voice clarity even even for music it's really something supporting the troops radio that has the ability to bring in those stations crystal clear and you get that put the CBC Radio to eat from she crank\nAnd I realize that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away\nUm I Know that I'm going to get hit with\nEither a missile or something like ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this\nIt's something like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so I kind of a stronger and we kinda reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think that many damn\nWell it's possible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest ... sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on the tea yet and hopefully you weren't\nAbout it's perfectly possible that you had long range pretty cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nThat the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a literal meeting but the symbolic mean I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the ... and seeing this may be this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic is something that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional for the\nMost ... something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me preparing me for an emotional situation which are not all that full situation which I Need to be ready I don't know but that comes to my mind the upside down cell phone you know I just want ... holding that image I realized that might be something larger more scary than a cell phone\nBut I sort of water reach into that dream and grab that sells they let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end\nI mean this is the way that I Am about treats I'm probably one of the like the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years that he has since the dream\nI sort of want to reach into the dream ... cell phone or hold it to my ear and say who is that talked to me while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death\nIn our dreams where often people are often talking to the dead on phones are receiving phone calls from them I sort of want to go nuts direction with that tree\nRobert wiring dream sometimes convoluted and mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream so the dream sources of many sources of ... and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily is not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nFind the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the ... take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick you determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get when you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream\nI I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing the something about living our whole life\nYeah play implicitly in your dreams I mean once we understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream and a few minutes to talk time they can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back from the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond office memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nOne is more prevalent than looser dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nA lot of people ah don't seem yet to understand how to come loose a dream is the idea of elusive dream of becoming very popular in that movie inception and and the ideas how to you couldn't make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said that you know sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe the fat loose of dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it for themselves when they try and memorize ways of wake you up to ... inside of dream but could you and see if you can stick a thing go through your um that kind of stuff\nI said earlier the easiest way to the ... dream is to start up loose that stay that way so I didn't know how common listed dreaming is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having pretty talkative dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not scout\nAhead of the cells some aspect of consciousness checks out what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dream span a whole spectrum there are big dreams are little dreams a little dreams that I'd rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams which you feel that you have received a message from those you might feel yourself in the presence of the highest source of wisdom all you've gone travelling you know you've gone to a distant galaxy or different time period or a place with a dead or alive so\nThere were different time period or a place with a dead or alive so the point is that all of these avenues of knowledge an adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to remember more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that's basic

don't know but I Do know I mean I didn't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes\nI don't know whether the shapes shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central it's\nPhysically impossible for those people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible an early

question would be a I'm noticing some trains\nThat seemed to have a scene with moving parts square that this moving parts\nAnd what kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio is trying to find his way out of the ship that oil is moving parts and he still has that theme of he still wants to stay with us girlfriend in the movie uh yeah you know we still have felt about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on shopping and I noticed\nA couple of times like block shots that word near the top of the back yard so I had to be shopping high\nHurting good jumping ... yeah [laughter]\nAnd this was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know is basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of assess\nSo I keep having the scream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of basketball so what's\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something you did a lot\nYet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a drink to that it's OK maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song or or and walk and springing up another type of a second you know\nVery interesting ... I mean I'm thinking if I if I Am a boomer player I I'm not doing at this stage in my life but here I Am jumping at high and so I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jump jump in life of a different kind where is the next tide jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity\nMight be a new form of understanding where am I going to be a slam dunk in another field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy between my ... my great prowess on on the basketball court\nWith these jumps at the junk that it lies ahead\nThe the the moving parts and the Titanic and now that is interesting is not a lot to go on but if I if the moving parts make me think of that you know emotional scene from the movie\nI might wonder again where in my life my being prepared by history to move on in some sense\nAnd I can't think about the Titanic without recalling that there was a great British researcher a psychic phenomena and the paranormal go W T stand here the famous germ listed the day we went down on the Titanic Twenty years before he went down on the Titanic\nHe wrote a story about the record the supposedly unsinkable lineup cold the majestic NO NAME of the captain of the vote in his story was the name of the captain on the Titanic\nSo they're from the history of the Titanic we have an account\nA long range pre cognition as embodied the story Rob and simply a dream of poet I must add that stood up to death dictator or central dictated or a marketable account of life on the other side of death\nCalled the blue island so the Titanic association said also to pop moving in my mind that thank you for that\nYou know how do you explain things like Leonardo da Vinci came up with I mean he was a genius ... almost like a time travel I wouldn't do that in a dream state you think\nYou you feel that in relation to certain kinds of mind I mean she was often said that you can't explain Tesla the original Tesla except as a time travel you do feel that great minds are able to draw upon intelligence and understanding from more than the cover of reality they are in a sense\nAble to reach two other mines the poet you ate the Irish poet rebates who's the theme of another my stories and mysterious realities\nHe spoke about the mingling of mine and what he was saying is if you're knocked on the ... study or inquiry or creative breakthrough you will attract the intelligence the intelligence and the the the the the support\nOver there my name is Laurie Ann yes I Do suffer\nFrom post national ... okay\nDon't suffer in silence contact wounded warrior project dot org\nFlu season is here the flu shot is the first and best protection against tracking the flu so take a positive step and help reduce your chances of catching the seasonal flu and get a flu shot the cost of a flu shot is often covered by your health plan checking\n[noise] every day [noise] men and women in the United States Marine corps\nBe American way of life [noise]\nMy name is Joe Thompson I'm twenty nine and thanks to my college degree I'm a systems analyst and the college me would tell you\nI wouldn't be here without big brothers big sisters my big brother believed in me and to a seven year old that means that la\nNina sending you got to be anything\nWhether you donate money or time you're helping big brothers big sisters help a child starts something today it big brothers big sisters dot org brought to you by big brothers big sisters in the ad council\nPresident says it snaps humanitarian aid it's political ...

building because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that's where my website where um what happened\nI I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and tell us to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through had created a portal\nIn my building and in my apartment and the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park so that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Jewish\nWe saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people were just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if it was just something that just happened but write them down record your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record with your experience thing and it will really happen that way and open up more effect that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about uh\nOne of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLovely yeah sure absolutely\nOK George thank you I had never heard of ... but I had an allergy about maybe four years ago I had this out of body experience where I did ask to travel which I had really no memory of doing ever before I think we all travel and we just forget or don't we don't know

born on Tuesday says named Tuesday lob sang and ... and if you go to his website it's a lot of saying ramp a dot org\nBut he came to get me and I went on this phenomenal trip\nTo his own mystery and

out he took a new body on and he was living as an Englishman in his final incarnation on the earth and Nineteen eighties\nSo I was at Islam is Terry and it was phenomenal and I came back and to my body brought me back and as I was waking up\nHe said to me don't forget my name and I had never heard I couldn't remember it but my husband was there and I said jak before I wake up please write this down and\nI spelled it out ... and I misspelled it slightly put an H on it or it didn't belong and then he was a lot of things done but I went to his website and I was blown away because he has written\nMaybe a couple of hundred books that are free anyone go to volition\nYeah extremely cell and just really an amazing amazing man and not only was he a doctor but he was also just so many different incarnations it makes you realize that we don't really have to die I think two main also was walking and George do you believe that that's possible you could take on\nA further uh

don't think I had much of a choice because my cousin George realized my sister and I are in trouble Camry pulled us both out and kind of\nAn ceremony furniture with on the beach and that was back in my body\nBut I wanted to tell you that it was a glorious experience and I've had many that was really one of the first\nAnd uh I learned a lot from that I learned not to let my son to teach me how to swim for one thing that's a problem in the mail message from that\nExactly it's a scary thing I got to tell you the same thing happened to me when I was a kid except I didn't have an ... experience I was with my father's brother my uncle was the twins and we're walking in a lake\nAnd ah I'm side by side next to my uncle and uh I get a whole in this lake in just like you down I went I must have been about eight years old George\nAnd I'm gone I and I thought this is it I'm dead [laughter] and now we're back something beyond me\nBack up my pop right back up and then my uncle didn't even know I went under just kept walking but it was the weirdest newly but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nCorrect I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times Oh thank you I was at the world Trade Center\nWhen nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from from the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings came down gosh\nYeah I mean is there a month and on the day we moved and Jack and I looked up and the world Trade Center was towering over our little building on liberty court and ah I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building because it was unsafe to be there for many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most phenomenal experience and that to my website where um\nWhat happened I I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and told to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through had created a portal\nIn my building and in my apartment and people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty and that was Battery Park so that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had with thousands of people said they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still love that area Joyce\nNo we saw that apartment when my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida\nBut uh just like so many incredible things that people were just try to remember some of the things that happen to them I think most people say well if it was just you know something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guest has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to develop your yes pay is to try to remember and to try to record what you're experiencing and what really happened that way and open up more of that that consciousness you'll be able to help other people as well\nSo that's that's my primary recommendation record your dream to record your experiences I had a I don't know if I should if you're ready for me to tell you another one of a one my phenomenal experiences about a\nLovely yeah sure absolutely okay truck thank you I had never heard of ... but I had an odd about\nFour years ago I had this

let ourselves the rushed out sleep by the alarm clock but then he kept job of deal with the family we think that we should lie in this in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between ... states of consciousness between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to embark on loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close our power dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so he'd slam the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes they kiss goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams are giving us a little ring pictures of possibility that we cannot none of us because we're not young enough but not rich enough we'll never find the right school or the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream\nBecause we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these out some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the the simple suggestions that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then the you can dream wide awake world around she will speak the language of signs and symbols and things but as you could pay attention and sometimes you get more look\nTo the pop up to like pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nSome incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that well\nIt's a recurring dream is coming again and again and those are hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor from England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nOh rubbish why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation and trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on they've tried to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I might of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie\nCompany that is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked\nHow I'll dream produces might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same time it's just not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams of not older people did one box\nWe do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories and mysterious reality as I describe it very strange woman who sat down next to me and the plain ordinary reality and mentioned me at a certain point that a dead husband or the ... he was a ... musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn the knees creepy story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects\nI think back to that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be due the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you've become conscious it might be some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself\nMaybe if you're a high up so maybe a site there why is there and fight the highest ...\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this\nI think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you and it's probably being run by someone with a slightly why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShocked us awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful\nBoy noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no way in which you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and parents physics or meet up I mean the our current understanding by car to understanding I mean the really ready to revive of writing and understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells us science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information\nThat contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it according to our ability to have this information and do something with it in ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the Post's no doorway into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example it'd be very simple about this very simple practical you can do treatment ... means you set an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you in probably something will come through if you don't think you've got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose the dream on that subject as well because you've got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they come through across history a lot of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of store narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything and the history of credit breakthroughs in science\nKnowledge in the aughts even in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory positive\nIt can take us into the off the lights that you see the hand walked the job opportunities some living environment like\nA bee on death so you can talk to their ancestors beloved loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the ... of adventure killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away is this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dream shows\nOpportunities and challenges that lie ahead there with us as the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life that can save your job they can say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today if I did not know for certain show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death ... road accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheel that coming down the hill to file on the other side of a blind spot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one\nDirection and in fact you understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of the NEA time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place\nFrom which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times when you're leading a power live this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not at other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nOf the guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in far flung places to a part of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nThat we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in times of the ... point\nOf view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I and I'm not doing

mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the twenty fifth publish the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous 'cause I Dreamed some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to publish sixty eight books\n[laughter] a short of that that's still pretty\nProlific though good for you good for you and the ... they're all fascinating works\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do a dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and your list and some really interesting areas for example in terms of our hope\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams of their body talk as well as sold tool in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center the idea is that a dream like gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms so that's one of the functions of ... and ... and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay well and and it was acting up on those dreams and trying to bring their energy true you mentioned connecting with other people were United telepathy which look pretty mean fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more than a look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal but not supernatural but that'd be on the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen right but see things at a distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that fewer\nGrowing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solution for things dreams will deliver them if you can't find a solution to a problem the oatmeal I\nPut the question to your dreams and see what come\nAnd I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes is what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the fence of old is is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the main thing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind I'm suddenly the will deliver that incident or citing\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes\nA way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is put your question to the world go down the street or go to the park could go and your morning commute without question in your mind and received the first time usually unexpected thing that enters your field deception\nAs a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically but we'll we'll speak to you delivering a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and the and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape and heard from him\nA mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tape and I've got something for you to come on down it works doesn't it\nYes wow you're sending your ... your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental to leg graffiti back in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with and not mailing it he just ... on\nThat I'm that person unnoticed walk followed the news that that actually almost didn't celebrate that was a response so you're practicing a game that is an age all day\nThat was a response so you're practicing a game that is an angel game and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached I mean you are reaching out but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be able to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical to deliver the is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then just for some reason they pick it up yeah yeah\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments of microbes by which one of those degrees about sending him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor Saddam announced image to the group and people have to guess in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy to beat and it's interesting how that works and some people are very good at picking up and some people a better send those so now the businesses just focused example of something that we do automatically connected with each other where ... where in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on in ... all the time\nRobert you've talked about synchronous and explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this make I dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the cook will develop or re I'm standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deep space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including the\nDeposit and our ancestors through synchronous today we often feel the forces and intelligence to live on the other side of those cooking the walls of Audrey understanding come pushing up poking oh tickling to bring us a way to give us a message to some time\nThis is the thing about ... ... that you gave us would sit in front and see 'cause it's set up without trouble in Tokyo about co incidents they gave

forces are in play poses the forces that you're called the archetype so that people might have called the spirits of the guard so the ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shaped every day of my life the paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like not just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that\nBut you might notice that there's a pack enough connection as you go through the day is sit in the ... comes up again and again a sudden symbol comes up again and again and you notice when that is happening as with a recurring dream hey\nSlowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this what is the universe telling you that you need to rectify\nRobert since you've been doing this have we got the answer on why it works or how it works because we do agree that it does work what how yes\nIt it the the law of attraction has been oversimplified mistakes that by the by the new age but the law of attraction it's always in play the law of attraction means that we tracked over pill events or encounters according to the

Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all things\nWhat's the issue\nWhat does it mean to the polls is better than the crash I Believe are behind this march\nAnd I think it all you're talking hatch should find out who's paying for their ... who's ... treat him coming north and you're going to find out ... and the publisher and total change\nMhm you're talking about the ... which we are going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an ecosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan individuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only that carbon but more\nI I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a Catholic migration refugee services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states\nOf course they get hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers have emptied so they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals' it's families because they know that's their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you\nAnd they can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names are releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out will also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for Ingram we're right back stay there\n[noise]\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nThe book will start anew as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than ... million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nOr whether it be you know a Tom said something you know saluted the guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting of journalists to ribbon\nYou're on on that the emotional play\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might that be effective given the difficult tense out there\nWell I think it might ... in my view the Democrats have no agenda I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue [noise]\nUh and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey I think too\nYou know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon dish and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is or what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great\nAgenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do more than their creditors it's the only I was thinking that I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and uh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think\nDemocrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like ... [laughter] I'm sure didn't help [laughter]\n\nBut now you've variation as far as I can say anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that got to get the Boulder report\nW looking into alleged\nYou know alleged obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballot and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... and I want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to ... three games a NATO Rourke um\nWho is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed a crime that tree than primary primary or a high crime and the demeanor which one of those you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in an impeachment to an indictment there there was enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that pack does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the done it\nStill didn't hear the charge\nYou exactly he a dodge that\nDoes that help it doesn't help that are over ... and ah and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down with six million in the bank thing but I you know no I don't take it helps them I think\nWhat federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and Eighteen ...\nYeah well aside from heights and there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that trap you you'll find a lot about it I don't know what I'm going to put him in a corner you and put you on the record year do you think the Republicans\nHold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory of the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nAh they've got to lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations all the rest but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm have you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch\nOK you take it easy Randy thank you fat\nAnd er into all of you listening what is driving you to the polls this November are you is is there an issue it was no one idea\nThat you could not lose and you felt you had to do move on um I keep hearing it was cabinet others say they're concerned about the border still others say this mob mentality or you know we're going to play you a little bit\nYou know what the president said during that rally last night what the challenge really is stay right there\nAnd during that rally last night what the challenge really is stay right there eight five five forty Laura we'll get to all of your coals Raymond
