California how ya doing I tried twice I'm doing fine thank you I tried twice to call the Associated Press ... well actually I tried more than that but I got through twice oh you did yeah and what happened to that just keeps ringing and rain rain\nAn operator comes on the earth and the parties have doubt if not answering his high tech the number and I call it again and it did the same thing\nIt is it is indeed an accurate number now before I gave it out I'm a ... or ... whatever time it was a in the break I called it and I taught I made sure it was the right number I said is this the main associated Washington DC I'm Associated Press office and they said yes it is\nBut I think they've realized something cooking because to me about\nTwenty phone call before I got through the first time you're added on how many of the second time they've probably rake the phones up so people might want to give it a rest for a while and then\nHopefully rake the phones up so people might want to give it a rest for a while and then try back a little later we'll\nKeep trying all by all means and then a call during the day as well um\nLet me just ask you to summarize how you felt about what you heard from Roddy\nWell I ever than uh I heard about the gun that was put together the old peacemaker you know I don't know I had a funny feeling about it um you know apart gun if you're going to commit suicide wouldn't you want to do something that with\nThat you knew was going to do their job I mean I hear the gun with really pretty shy\nBut I mean this is a a bombshell I don't doubt doubt if there's a suit supposed a suicide note or note either way you look at it want to call a suicide noted on if it's a forgery and the best say it is then the whole thing is going to come apart\nOh I Would have to agree with you in fact I Would say probably the only quit and no I wouldn't even call it an anti Clinton story\nIt's not like the most incriminating think the White House that I've ever heard come about\nLook I I Want everybody to know my attitude I I Am not fond of this president but I don't see them on the air\nI have on occasion whereas I'm here to you\nBut damn it look look here we're talking about something more serious and and I'd be doing the same thing if this was George Bush or even Ronald Reagan I don't I don't give a damn who's in office this is past politics we're talking about crime\nYeah this is way this is worth politics and I think we've ever had in this country and if it really if they prove him really to be involved and then after that it would really be a black guy to the\nTo the trust we have in that office it will really\nWell it's got to block it already it'll be a black awry yeah and you know for the sake of our country I tell you are the people and the government are moving away from each other about as fast as the militias in the government are moving toward each other and if we don't start\nTelling the truth and pursuing the truth as a nation we're that's it baby\nYeah we've got to come out and say if you know the press is well it's going to have to say well hey we might not like it that this is how it is not to report it that's going to have to happen\nThere was a day in America Sarah when that's the way the press was\nWell maybe someday it will be again but right now I don't think it is anymore by the way are you serving that I'm calling from California yes let's say a prayer doesn't fall into the ocean\nOnly twenty nine and I'd like to live to be at least as old as you are\n[laughter] well I like to be older than I Am now yeah and that would be nice you know there there is some indication that should be on the phone you go why southern Nevada might go in with it so you know I I could be down there with you\nWell hopefully uh if the first part of California go all the path we're on the freeway to New Mexico\nYou know what bothered me more than anything else well letter I got yesterday saying the good Michael ... is not selling anything more than one year additions to earth changes report\nWell or did you not hear that\nI didn't hear that I'm a regular listener to your show and\nThen you hear it now according to Gordon Michael's gallon he feels it would be dishonest to sell multiple year subscriptions\n[laughter] perhaps [laughter] [noise] well\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and sale you know as Nixon did nobody ... nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that\nAnd I know they're not quite the\nI Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but ... you know we as I'm pleasantly surprised is tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nUm do we are we still the country we once were do we still pursue the truth\nOr do we not care anymore and I guess we'll find out by finding out how many people call up the Associated Press patch area code too old to seven seven six\nNinety four hundred and demand they give this the tension the attention it deserves that's all\nUs at ... area code too old to seven seven six Ninety four hundred and demand they give this the tension the attention it deserves\nThat's all that's all anybody is asking right now you're done a good job or thanks for the call and other words Eric ... you've got a\nForensic experts world class stating unequivocal believe that this is a forgery the note was a forgery now your mind does not have to do a lot of work\n\nOr to see where where would lead from there and it's not a good place I said in a minute ago nobody in their right mind wants to see another presidency fail and I'm not even saying that would occur\nBut you could imagine it would be close or their gets horrible from I Lived through Watergate I remember it I was politically aware during Watergate it was awful\nIt was um actually it was the breaking of the virginity of the American people\nAre innocence was lost of peace out of Chernobyl wrenching piece at a time how's that whole thing began to unravel um it was the beginning of the end of the way America was\n\nAnd nobody wants to see that happen again but the alternative\nIs absolutely horrendous the alternative is in America where it may be possible for the government to manipulate the media\nWhere it may be possible for the government to commit crimes or persons within the government to actually commit crimes\nAnd with their power and influence get away with it now below seven time\nSo Americans really have to make a decision themselves\nAnd\nThis is this is one of those times folks east of the Rockies you're on the air hello hello goodbye [noise] wild card line you are on the air good morning\nOr Carly liberal in California do you listen to that Charlie yeah well yes or no huh did you

I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't really say that but I worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely cracked this case\nUm is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't book for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would have had to cancel out a little bit of torture [laughter] people want to we have to be going well over here [noise] ah [noise]\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last the last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] well I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the Boston Straggler along with hundreds of other crime cases in a book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or what I did um\n[noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an interest in boxing Straggler case and publish some theories about which may be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I ... I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in as well but the men's on the train is a story it just it just speaks to something I I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once uh and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story too\nOld to be told\n'em when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said what was best is it's actually you is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true for all the time that there will be of somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey write their their trip while they're there for people who were actually lovely executed for crimes that may have been convicted by the man trying to them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed nonetheless\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob who are when I was for crimes that were almost certain my committed by right from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that was ... although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say to him\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index of the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nOf was murdered along with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and\n... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off of the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them um but ... and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible we haven't we assumed that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those er which there were enough signature\nA sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's uh\nThat uh we just did not have enough information about it but that's that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my parents' scratching because I'm writing down\n[laughter] when that guy murdered a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually signed up this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway\nSo how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and buckets right there is a hundred percent bucket that his crimes were certainly yeah\nSeventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and that ... percent bucket right and then where total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiply them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome terms of the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders per which he would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent\nI'm usually say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims his guy because that's right All right so you get tickets to a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this is this could be a long answer I'm not a long awaited person those could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often of family including how young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies\nThey live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department [noise] they live near the intersection of two railroad tracks the I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an axe\nThe ax is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they actually there's a ban them at the scene of the crime the handle is washed her finger perhaps\nThe house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law the or or\nSomething is jammed in the door [noise]\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we're the heartbreak at the bottom of the\nReally it was triggered or up to that because I was gonna run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThem several years ago there was like a little bit more of the ... what's that I sort of like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they ah the crime you normally hurt on Sunday night so you heard on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was barking or\nAre the primary understood as was logging the or doors or doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's oh there are clear deer graphic pattern and the murders if want occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland\nOr so that that would be a link between them the uh\n[noise] uh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house term they wear way down low surges gave out a little bit of light [noise] take the feminine a awful laugh and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lap around with him if he committed murders and the other thing is that he would put poet blankets over the head of a free in person or a half a second before you had with Iraq are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from\nFlying back are heading heading him as he was ordering someone\nFlying back and hitting hitting him as he was ordering someone who you are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA ... and that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely couldn't couldn't followed them ... another\nThing I forgot to mention there are all in warm weather with one one possible exception and there's one crime that he very may have ... whether his first crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through a cold weather and after that he'd never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious crown\n... yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that it in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is killing gone in secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known\nAnd are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nWorst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than this this person but uh I I ... I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just kept document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody [noise]\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they could they could have done these things using\nDrifters or people without hope much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims right or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so but the demands on the train is is he is he's called\n... and we have to call them that although we get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to because I don't want to ruin so close to finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but\nThen there's a couple of good football games [laughter] I got distracted dinner so the ... but\nThis guy he nobody it it it would be president does him for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a whole new train tracks because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight and wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInformation of this tight have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve and a national wire services were were organized a story that was private in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is Pam and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even wham logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nThere is no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't\nThe first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing of police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national uh investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces is also one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime per hour long time I'm [laughter]\nI thought I was probably knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective are judicial system\nWas just a hundred years ago ... it's beyond belief how\n... the the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of these crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it\nBut if you committed a crime in a small town that had no police force\nFirst of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the the ... yeah and this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicions of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this little bit in in the uh in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is ... it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI effect Minnick spending\nThe forensic to be presented to the news on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they ... they they were resistant to it\nCinderella is dream comes true because the glass slipper ...\nIn our world so right same can be just as important especially when it comes to car seats always choose the car seat that the right thing for your child's age and size to make sure your little pumpkin get their seats league every time\nSee some more information secret conduct slash the rights to just been brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the council\nWe try to hide our troops to better mental and substance use disorder is from the world [noise] and sometimes for myself scene I'm fine this is a sign\nLike facing a problem we probably\nOnly on how to speak our truth\nJoined the voices from it calmly\nWere confidential information on mental in substance use disorders including prevention and treatment referral code one hundred six six to help raunchy by the U.S department of health and Human Services\nRockets out on all four officers arrive on a rocket guys directly it off\nThe chilling sounds of a synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh I'm Del Walters Fox News police releasing the radio calls in the moments of the massacre\n[laughter]\nWe were working on out here right now the last time they fired off [noise]\nFind fired officer\nWhen the shooting stopped eleven people inside the synagogue were dead six wound it\nCan't happen during a baby naming ceremony a gunman reportedly shouting all Jews must die before opening fire at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood\nIt's forty six year old Robert Ballard is President Trump says he should face the death penalty ...

totally forgotten\nYeah [laughter] then I think that brings us very effectively ...\nIowa I'm ended the new crime story which as you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the railway tickets tickets through what happened in ...\n[noise] an an item of Jim nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um\nA dispute between the ... city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out of it and the town was in complete darkness as this Sunday night there was a church service\nOr a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims of the woman who was the head of the house after the\n... after the ... I didn't get into this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe the voice of murders would ... would\nEver have happened when they did have the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have\nA had another outrage that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up anyway ... um\nUh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More\nI went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and the little girls spent the night with a better friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June ten ... around in the house the a and the uh uh his brother finally comes that breaks into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the pound Marshall and he\nIs the name of a Hank Horton Mr Horton courageously goes through the house you have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here or there is a dark house\nA is holding matches in front of him or with ... had to know former protection holding matches in front of a front of his\nOwn himself going from room to room finding bodies their ... their bodies in the house and like it my log house in a small quiet Midwestern town\nThe um [noise] uh and all of them have had with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl the from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an attitude suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged\nAfter that they um [noise] uh in any case the crime was not there was a great uproar as you can imagine what the crime was not solved\nA two years later a con man named Jay and walk or some came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he could keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local set of them Frank Jones of finance through the crimes\nThere isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones divided bulldoze a\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became a cable badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop if their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nThat this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a Walker San jose eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it\nPersisted in the city I Would I Would say for two extent that they persist to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the pushing the whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it and even that creates a pattern\nFor all too often how um crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated yet yeah it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working the the crimes bill\nThe crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing or somebody knowing somebody but it wasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how he just by keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end of these and then it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again did that sense of outrage\nAbout what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also teach kind of the idea of the murder alive\nIt it makes it it gives you a sensation again that is you know the core sensationalism but it does it makes it really make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happen had they had they built a you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try\nTo come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town\nWith the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town or afterwards\nThe um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone built a memorial to them\n[noise] I I'm for many years the bullets or\nAuthority that I Would say that still true today that ... the the chamber of commerce tribe pipes and let's go wish that both go was known for something else right right the er at there there is a house where the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of a more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um [noise] uh but if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but uh where the ... ... knowing for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right the um\nUh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial\nTo the victims victims were mostly poor people most people without\nA without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community\nUh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them or by that I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... where there is an effort to try to do just enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economic speech that explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of down is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trades crimes with the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it and you're still they they could tell yeah oh that's that house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places\nSo many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but in some of that I've caught still quite well remembered\nSo I wanted you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\n[noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so sorry I got the wrong\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the men from the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but the the shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of tired of family and what a bad as it is a rare that it was them it is now but uh there were very very unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean even as you mentioned there just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding but so let's let's let's go down this path\nOf of the process that you use to try to actually\nYou know narrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example for us and including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor that coincided\nWith the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world that shared similar characteristics as the\nThe crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know well the sailor went from this port to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it it just it but you have to you almost have to START I mean it it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe I'm ... you know to to look at it a broad\nUm you know to to look in the broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing research like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name to even be found given the scarcity and information about you know people are public registries during that period\n... you mentioned that Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks saying jak the river was this guy or whatever was that guy or jak with\nThe er and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the uh I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says she didn't expect to find them but I didn't the um [noise] a lot when we walk the crimes backward a there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight\nThat Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe uh uh but the number of details that match up from the first crime to let's save Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would\nYou would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah at least you to read you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally mean yes newly will listen I go to the Clinton didn't go through the similarities for\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the detect the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy I mean does that crime a month ago down\nSouth Portland the uh uh\nThat criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals they wish there were a pair of boots France that were central to the trial\nA again size six feet there was a very uh the the so we we know that this was a small ...\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did we know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling if a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you could say clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right handed that's a pretty easy thing to see it was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap than he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise] we had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him or her stories about him specifically say that he was an experience longer [noise]\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the a creepy about some girl\nA that was there in the first crime in the first cry you always feel the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did in first grade\nAnd ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThey he always used the one side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never kill anyone with a sharp type backs but it was always his intention to use the blind side of the acts\nIn this first crime lots side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that they are so that crime just matches up on too many point\nFor you to think that this isn't him\nSo then she started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile ... longer axe murderer I'm ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who could when it first crime is obvious who had committed it because he was living with the family which that's the comment paying a cereal murders for crime he often kills people to home and he is directly connected and\nCan be a tie so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who had done it because he fled the scene and I was so they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a new demand on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that with your ... he ... he was a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um this is speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found the uh the the ships record in which he entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller\nHad entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know he was bowl like it and then walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh\nUh uh they they so if he had been in the German army\nA German Navy so uh they found the ship within which came what came into the okay\nThe sailors gate in reference to lack of nutrition for the bowl leg goodness\nIt's not always easy being a debt\nAnd no one knew she was not but it's always worth it [noise] you\nKnow smoking can have the biggest impact on a child's life\nYou'd gain for their kids\nTake time to be a dead today all eight seven four dead for one one visit ... brought to you by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ad council\nCan we just enjoy the dry\nMarcia gay harden how did you get any or they're getting older not battle here brains changing\n... can do to make the money is your age really\nAbout that but not me\nLearn how to help reduce some risks to your brain that bring out the\nSunrise now just hours away in a city changed forever I'm Del Walters they continue to mourn in Pittsburgh side of the nation's latest massacre forty six year old Robert Bauer is accused of opening fire inside a synagogue in that city\n\nPolice releasing the audio from dispatched tapes late Saturday evening the shooter identified as forty six year old Robert Bauer is charged with one a non federal charges eleven counts of murder Bowers is now in stable condition after being wounded in the shootout meanwhile Pittsburgh is a city tried to make sense of it all\nI'm devastated I'm hurt I'm angry and I'm really anxious about\nWho visit to find out who the victim sharks I Know a lot of people who are members of tree of life and this is just so\nHurtful bitter Gilmore speaking at a vigil Saturday Night you'll more among the hundreds who gather to pay their respects that attack being called the worst attack on Jews in us history election day now a little more than a week away but millions of Americans have already made up their minds and voted\nExpected about forty percent of mid term election voters will vote early United States that have opened voting centers of weeks before election day that figure will be even higher earning Michigan is director of the Fox news decision desk and just a trend means campaigns need to close\nEarlier and it means that the messages have to be more carefully tailored to get that vote but it's it's a trend that I think we're definitely going to continue to stay\nMichigan says it's unlikely early voting can build new support for either party but it can guarantee likely voters are definite voters in Washington ...

[noise]\nSo grab a line here and join the conversation with Bill James I think we've covered a lot of things demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer how he\nDid it Ninety death um and yet as he says it's not not even sure that they know all of the people that this man Paul Miller\nOr could have killed starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped um but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next on coast to coast am dizzy and bought it\nIf it was a mostly a like an act that was found in would pile ... almost all of the house I see the murders were uh were houses burn wood\nUh uh we're houses burn would sometimes coal\nA buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the\nCoal right he would he would use the coal actually\nThe boy that would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWas you know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of stigma\nBring the evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the act from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house that's when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax\nOh yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah\nThis is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties and sixties and we had an accident ... that's not our house and I I\nChopped a lot of with with him to a burning out\nYou know my dad till the similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would tempt to fight over who's going to be chopping wood\nAnd and when we were growing up we had an ax around like we we did a lot of would jump in for some reason I've done the desk doing All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago and the first time caller line for Bill James author of\nThe men from the train very interesting Paxton Hi\nGuys fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily out pose this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guests village feet he noticed any ... any parallels between pose a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically the berries and acts and his wife had right that's the way he describes it and and one of the least calm he he's not going to be caught so\nYou know he he had walked the cat up and to the wall and uh you know we tried to get brought them into the basement and said look how how the ... but he always tried to get himself or what\nThe uh uh by the way while doing research on the crime book I I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six\nOr which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... his base the a a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime choices as I'm sure you know they are anyway the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not\nTrying to get caught in fact many many many cereal murders are sort of\nPlaying games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it\nUh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual a aversion to being ... he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out evasive action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even you know if there was a hundred dollar sitting on a shelf there\n... you wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene he a lot of people were executed for that the uh so no he was he was very quite unusual extent\nYeah have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint right there I think for a guy who didn't have any money ... that that shows the disciplines I'm now you mentioned as good a marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\n... high ... in\nUm well I was calling because I I was kinda curious first of all how you got you're talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were in fact the game and murder happened after the civil war in our family um and he was my great however many that\nGrandfather that was he was killed when an act\nAnd then I think that his wife and\nMaybe a fan did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted and um he lives right out and I feel like I guess they have that field workers would be blamed for back anyway and we were in fact and that and then my brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail or tail and the guy about two years I guess right now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nI was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about a person\nYou um you know where they're from but I'm Wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he sang who have no and when and\nWhere is it seems to perfect for the first time is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about go walk through\nThe ... and uh I Wish there was a big help would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't I mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can and we ... we could\nRitual and I were to sit out the salt in other series of crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us because he wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us\nUm again says or even the re let's go to my uh ... in New York uh for a Bill James and coast to coast am\nYes good morning gentlemen and went to light to ah I see a ... year back in the saddle that's a good luck with that weapon looking forward to it\nBut I have um a a two part question with some comment and I'll listen I'm over the ah was not the ad in New York it's it's over the Internet [laughter] set price part is now we have\nIs that she would already faces at at hand ah people at the FBI or can fit that profile is so I didn't know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of might might like this guy out\nLike for that I'm also I like to hear more about and whether it's in a book in time to somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um\nRound up but not even going to trial but get name Lynch and the last part is a ... you mentioned about the state police at this time at that time that the ... century that thought a um [noise]\nI Am I recently read a book by you\nKnow ... it's called how I became white it has on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually tried to police besides the fact that you know they had to I was looking for a fugitive\nBlack folk but they off this black then as basically competing gangs I basically street gang with volunteer fire department\nThat ad can eating spite thin and ... and and I like in common that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as sad that fall on then to finally said I listen all over the Internet thank you so much I don't\nWant to thank you for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they are I wrote about them in the book popular crime or the war\nIn a it was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York and I want to say in Eighteen forty\nFive or thereabouts a poll poll\nFictionalized says the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a a\nHouses was assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kind of terrorizing the city so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story isn't it\nDidn't hang on I'm going to put opinion because we're going to get back to ...\nAnd and the ... just definitely in the book and then the state of the police news or the other questions you have a chance to answer coming up to minute Dennis and games please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast waiting to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were in fact gangs of a fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets of New York right to Scorsese movie ... ... there's a lot of them to illustrate it in there that's kinda cool but she left it because the question about what it if you had a modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI have it at that because that would be\nOh I haven't asked them do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean you know what this is my\nBook is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the uh uh John Douglass monitored a wellness profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... the crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean he is on the chart of how organized as this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that\nRobert ... Kelly who was accused of the murders and ... really couldn't have done it hey because his mind is very disorganized\nBut also because he was not physically strong enough\nUm we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah there's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't\nHaven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine so a lot of the book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine in Nineteen oh to a man named Henry Lambert who was white obviously MSN was accused of the crime ...\nHe was just a a he was a a a knock her out and it was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit he was accused of the crime and was in prison for Twenty years\nUh before a he became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually work work trying to free him and did free the governor of the main eventually I grab it grab a full pardon to him on it aren't based on a ... on actual innocence\nA buddy that happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like\nThat in this in the book it's it's quite it's a terrible side effects of what happened or not\nThe New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York city police were relatively organized and relatively sophisticated not relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these\nCrimes occurred in places it didn't have a place to park they are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it the er so it's not it's not really that the uh not really that connected to my book [noise]\n[noise] no no I'm just ... ... ... in that movie how those gangs tied to operate within government and they were everybody was mine for job even if that meant getting in to keep them um\nAnd and um and by the way I think profiling or would you endorse what\nYou've done I think you might think you'd be doing ... and the way in which the when I Hope so it's a nice of you know really mean I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights and there but this is the first time caller Jay does in Chicago until she goes day in ... Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead and say\nI'm I'm Glad to hear you back I call it calls\nThank you miss yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments first Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor Mac or for baseball\n[noise] so I have heard and eh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm like deal for you to bring it up in in law him for that\nBut yeah I yeah I I I think he needs to be louder for that I use that as a visor either painted visors the Boston Red Sox now but he basically I'm about to save all actors so his ... and I and what is China than about my this book\nIs I think you can listen to the bottom of why I I'll forgive me for that because I Love you and what's the broader point\nYou think I'm missing\n[noise] I think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to a legend\nWell it's not the only thing happened if I had been a ... appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my 'em up on\nThe average age you're saying that that gave it's awfully nice of you the er here for the poor guy\nDavid probably nice of you know the idea of a bar to go back to the McCain but uh\nMy most of my career has been working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge that and a first date your time comic\nI entered fair that I understand why you wouldn't want to make it connected to but I just think that needs to be sad that he has a live in\nA packed and he's very very far more enjoyable for me throughout my whole life and they have your ... or you know you know than bill\nBut anyway the the reason I call them is silly thing at a time of year why you've pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was the first smarter than Boston around you are\nAnd and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the border in Merced yes orders and if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is a it could be connected to New Orleans packs murderers and and the answer that wasn't easy no they're absolutely the knock connected to the New Orleans ax murder the but the Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murderers aperture committed with a heavy acts the ... in the middle of the night the Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand to hatch at hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of uh\nBut I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr couldn't say that it you know and all the connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh\nUh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska\nSo that's an opt connection\n[noise] uh and I think the ... the boarding pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and maybe speaks to the idea of going into a ... does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was how it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an act that was near ... no that was that the property that tune sides um and the idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen\nWhich is another piece because you know that was you know why why would somebody go into the house\nAnd killed were it not for that that was the part of the motive piece that was presented you know against ... board and it was a she stood do inherent property which makes sense but it did it did give me a moment to where I was thinking about their let's go to a dentist is in New York on coast to coast am\nFor Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis\n...\nIt's been a wonderful program on ... thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nLed to have 'em\nAnd you know I'm I'm I'm Glad you're back I listen to you for years and I [noise] I Know your way through to the problems there are a little ...

cloaking device was just outside of earth's atmosphere remembered you eat the Canadians first\nA and a and for for for good reason to uh visit that time of year when you could probably get away with it in Roswell New Mexico so you know start north get their actual aliens walking round rouse well\nThey might be able to blend in really well with the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em\nTo a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we are not competing again he extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game but but but tonight a little different a vote socks lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at a coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but [noise] but let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com it's a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the tone upon test range in Nevada\nUm and what they have recently uncovered but what if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who won needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nWrong so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell I'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity at people moved to Ross\nAnd you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do it if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all your lungs in a way for some people would the discussion of aliens in invading armies in the ... if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to graves farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn ...\nUh the ... family uh put the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they change\nIt every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you\nKnow that haunted feeling of getting lost in a field like a UFO a\nCrash in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom line is like state park ah which again has and history at the bottom lists and\nAnd it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and\nUh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that landed and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I'll be traveling to Raj will I'm moving coming up them in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA minute position will be teaching at Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to go get Roswell right so we we we mapped out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to dip ... well before we came back up again\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there is anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nOr ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of depression Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a UFO tour that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take you to\nThe exact location of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the book or families where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take it out to the crash site where a Mac rebels rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the creator and landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things\nThat I Would definitely recommend that people checked out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so when you to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh\nThe locals know who the tourists are because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great store or bringing your camera take pictures talk in the ... visitor center we have two amazing aliens that we decorate\nFor each holiday especially now for Halloween [laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community\nBut um these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers month his name is Bob and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd we as locals we we don't want to say one way or the\nOther we want them to figure it out for themselves and and do their research\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for that\n... we want that figure it out for themselves and you're very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUntil our population has doubled in size where we're at town about forty thousand I'm actually on the big anniversary of all I'm you know we hit close to ... our our eyes on average per year for Korean family a little over two hundred\nAnd thirty out in ... ... ... and her\nParty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Juanita and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance they'll say hello okay yes prepare things where\nThe ... to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you resist great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic aside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October is that about right\n[noise] yeah it's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course of the month and a quarter million so the massive amount of people that small city to have that its borders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nUh that that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the wife of the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yeah injuries but\nWe don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that lives but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being being asked you for being which is going to the strange thing about that to me of course is that all of the planet that have had this problem just pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with our co payments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act\nNow our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks my this is Michael methods for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance called late on red fix nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo uh Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven ... Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt licorice or England or London\nThat's the we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt Lincoln, England\nA long ago turned ... tend to which is incident which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's which memorial for the more than ... victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but at Salem that\nSticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with crafts\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors obviously they get Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing oh\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of stay on grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame right I mean it's not that's not usually what it sounds holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago's celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't have these don't go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now I think that's true and I think to sort of that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations or around Salem the actual\nThe actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver's was at the time to film village\nFor sale itself does have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim was trials I mean the actual which is I Lived there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since then it was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a Herman which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess it and this is important in a ... this is great distinction can't help but feel do it sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder said they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry kind of build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that's Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably ... century that a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy this kind of underneath the underneath or Fort Worth so to speak\nAnd part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around you know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty eighth team\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nOh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween\nDay I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really has bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found that Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras makes you\nIt is it really is um your talk again hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to work costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras\nAlgae 'cause you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same city did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that cuts down right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween booze as a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean Salem known for being hunted either see Lin wood Denver's former Salem ... are there are a lot of haunted houses were were there are there's still visitations from the victims of the original ceiling trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of apology around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters because of the film which trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and empty and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see\nAll those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there you go there so oh yeah all the time I was there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I don't that career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest in that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trained victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real\nYou know real actual snorkel vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of colleges around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was or somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm here with her and attempt to for him to do like to say on or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station\nAnd he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in town a performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active

we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll\nWe'll go around the horn 'em\nTo a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of a season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago about uh the Salem witch trials and how historians\nHave been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we're not competing again\nHe extended the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different a vote socks lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBut let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah uh it it would all be over now the boss to be going home with a trophy up at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that has created in the very first version of a robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties a sit down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nMay have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense\nInsider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but what if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kind of happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nFederal so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity at people move to rouse while all the time but this is that time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what\nSome people with the discussion is alien invading armies and all of that is if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to graves farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about\nSeven miles out of town where they participate in the corn maze\nOr the ... family uh put the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they change it every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you know that haunted feeling of getting lost in a field like\nA UFO a crashed in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom less like state park ah which again has a mystery at the bottom lists and\nAnd it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful lake great place to RV camp and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that landed and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I I'll be traveling to Raj will I'm moving coming up them in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose well on my way to\nA new position will be teaching at Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to do good Roswell Rachel we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to dip ... well before we come back up again\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there anybody we're interested in being able to\nGo to the crash site um or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm\nDefinitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first\nFor over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the book or families where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out\nAnd um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened to you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nYou get the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great store I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have to amazing aliens that we'd decorate for each holiday especially now for Halloween [laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with our police\nOfficers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and they'll hear the story of you know our employee of the month his name is Bob and mark the ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching\nFor the truth and we as locals we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and do the research\nWell that'd be great thank you and we should let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the U.S food and\nSo our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size\nHoney you're\nPretty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Anita and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance I'll say hello okay\nYeah okay yeah\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and may have Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book you read a great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic side on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary placed in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah that's about right a city of about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course the month than a quarter million so the massive amount of people that small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this was one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the er the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that a ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that said I wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the wife of the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for them you know there are you know the first for trout America you\nKnow the victim was in Connecticut in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of the court yet injury\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which is killed\nIt is and it's it's really a problem today even in in um north of the country there's still where people are being asked you for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course of the planet that have had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still a Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nOn the way I liked the rub zombie story there\nStart hiring with links that go to link dot com slash working to get fifty dollars off your first stop her perfect conditions applied\nGeico presents eyewitness interviews with inanimate objects\nDidn't belong to colleagues of mine on the the never return how storm here to describe the\nPro I was hanging on the roof when it's normally storm starts dropping faith ... goes got feed off of you know what the Savage anything to help Nobre I was in survival mode\nYour football can help you want to hail storm but that guy go insurance agency can help you get covered for personal property damage called guy go to see how affordable homeowner's insurance can be\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven viral do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt Lancaster, England\nA long ago turned its ... which is incident which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw\nIn Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but at Salem\nThat sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\nIt it's really a mystery I think that's one of the big question\nIt's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\nOh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why I kinda Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nThen it's kind of a you know you it's amount of courage shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what it sounds holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from runs well in in that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf the crazy real killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now I think that's true and I think to try that one is that you know the tragedy\nIn Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was the ... part of the trials right actual\nFamily members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations or around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver's was at the time to film village for sale itself does have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was just the sight of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is that live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since then it was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a Herman which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess and this is important in a ... great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of\nMurder [laughter] they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath there for board so to speak and part of it that's less connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty eighth thing\nWell go back to many central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nOh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween\nDay I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and then October thirty first um but really has bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found the Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras me\nIt is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras was a good analogy because\nYou're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same DVD did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol in consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right booted up part of it like this is within the party\nOkay so you you mentioned haunted happening but I mean Salem\nKnown for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's former Salem ... are there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have\nEverything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims\nYou have monsters because of the Senate most trial didn't just involved which is in the story involves demons and m's than shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other five the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time all the time they're two weekends ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the ... and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the best the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one of the really creepy ones is one of the Boston trained victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical events that then I can reverberate and have come it's all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape prone to jail they're\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kinda stuff kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of uh of mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there's somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there and it can do for him to do like bumped to stay on or something while he was there\nNo no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there the original police that station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know scape\nAs a PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there do in order to stay on the bus thing but they're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike so you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into the\nFor how they unimaginable tons of

I did um [noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an interest in Boston Straggler case and publish some theories about it which might be right or wrong who knows [laughter]\nWell I Love that I think I may revisited that because I've always been very interested in that as well but demands on the train is a story it speaks to something I I mentioned earlier I was interviewing Lynch and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told\nA ... when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not she said it doesn't matter how old the story is\nShe said what which best is it's actually you is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also is true for all the time that that will be of there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now these totally innocent\n[noise] they are right there there are two while they're there for people who were actually ... executed\nFor crimes that may have been convicted by the man trying to them I Would go so far as I say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed and I'm Alive\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure the uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob who when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last year we are pretty sure that was him what I can quote all although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that at Penn\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm\nHome alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered along with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh\nAnd ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them um but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second and that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible we haven't we assume that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA sick segment curb a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear about hand scratching at writing now\n[laughter] when that guy murder or a hundred years ago I tried\nTo actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong or you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway\nSo how many people do we think\nPolk anyway so how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator demand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and bucket right there's a hundred percent pocket that his crimes were certainly yeah Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and a ten percent bucket right and then where total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was a criminal and the murder of the total we came up with as a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome terms of the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims rich guy who cooks right All right so ... gets through a typical crime\nAs you as you see the pattern developing in the late\n... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nThis is a long this is this could be a long answer I'm not along with the person who's going to be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often family including how young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a pound too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks the I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an AK\n... is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they actually there's a ban them at the same that the crime the handlers washed her fingerprints\nThe house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are locked the or or something\nIs jammed in the door [noise]\nSon devils getting big they are kind of fun a show the we were just a hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I I had to cut you off because we're the heartbreak at the bottom of the\nReally it was triggered or up to it because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to\nFind them several ... that's like a little bit more of the ... what's that I sort of like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they ah the crime normally heard on Sunday nights I use the ... on the weekends up until Nineteen pan the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one\nOf the primary industries was logging the or\nDoors or doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's oh there are clear deer graphic pattern and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curves just north of Portland or so that that would be a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house term they wear way down low so that you just gave up a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lap unfettered on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lap around with him if he committed murders and the other thing is that he would uh put poet blankets over the head of a frequent person or a half a second before you had with Iraq are you there are a lot and they probably did that to\nKeep the blog from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nOrdering someone who you are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that\nIt would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new and that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin and it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just run the other side of Chicago so very likely couldn't couldn't follow the bullet or another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether his first crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plant that probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through a cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about the Americans most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murderer in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on it secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never fully known\nAnd are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled them this\nThis person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\n[noise] yeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they couldn't have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims but were John Wayne gain the using run away some of the things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train as ... as he's called\nIn and we have to call them that although we get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime is a little bit later on almost don't want to because I don't want to ruin so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but\nThen there was a couple of good football games I got distracted dinner so the ... but this\nGuy he nobody it it it would be president does him for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the a wire services at that time\nIn Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInformation of this tight had little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve the national wire services were\nWere organized to have a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nAnd ah October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this has ham and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even wham logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes that there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than ... miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that I mean we're in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't\nThe first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man Howard little who was later executed for\nAnd the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other but that doesn't just speech\nIt was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speech to the lack of said the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true\nAnd that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time ... I I thought I was probably knowledgeable about it I was astonished to\nRealize how backward and ineffective address digital system was just a hundred years ago ... it's beyond belief how premise of the the investigative\nProcess as war at the time of the crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThe uh he knew that if you committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered there was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew that if he committed the crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it\nBut if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force\nFirst of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\n[noise] and and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's ... ... and ... this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... even in prosecuting that\nSome of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties I'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science\nUm yeah and I ... I wrote about this little bit in in a in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is ... it's it's not science look at all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course we look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI effect when expecting\nThe forensic to be presented to them like it is on the TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they they were resistant to it\nGood luck honey\nShe's still not smiling maybe he's not us from Iowa yeah maybe he's just not a happy baby maybe he's just being a boy or maybe ...

serial killer how he did\nIt Ninety death um and yet as he says it's not even sure that they know all of the people that this man Paul Miller a could've killed starting an Eighteen Ninety eight until he was a well until he stopped\nUm but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next uh coast to coast am this is Ian but it\n... uh mostly uh like an act that was found in would pile ... almost all of the house and I met at the murders\nWere uh were houses burn wood\nUh we're houses burn wood times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to\nSplit the wood or break up the cold right he would\nHe would use the coal actually the boys would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWas she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of stinking\nPrint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten in Nineteen time it was very common for people to have an ax\nOh yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah dogs are is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town\nIn the Nineteen fifties fifties and sixties and we had an accident\nWhat bottle outside our house and I I chopped a lot of with with them or to a burning out\nYeah my dad till the similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood\nAnd and when we were growing up we had an ax around like we we did a lot of woods jumping for some reason I've done the judge doing All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago and the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily how close is highly year and I I wanted to ask your guests village feet he noticed any ... any parallels between holds a vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically berries that acts as wise head right that's the way he describes it and and when the least calm he is not going to be caught so\nYou know he had walked the cat up into the wall and uh you know he tried to get brought him into the basement and said look how solid wall was but he always collected given so what\nThe ... by the way while doing research on the crime but\nI I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six a which is apparently the original story from which the casket with ... his base the a a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime choices as I'm sure you know\nThey are anyway the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not\nTrying to get caught in ... many many many serial murderers are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being ... he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out your base of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on a shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene he a lot of people were executed for that the uh so no he was he was very quite unusual extent\nYeah I had a an aversion to being caught\n... series restraint right there I think we're a guy who didn't have any money the the uh the chosen disciplines I'm negative back soon as good a marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James Marie\n... high ... in in\nUm well I was calling because I I was kinda curious person about how you got just talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were in fact the gay and murder happened\nAfter the civil war in our family um and he was my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed when an act\nAnd then that can that his wife and\nMaybe a fan did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted and um he lives right out and I feel like I guess they have that field workers would be blamed for it but anyway in ... we were invested in that and then my brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail or Tehran a guy about two years ago right now so if there's a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about a person you know\nEarlier about a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be\n[noise] he was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out I mean about a person if you um\nYou know where they're from but I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he's saying who have known what and when\nAnd where is it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very story about go walk through the ... and ah I Wish there was a big help to would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't I mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the\nAbout the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can and we ... we could ritual and I were to sit out so in other series of crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us it's because he wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing it was just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up the workforce\nUm again with the religion to chew my uh do in New York\nAh for a Bill James on goes to goes to a um\nYes good morning gentlemen and when the light to ah I see a ... year back in the satellites and\nWe're a good luck with that Web looking\nForward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment and I'll listen I'm over the uh well it's not to add New York it's it's\nOver the Internet [laughter] first\nThought is now we have is that she would already pages at at hand ah people at the FBI or consider that profile is so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of Mike Mike slash this guy out\nMuch further um also I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in the book and time into somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um [noise] wound up but not even going to trial but getting England\nAnd the last part is a I mentioned about the state that the police at this time at the time that the ... century that thought a um [noise] I Am I recently read a book by um you\nKnow ... it's called how I became white this is on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually describe the police besides the fact that you know they had like two hours looking for fugitive\nBlack folk like pay off this black then as basically\nCompeting gangs basically street gangs wouldn't volunteer fire department\nThat had competing fights and and demonstrations and I'd like to comment whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as a that formed in the police and I'll listen over over the Internet thank you so much\nFor your for your most intelligent questions\nI'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and\nPretty civil war because a A R I wrote about them in the book popular crime or the war in a it was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York yeah and I wanted to say in\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts\nA poll poll fictionalized says the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that\nCrime but they they it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA houses was assembly Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they and they were kinda terrorizing the city I so yeah I I Do the that's an odd story of\nThe new hang on I'm going to put opinion right there because we want to get back to ...\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast we need to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question um we talked about how there were in fact gangs of a fire departments and and I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go\nThere's a lot of them than symbols treated the news it's kinda cool but she left it because the question about what it Indiana modern police were FBI profile or take a look at this case\nBut I haven't asked them do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean you know what this is my\nBook is written to say this is what I think and if you think something different that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the ah John Douglass monitored a well known profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it on the chart of how organized is is burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that\nRobert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is it for us to really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized\nBut also because he was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so yeah\nThere's something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked her profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine some of the book is about\nInnocence accused of a crime that I'll tell you briefly just one of the stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a\nMan named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously and that's that was accused of the crime\n[noise] he was just a a he was a a a knock around me was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and was in prison for Twenty years or before a it became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually work work trying to free him and did free um the governor of Maine but eventually\nA graphic out of a full pardon to him all that aren't based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy that happened after we spent forty years in\nJail there are a lot of stories like that in the in the book it's ... it's quite it's a terrible side effects of what happened or not to get\nThe New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred these crimes occurred in places that didn't have a police department\nThey are they are they had like a city Marshall and that was it the ah so it's not it's not really that the uh not really that connected to my book\n[noise] you know there are no um let me just to illustrate ... in that movie of how those gangs tied to operate within the government and they were everybody was mine for job even if that meant getting in like to keep them\nUm and and um and by the way I think profiling or would do indoors what you've done I think you might think you'd be a very proud of the way in which the what I Hope\nSo it's a nice view it as I Know it really did I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but this is the first time caller Jay does in Chicago until she closed am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead and say\nI'm I'm Glad to hear you back I call it calls\nThank you miss yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments first Mr james you're a large and\nI think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor Mac or for baseball\n[noise] so I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know I heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm deal for you to bring it up in in law him for that\nBut yeah I yeah I I I think he needs to be lauded for that I use additive visor you pay to buy or just the Boston Red Sox now but he basically gave that to save a lack of his entire life and I and what is China's\nThan about ... as far as I think you're kind of listen to the bottom of why I I'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nAnd what's the broader point you think I'm missing\n[noise] I think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to alleging\nOkay well it was built by having if I happen to ... appropriately treated us\nDavid solvent I could do the right here for the poor girl but that McCain but uh\nMy both my career has been working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge that and a bridge that you're kind of comic\nI understand that I understand why you wouldn't want to make it connected to but I just think that needs to be sad that he has allied Gen our bags and he's very very far more enjoyable for me throughout my whole life and they have your ... or you know you know than bill\nBut anyway the the reason I call them is a thing as time of year like you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine

it's a fair question the question we get a lot is a it could be connected to New Orleans tax murders and and the answer that with his easy no they're absolutely the not connected to New Orleans ax murder the but the Lizzie Borden cases not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murderers aperture committed with a heavy AK ... in the middle of the night the Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand the hatchet hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the\nBut I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr couldn't say that it you know and all connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh\nUh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska\nSo that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and I think the Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and and needy speaks to the idea of going into a ... does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an act that was near a hat you know that was that the property that total inside\nUm and the idea that it was in and out really quickly and then nothing was stolen which is another piece because you know that was you know why why would

coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll\nWe'll go around the horn 'em\nTo a couple of places that are celebrating Halloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago about uh the Salem witch trials and how historians\nHave been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this was this was a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston\nHe was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we are not competing again he extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nOr sit down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding of life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the tone upon test range in Nevada\nUm and what they have recently uncovered\nBut what if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell I'm kind of happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who Juanita Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nWill so Juanita\nThat evening Juanita can evening so ... is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as you travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to rouse while all the time to just the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities right just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Raj will kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people would the discussion of aliens invading armies and all of that is if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to graves farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn ...\nUh the ... family uh put the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven\nOr they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you know that haunted feeling of getting lost\nIn a field like a UFO a crashed in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom less like state park ah which again has and history at the bottom lists and\nAnd it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful lake great place to RV camp and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and\nUh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around\nHalloween and during the UFO festival in July\nSo I I I'll be traveling ... moving coming up them in a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose well on my way to\nA minute position will be teaching the Kansas State and my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to go get Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to get to the Roswell before we came back up again\nIt seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there is anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site\nUm or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of depression Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year firmly in Research Center which um is\nA great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a UFO tour that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact location of the timing of the incident\nAnd on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so when you to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals\nKnow who the tourists are because at the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that new one which is a great store a bringing your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two amazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] he puts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot\nAliens and people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know our employee of the month his name is Bob and ... and uh you know people really come here searching\nFor the truth and we as locals we we\nDon't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and\nAnd one way or the ... we want them to figure it out for themselves and you're very\nWell that'd be great thank you I appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Roswell for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nOn our population has doubled in size where we're at about forty thousand on especially on the big on ever since I've got basketball um you know ... ... ... ... are five on average per year for Korean family over two hundred and\nThirty thousand ... ... ... in every\nCounty good pretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Anita and if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance I'll say hello okay\nYes please thank you\nHoney to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism or public affairs in uh Roswell\nNew Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar the subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book you great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside\nOn a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah that's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people um and of course the month if it's in the quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of bugs it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween in say about the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know there are you know the first for trout America you know the victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of the court yet injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt isn't it honestly it's really a problem today even in ... and I'm also developed country there's still winter if people are being asked you for being with us but the the the strange thing about that to me of course all the things on the planet that I've had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and I feel in Massachusetts\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased\nHelp to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with our co payments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael methods for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt link usher England a law\nThe ... century witch hunt linked in England\nA long ago turned ... incident which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden which memorial for the more than ... who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but a Salem\nThat sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the crowd\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that for the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\nOh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held onto it over the course about two centuries\nBut it's kind of you know ... it's the moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even\nYou know it's we just talked to somebody from runs well and and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf the crazy people are treated the famous worlds expedition right you don't know what are these don't go on their way to put up signs and go see it happen here folks\n[laughter] right now I think that's true and I think too that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual\nThe actual stereo started next door and what's now Denver's was at the time to film village\nFor sale itself does have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the proceedings um and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which has lived there today\nIt means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since since then it was kind of become Halloween town as well so it's a term or which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important in a ... great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering\nThat this this really is about innocent victims of murder and they were executed and did they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath or Fort Worth so to speak and part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around\nYou know city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and and twenty anything\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nOh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween\nDay I mean they celebrate a season basically for that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really has bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit founder Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd with a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from\nThe city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras basically\nIt is it really is um your talk again a hundred thousand people packed the small downtime with the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to work ... it was a freak each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nBut ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October it's cold is which is to in ... in ...\nOctober ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol consumed during this celebration\nDefinitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts\nThat many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween booze is a part of it but this is within the party\nOkay Joe ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean Salem known for being hunted either ... or there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the originals Zealand trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film which trial then just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and apps and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mash see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um ghost tours their spooky places there's the other five the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time out there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah let's let's the bench what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trailer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical event that then I can reverberate and have kind of followed around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know the cops kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was a the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station\nAnd he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know scape as PR move for his next big event so now he wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but if you're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into\nOh it's great for my favorite elements of the founders of city in complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the witches and the winters have this really strange position where they call themselves which is a ... you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City",
