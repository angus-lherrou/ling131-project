explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about uh about sigh boards too about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about ... more than that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am this is the infinite [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I'd been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they separate the monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've tried to have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise\nOnly a who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it [noise] so we're at once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart\nTransplant sure you remember that a a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at oh my God way way putting them which I had a mechanical hard in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and yeah exactly and and and and and\nAnd you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a we're even getting past the mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota yeah I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but there you are\nNo you're right that the minute you University of Minnesota's mustard recently did a huge reserves you it's an it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called come era's they're sheep human and pick human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and sheep DNA or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nA but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility United discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or pick I mean these these are the things that are very real now\nBecause of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like you know made up all pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admit yeah we got to be careful this is a possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even the end I H is kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for\nThe guard rails I'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just to get a violation of the agent probably doing it against the advice of the moms yeah what do you do yeah yeah you know oh my\nOh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ...\nSays the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage of the of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nAnd I don't ... I Would filled balloons up with it\nAnd then send little insects aloft just to see\nWhat happens that's a ... I was eight and a little mad scientist in the area and create your own\nSpace program against their will right by the by the way\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say why don't you don't get it right in that already go play tiddlywinks or something safer\nMentioned LA ... as you mentioned earlier when you mentioned that the the game is still tied into fifteenth between Boston and LA you\nKidding me know so I didn't know what I mean the ending Fifteen any\nGame three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like thinking of pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of work and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors 'cause that's how that's how it was happening right now still lose two men on\nTop of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it so sorry Joe ... but the the island a doctor\nTo keep an eye on it so sorry Joe ... the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is\nBut I I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for which I'm\nYou know we're theory you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look out a window Siri is it snowing you know or you know Google ... by me\nSome you know by me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials or the ... everybody's focused on that type of the ... and I kinda get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's\nThe other thing we're bringing about our cell okay you're a ... if you're absolutely\nRight I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by me you know there's a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson in like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... election now\nAre you kidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders of yeah I Know it's\nSo big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and\nAgain I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple wash and record his torture and death now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe it there in the Saudi constantly they have a they have Google\nAnd they had the little series whenever there and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on that we had not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationship or for our communities\nAnd for the security of our country I just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so I was saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThat kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's going to have\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than a billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to bug us to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you're talking about the show he thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHi Michael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the least looked into it and his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing of these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ...\nAnd they found out that they they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the Austin\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the husband he ended up being charged with murder ... this this kind of a Internet of things\nOr you can cause of this this kind of a Internet of things that are fine on every aspects of our life that can tell you when you were asleep when you're awake how many feet you walk what your heart rate I you know if you watch Netflix see the the they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited it on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I like kill a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same\nThing they took it from the real life oh did you know they always do you know\nWritten from Janine headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to go good they kind of killer because of the ...\nThe hard part would be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system which accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit a crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having as a humongous database of face print\nRight uh that they've got you covered in the ... yeah\nAnd and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRoom with which raises the possibility that\nYou and I can have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but\nThe facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know that let's get Hugh key who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me am perfectly good ah are you tonight on my own turned back up there you go and you had a question from Michael yes Michael and I are you are speaking about the ah\nJarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because it's very experience\nAnd service even there was a whistle blower is called them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things [noise] um one of the um [noise] [noise] [noise] predecessors that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp heartless at the University of Utah\nAnd ... years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically a ... or whatever it was\n... right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions said he was able to see on his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open mind called the sounds more like that did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah um I like wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to the cause I Know there's two ... we had our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of blown\nSo let me go to a treaty who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where ... where did you just stop when did we stop playing God\nOr are we have we that's a good question but are we playing God yeah and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nWe played God is maybe is another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and ah you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to trace is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is what we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your your your pick your imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or that\nCan read it with him right there but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise far we playing God or are we would we cure a disease if the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and yours is hurricanes\nAre we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid the phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase rightly\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean that can be said we're playing ... ... ... what I like to do is what I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nI what I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil field a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I have to get their ... through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mind that it's gonna do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous never mind that great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes\nFor us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nFor

on her response was a professional person but can't ask coop Mohamed was and there was a famous religious leader hey garbage in garbage out buddy\nYup a very interesting thanks I hadn't heard that about a Alaska Alexis but and that's how they programmed her to to say that this is of course wrong and and not accurate I'm not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people\nWho are atheists who studied the subjects come to the conclusion by and large that he was a historical figure a as was Mohammed but that ah it's crazy and I hope they fixed that I that sounds like something that they would lose Silicon Valley though doesn't it\nUh let me go to um marry who's in New Jersey on coast to coast am Mary\nI'm Around how are you I'm from bacteria gas\n[noise] um I

know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it\nIf it's just a a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul that it could occupied but then again you talked to other people who say that I didn't adamant objects you know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach mints\nPlace for you know I'm the spirits from that will are unwilling to leave an area so they

pardon the expression I think we all you know lost their breath over that we do is just cut us off\nGuard so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I yeah I think I think you have to have you with us\nHighway that

I Know that hey\nThis is a kid\nThey said oh my God it's\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly um so what kind of ... what station did your father worked for a ... ...\nDon't Cape deal and\nAnd ... ... ... and they were where oh I'm\nA ... and it keeps them Jeffrey shit I Would like to I was like to hear that you God Bless you have a great night I I've always worked I'm not that technically advance I mean I can handle the little one in probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love the engineers\nThat are really know the stuff that's really cool they could just build something out of nothing\nMe to oh Keith from Virginia is back so Keith had called the um when we were talking\nUnion is back so he had called um when we were talking with our guest less our and it seemed much more appropriate to have money or for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who it was ... you were telling a story about how the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of almost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely\nDelivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um that individual by the way and and uh thanks for having the back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very ... and they are related to some of the things I Want to fight too but\nSure this gentleman Dr wrestle I'm now and uh also had a a ... experience of a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visited him from the spirit world\nAnd delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way it's the same roof I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having less is world renowned medical career became president of the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and let her things in which\nThings revealed bug across the judge gave a little bit more and hiding from time to time I hear things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps the connecting and for ... informed that link about her normal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find them and also in the Bible and and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other ... that he had\nProfits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise] you\nKnow and and they're going to get about thirty more seconds you should go ahead I said basically\nTo wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman maps and there's a very good Youtube video Jennifer Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles seem to have\nBeen lost by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures had been boss that were the basis of the creek\nThey measure pharmacist\nOr want to do the pairs correctly and and the and the jar container so they're all fish out towards out or they get to order it would just have their own fan right there\nYeah that that thing of the the moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in the ... the ... in this little cup holder whose district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making arguments like maybe the jar\nWas on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I I don't get the thing with the the pencils in the in the desert so yeah the Neverland pulled you guys I'll go with that until they've got\nAnd you know the theory to a a backing up Michelle is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nOh wow Hi faith than I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver and I lived here all\nHis first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at all I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have\nWhat I was wondering was like I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you\nKnow I just I don't know that that's the way I felt inside an when listening to your guests Michael I'm closer to when he first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of\nAnd then the late ... yeah that lady told them to read the Bible and now it's\nAnd when that room hair gas Michael I'm closer to when you first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and and the way that lady tell them to read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering\nAnd I don't have a very strong religious stuff exactly but I'm\nA little bit like I ... I Wonder how often\nWhen I'm driving down the road and how it can trust the authenticity of the Bible because\nYou know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it\nLike the story of the ... and the story of a you know like I said you're a hero type take everything line of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ...\n... talk for like ... and ... you know whatever ... gates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the ...\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narrative should the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it is my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not\nTrusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true that it has in it\n[noise] okay\nThere's a there's a difference to me and there are ... that we know to be a worth\nSteering by right there there you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and so there are ... and a lot of these stories tell the truth the actual facts\nOf these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest survival\nIt they'll let you know story that can be found and other places we can still try saying like the other information on the bottom\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who when Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr ... other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that sure whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't that in the Egyptian\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but ... in the end does it matter I mean it it it's do you can you do live your life better\nDoes it improve your life that's the question then I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science [noise] there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think I'm ... and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow come to think of that\nLet's my best answer for you hope it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas\nAnd in a long time out here to things fell [laughter]\nGood will be weird you know if you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a adjusted and who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey\nHey it's nice to be on a list them wherever they were actually called in a heavier controlling and take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want you to the more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure\nIf a lot of people carpet you must interview or he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I smoked doping\nThey're they're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is a definite logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy and a thriving addict augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability yeah these massive computations and access to any kinda\nThese massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just take philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nThen you know it's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nTo have to write it 'cause it's not that it's dance you know or something so I can dance at least ... you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you don't see your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions a big um begun sting ability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that review\nMuch more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must get some big giant slot machine yes\nSome big entity whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I\nI Will Venus is are you know I have a buddy that that's a very intellectual it always has some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small am in a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after the Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly what I live\nIn a day or something like that one effect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I didn't see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque ... right I did in ... I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minutes interview\nOn his dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guys smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels\nCome off right I'm watching the wheels are going in and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I'm I I think anytime the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think you suppose and stuff a little more on it in on public but I mean I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very soon future you know laid off and it was based in two thousand Nineteen you know what I mean right about that but\n[noise] Hi I'm ... even though I never knew my father Hank Williams his legacy taught me the meaning of lending a helping hand\nThat's why I support the Austin foundation of America\nOh if they committed to providing education mentoring in a workplace readiness for thousands of the aging out of the foster care system with the help of what they support programs these young people can go to college and high school graduate and make the leap from foster care to fix them learn how you can yell at Boston dot or\nWhat can we just enjoy that Iran\nMarcia gay harden how did you get any or they're getting older not that long range changing\n... do you think do you think as you age really\nAbout that but not me\nLearn how to help reduce some risks to your brain that bring the idea of\n\nWhat you're breaking the walk off love jak LA on Fox News the longest game of the world series history I think just a few minutes ago and dramatic Russia [noise]\nJoe Buck with the call on Fox ... monkeys home recovering seven hours twenty minutes after the game started making the Dodgers three to two winners\nRed Sox believe the world series two games to one game for later tonight in LA the FBI says the fourteen devices meld all leading Democrats this week we're potentially working bombs they have suspected of sending them now in custody\nA latent fingerprint from a package to California congresswoman Maxine Waters plus other DNA evidence help police identify things are say act that fifty six year old Florida resident accused of sending more than a dozen dangerous packages the former President Obama Hillary Clinton and other high profile Democrats\nNow we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nFBI Director Christopher Wray says the packages each contains six inches of PVC pipe ...

I wanted to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible and uh I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I'm shuttles them subsequently become an atheist agnostic down not so I don't know what to say that you really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack the show that it was just it you know a couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in a base during the week so that kinda bleeds through in the era of afraid\nAnd you know when you said that uh you know people come out of church and then they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because ah\nI Can't possibly bully and my God that show her credit or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other God's up\nYou know in the Bible up you know I can I possibly even yeah wage of ... when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about Passover or a son who loved ... first born Egyptians or the great flood\nOr Saddam ... more of their own ... innocent children killed there so I mean like yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative\nAs being the defining story so I accept what you're saying and I think don't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean nothing district in a sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the ... to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so\nYou know everybody puts their faith in something let me just put it that way well\nPuts their faith in some [noise] would you need the money put your season sex\nYou put your faith in cars that

property in view for um South Carolina\nNo I Love that area I [laughter] I don't I don't get there very often but one of these days on drugs\nI'm a Hilton Head older than you know yeah we're neighbors okay well\nThis caller brought up something about I think you got it off a website where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure a mythical figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was elected they asked no that's what it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections I ever got to heart\nBut yes he did say that it's all immediately triggered him my brains I bought this perfect set of encyclopedias Britannica from the church\nMouse [laughter] or and I was so excited than like God at home I opened it up I might have done it first person to ever open it and I write papers a\nFirst part the first introductory parts\nAnd it was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan wow ... ... ... ... you're going to if you haven't stand is you would probably in ... by them down and explain that this was a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica\nAnd they created\nThe alphabetical volumes and they they chose what to put it at length in that heart and then they end that the other selections at their discretion\nAnd so when you look up Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica it has just a few little paragraphs and it it calls from them that took a figure someone who might have live\nDuring a certain time period and then it represents there's a way to look in the ... or more information and then if you turn to Islam\nIt is like page after page after page in the regular section and still do you know anything about it and\nNo one very interesting it's very ... those are good looking over your shoulder will you talk to you you're doing this it's\nIn it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and I kinda\nFeel like like they're not really\nIn like ... even [laughter]\nYou don't know if you did wrong usually judging reduce the idea that I mean like the as you said I I've I Know they're still printing the much to be printing a brutal hormones are they done completely the hall anything\nAfter the second took a laugh a lot of credit to buy it gave them hung up or at home and saw that in\nFact started looking up things and I thought who is this why didn't you didn't make it this plan so\nYeah you find out I mean if you could do home or I'm\n... I'm very treatment that idea so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I could figure out something between now tomorrow night's\nUh I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to see if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night an otherwise I'm not sure it will be back on again Thanksgiving ... may have to wait a while but moves you what do you do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen who is in Alaska\nOn coast to coast am and Karen\nHi um this link and she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and um it the show was short um first of all I wanted to stay you are by far my favorite\nShow host than to gorge but you don't seem to be afraid of controversial subject [laughter]\nThough because they do that [laughter]\nSo you know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just you know\nYeah you know I I I guess that is funny 'cause I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you said you will you know to say that oh no trail what what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things that I'll get off the air and everybody else and put in a sense where it's um that Mandela Effect first of all a you've probably heard about it\nThere's a million dollars to memory to\nYeah will laugh at all they St Paul's memory\nMemory you know one last call they face off memory\nAnd everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave with them I Believe that ... six in the Bible the wolf and the lamb versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb that a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible you can\nFind hey guess what I got catalog in the mail today\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe kept the catalog print like minded I don't know for our comfort her sister\nRemember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it\nSo Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolate\nSally Field do you remember when she said I really liked me you might think you're right right now they're saying if you watch it now says she says you really liked me now\nOkay that's interesting when\nNo not when she was saying encyclopedia how you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on that last\nNight and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that third baby that they're they said something about their goal is to make a I don't know portal into another dimension\n... think demon into our yeah well they were doing St panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now and and mom it that they eat because we all know what he does you know the things he believes in any way\nThe other things that would reduce ... there'll be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because you know nightmares more\nUsually here's what I Want to use when I'm proposing the the the thing I mentioned to you about Islam and about Mandela about Mohammed\nIs that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was you know but then more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know the the thinking here it so I think I'm enjoying the fact is very interesting I think it's compelling um I'm Sorry I missed the show we run a great examples um I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this\nIt you can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew in Greek not from that era Hebrew enough that Iran Greek it's impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know ... people in ... the name of the person that was shocking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping approach them and putting a person's name in than others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nAnd so we have to quibble inform the thing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's when I'll be ... it up and I hope not politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who's in Tulsa and the time we have left on goes to goes day I'm Marty\nAnd the for the closure are monitored um first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I had to hit the

witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\nWho show have you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he\nWas not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had him scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nPreserving their actions and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and had contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in the near future that we would be able to opt load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you and\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here in right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran mosque or being very very involved well he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net of business is the really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that's because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman is now so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wraps itself around the brain and then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this known that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better but one of the one of the things that you know on mosque foreseen\nIs the day when we ... with the use of one of these are on that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a ... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nCaught um computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily uh hold you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very\nRealistic we can do about that tonight we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic second ... is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what'd you said to me it's been a I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know we ... we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea\nTo go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh\nNo absolutely and and you're right that this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies right are are kind of one foot in the presence and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about pie in the sky one you know the sweet bind by one day\nNo these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is and mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I Am reminded them\nOh it's it's crazy well in ... I'm reminded of the of the ... song\nUm which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men not ...\nAnd ... and the the the I think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being the based\nAnd ... and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the ox are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something on we do that and ... how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credited with their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it\nAnd then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this but\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I describe\nOur perfect face in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew I that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes that you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExpert in the wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and and finally um I met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it is so I have become a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my ... my faith very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets of faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book\nIs uh is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n[noise] about the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know\nLike whether that was through uploading brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for then what is the ultimate what's the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we become more\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and I think in another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say\nA I'm a help treat macular degeneration I Want to just pick that as an example there is a good way in California right there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration under eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policies so a lot of this technology that that ... aims at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of a society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um\nOr marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it in the\nWork taking it as a behind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes regular I Know you talk like that to the people they know you kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nWell I figured it's a late night show so\nI'm trying to get all your done on knowing that this\nLate but you know never mind ...

a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but\nAbout witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween\nAnd some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer the button scariest story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James who still have you better know as a sportswriter he writes he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he\nWas not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff up it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night on coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nPreserving their accents and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the teaching of the essence of a [noise] you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here in right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran must are being very very involved but you know he's involved in driverless cars evolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth\nCars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also got his finger in this whole neural net of business is the really the new one of the new hot topics out their\nImagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we're going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snatch so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosque it's foreseen is the day when we're ... with the use of one of these ... that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a\n... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning\nOf the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nCaught um computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can talk about that tonight we will I I think that's\nThe way to go not cryogenic that will ... is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what you said to me it's been a a\nI think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movie seriously\nThen we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea\nTo go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nDo you think you think yeah absolutely oh I\nKnow absolutely and and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city and to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies ... are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it in a naval us if\nYou will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about high in the sky want you know in the sweet bind by one day no these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about\nHey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I I'm reminded of the of the ... song a giant I inevitably come back to an subjects like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and ... and the the the I think\nThis is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by [noise]\nIt's about you're approaching this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based and and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book that even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can look because we should do and the officer really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing some things\nAren't we do that and ... how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide yep this is remember going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nThey said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you can a recording science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this but\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described\nAll fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series you know the facts ma'am right and so that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes if you can imagine\nOh no I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final\nChapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant\nAre a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise] what I think we need now because we are at this threshold of\nCreating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I have become a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion\nAncient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sense of faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think we need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like whether that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree\nIn ... we become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think on another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the\nTechnology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example\nThere's a link California right there's a company in California\nThat is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to who the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the waves this technology is shaping up right now\nIs for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um or marginalized by this technology will just get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and we're taking it in the\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use in that kind of\nI mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nWell I figured if the late night show so\nI'm trying to get all your done a melon okay asleep\nBut you know never mind ... I got to worry about my wife you know you either have to say what you said\nWas up but uh [laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling book out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape or this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers and a Google executives are and and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay but hang on to say listen I listen to ... percent because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints version I Know has a has that philosophies\nRight it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI I'm thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park\nWhen you said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them and then if that becomes the ... the clash that's perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance to do it has to there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting uh by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and\nWhen in fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party inject bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ...

it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\nYeah well you know what I'd been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to sew up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nUh by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure yeah you remember that a ... a sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at all my way way putting that much mechanical heart in a human being and you know within South Africa right and\nSo hard in a human being and the you know was in South Africa right and yeah exactly and\nAnd and and and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a we're even getting past mechanical heart hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota yeah I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but there you are\nNo you're right that the minute University of Minnesota's mustard for instantly do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why this gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called come era's shape human and pick human come air so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and sheep DNA or human DNA pick DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human heart for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature\nThat thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or pick I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility says it's not like you know made up ... pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this hostility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government is number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even an ice age it's kind of very um [noise] yeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button\nAnd decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nI'm sure I'm sure these guys are not just to get a violation of the agent probably doing it against the advice of their moms like what do you do yeah yeah they don't\nMind the oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up\nIn east LA and then ... says the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas\nAnd you know that stuff is explosive [laughter] but I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to see what happens is that the ... I was a little mad scientist in the area [laughter]\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say what are your thoughts on that already go play tiddlywinks or something safer\nVision Dalai ... as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I just thought I'd ever seen the ending\nFifteens any game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like thinking of pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you said the kind of work and so I don't know I I guess I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it was happening right now still lose two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on\nIt so All right so the the island of Dr ... pretty scary it really is but I I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're ... you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look on the windows Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know the Google Books by me soon you know by me some more attend meet whatever in these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of the ... and I kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downside of having a my\nIt's just beginning to learn the downside of having a microphone connected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things\nTo worry about and that's yeah I think we're bringing about our cell okay you're a ... if\nYou're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa buy me like you know there's a doll house fancy fancy dollhouse and parents are totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... and now are you\n... you mean by that take away I mean you know leaders of [laughter] yeah I Know it's\nSo big he's rather in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple wash and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the little series whenever there and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening\nThat is going on now we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationship [noise] uh for our communities\nAnd for the security of our ... a country I've just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so I think that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThe anger that kind of a ... year refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now are more than eight billion\nInternet uh of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou're talking about the show the thing in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHi Michael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we 'cause I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the least looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the Austin\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspect of our ally that can tell you when you're at sleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix ... they they download what you're watching when out for a long I mean\nThere ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I liked till a lot of them I mean I were an apple watched by the way they used that as a plot\nLot of them I mean I I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week [laughter] exact same\nThing similar took it from the real life oh they do maybe they always do ya know\nRipped from Janine did lead to the uh but that's where I mean I I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing people listen to all good they kind of killer because of the ...\nThe hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system which accidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime\nI mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test\nOf this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRun a that they've got you covered in the ... yeah\nAnd and and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRunning with which raises the possibility that\nYou and I can have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their data base but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know that let's get you keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly\nGood a night on my own turned back up\nThere you go and get a question from Michael yes Michael and I heard you are speaking about the\nAh drive a cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there's a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but a great to have them on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things I'm One of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine and Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some ... years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that it's never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically a ... or whatever it was\n... right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions said he was able to sit on his mind\nAnd later I got to get\nYou a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called that sounds more like the the did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah um I'll watch wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to that because I knew there were ... we had our time is pressures and I open lines is where that kind of belong\nSo let me go to a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\n... Michael I got one question for you here where does in an whereas a wind we stopped playing God\nOr are we have we that's a good question but are we blamed on yet and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael [noise]\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and ah you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology\nAnd I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to trace is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is what we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your your your picket imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one thinker that\nCan read it with him right there but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease\nIf the disease is natural it was as God made it natural in your instance hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid that phrase although I Know it's a popular place for it right and\nThat's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... ... ... what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift\nThe oilfields on fire oh totally I what I was the first\nTelevision correspond to actually find my way to those oil ill or ... or a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get their ... through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian oil company he knew our way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of traces question is\nI see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mine that's going to do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous nevermind a great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I I say all it takes\nFor us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nOkay Mississippi thing I think that will be the end if it if it comes that way and now I Am committed\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics let me just give you\nWhen we hear about people dying of curable and preventable diseases we might find ourselves saying someone should do something about that who is doing something about that the answer is project hope for over fifty years project hope has been making hope happened\nIn poverty zones around the world by preventing disease promoting wellness and saving lives one child one family at a time to volunteer or learn more about all the great work that project hope is doing this a project hope dot org slash make hope happen\nIf you're looking for new portable way to blow your business called camera and we'll have one of our marketing consultants contact you there's no obligation just an opportunity to see how we can provide you with the type of results we've been deliberately do our clients throughout the tri-state area\nFor years pole cameras nine to eight seven six three\nFifty five eighty six nine to eight seven six three fifty five eighty six let's grow your business together\n[noise]\nGetting all last just before got him caught I'm Jane ...

garbage out buddy you know\nA very interesting things I hadn't heard that about a Alaska Alex's but and that's how they programmed her to to say that this is of course wrong and and not accurate I'm not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people\nWho are atheists who studied the subject come to the conclusion by and large that he was a historical figure a as was Muhammad but that that's crazy and I hope they say that I that sounds like something that they would lose Silicon Valley though doesn't it\nUh let me go to um marry who's in New Jersey on ... because I Am married\nAround how are you today I'm going back to your guest\nUm I don't get caught in a I can break that\nWell that's a great question the ghost in the machine\n[laughter] like a robot looks like that [laughter]\nYeah I that's an interesting idea I I Would think possession\nYou know generally we talk about possession of the soul so is it if it's just a ... a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul than it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that a inanimate objects you know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach mints\nPlace for you know a spirit just from that will are unwilling to leave an area and so they become attached to a thing\nSo maybe not in Seoul is we would say like there's an in filament possession but\nWho knows you know that's what led coast to coast you all are always bringing up the never thought to Paula is in Omaha on coast to coast go ahead Paula\nYeah I'm a I remember when\nYou're on your um what was my drama\nUm [noise] yeah\nOh yeah it was like now I'm telling my tonight yeah when I began\nAnyway anyway um there are people out there that are in English or they're really loud and I really really really right and\nI think you have any right when our al ...\nCame out two weeks I just want ... [noise] and I I I and I ... on Saturday when I get\nOur oil yeah some day in Kenya paid ... ... ...\nPeople that are so it's so wonderful world literature and it just kills in or what or I think you're one\nWell you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I\nI think it you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost their breath over then we just cut us off guard so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think you have you lived in Ohio with\nThat and\nI think I think you have any leaves highway at\n... and that this is they are quick my father it's upright cast came here oh cool toy and I grew up and I you know\nI grew up around radio stations trans ... yeah\n[laughter]\nI never did that start track that oh I have a net and get\nPaid but I just if you're a kid\nThey say oh my God it's a\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly um so what kind of see what station did your father worked for a\nWhile he don't Cape deal and and ... and they were where oh wow\nI Know thank you so much censorship is I was like oh here I think you God Bless you have a great night\nI I've always worked I'm not that ... advance I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love the engineers would really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they could just builds up and down to nothing I'm All right so that brings me to oh keys from Virginia is back so he had called the um when we were talking with our gas last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have money for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back so you you had a friend who it was ... you were telling your story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experienced declined is almost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely\nDelivered where he suddenly knew exactly what you do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and uh that individual by the way and and ah thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker smoother with everything but um somebody very topics for either ... and and they related defended the things I wanted to say too but this\nGentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he relate to the experience of a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a visited him from the spirit world and delivered a message for him to give to their parents\nSo anyway this individual by the way is the same rough on them now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been an apostle for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left his world renowned medical career a became president of a church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things in which\nThings revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and hiding from time to time I hear things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link about\nParanormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find in also in the Bible and and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to hand I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other this or that he had\nProfits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYeah and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds ... go ahead so\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman naps and there's a very good\nYoutube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles seem to have\nBeen lost by you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures had been boss that were the basis of the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out um\nThat way they\nWant to do the correct we end up in a jar container so they're all out towards or it can get through it would it have their own man right there\nYeah the ... of the the moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um\nIn it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors and depends on the ... and this little cup holder whose district moving around and it's just it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar\nWas on a slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent ... guy so I'll go with that until they've got\nAnd the other theory to a a back it up Michelle is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nOh wow I I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver and I like all\nThe first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but up easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second okay I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have\nWhat I was wondering why it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and for other options and other things out there because\nYou know I just I don't know that that's the way I felt inside an restroom hair gas Michael I'm closer to when you first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nThe fact that I sat at later\nTell them to read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't have a very strong with religious stuff exactly but I'm a little bit\nLike I ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how I can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the fried and the story of a you know like a [noise]\nI said there are a hero type figure being one of a virgin and stuff those stories can be found in like ... that the call ... ... ... it's hard for like ... and that alone in whatever creates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the\nYou're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narrative should the news story [noise]\nUm and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me always is not this to me\nAnd this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true that\nWe know to be a worth steering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know and so there are a lot of these stories to tell the truth the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be on survivor\nThey'll let you know stories that can be found in other places we can still try to find like the other information on the bottom\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr ... other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't that in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it's do you can you do live your life better\nDoes it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science [noise] there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be in the book and it's not I don't think I'm ... and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nOkay let me think of that let's my best answer for you hope it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nIn a long time out here to things fell good good will be\nAnd in a long time not here to thanks foul [laughter] good\nWill be ... be a you know you're a bad man the gym and you get what you're going well and\nThank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad your was your first time I got to be there with\nYou um I go to a adjusted who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey it's nice to be on a list them wherever they were actually call them or have you had to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want you to some more scientific stuff yeah\nSure I'm not sure if a lot of people call the alarmed mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I smoked ...\nYeah they're they're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is a good night logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a A R I and a thriving addict augmentation and stuff and uh\nI really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability to do these massive computations and access to any kind of data that we that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh\nYou know what would that do maybe to the educational system where we go to school would be just take a loss of classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of this no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be ... ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nHave you know if the fine arts credit that people just take\nThe right because it gives it and if it's not that a dance you know or something so I dance and philosopher you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in uh in his technological ... solutions on big big unseen ability\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview was troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nYou know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must cause some big giant slot machine yeah\nSomeday against the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I own\nGeniuses are you know I and then everybody that that's a very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly\nIn a day or something like that won't affect stock\nWell I don't know that though because I see my argument would be that ... we I invested in ... mosque mhm right I did in ... I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minutes interview\nHis dentures that as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better and make a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels\nCome off right I'm watching was we'll start going ... and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I'm I I think any time the head of a company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they lived their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree with you use its own genius\nI think he exposed himself a little more on it and put on public but I mean I think the\nProcess that everything is pretty consistent whether he was and he read it or\nNot he claims\nThat that's a that's a very soon future you know ... it was based in June of Nineteen you know what I mean right not that good but right were mentally getting more technical logically advanced

you've got a cooler flushing question for us today\nYes I Want to find out a lot of garages not believe that you only green the radiator in in a cooling OK okay is that the right way of doing it with the old fashioned way of flushing it up\nThere's two different ways of doing a shift in your case you have a vehicle that's a ... six years old now and eighty thousand out a bunch of miles but they do recommend every five years or a hundred and fifty thousand miles\nMost shops will have a test strip a like a like you're getting a test swimming pool water that'll show the acidity of the ... and that's up to their discretion if it comes down to the point where\nColin and that's up to their discretion if it comes down to the point where it's good meaning below the acidic levels\nA lot of them would just like to do the drain and fill you know they're drained radiator as much as they can and then they'll put the appropriate mix back in but if the city level level is higher\nThan they will do it it's not really I Want to call it a flush it is but it's more of an exchange of anything we're pushes out the old in polls in the new\nUh the only exception to that too is what they'll do individually when they do it flushes they'll use a different different type of ah flushing procedure to do the heater core but the key here is checking to see what a city the levels that you already have in the ... so you know that's\nYou know if you if you'd prefer to have done that way you know a a true flush uh entails removing the thermostat so you're going to pay a lot more money doing it that way and some people would rather say you know I don't want to do it let's just say at least to the exchange but it's all based on what they see what's with the test strips\nNo they called me the reason for that if the if you give a ... and that will come and then you might have\nReal no no that's that's not correct I mean you ... anybody any ... any professional what they should tell your number one is you know they'll check at first you know eighty thousand miles you know the the recommendation is five years or a hundred and fifty thousand miles you should do it\nBut that doesn't necessarily until a total flush it depends on the vehicle and how the vehicle was a cared for\nAnd if you have you know that would be like saying uh you know the cars a year old is can flush to complete system it's not required it's not necessary so I Would not say you have any residue or any contaminants in the system if you take test strips and check out that the the systems at a hundred percent then you can just do a drain and fill\nAll right through very good Joe thanks for the call let's go now to John John has a a Ninety seven forty explorer John how many miles on your Ford\nI'll only have three hundred and six thousand\nMiles [laughter] good for you but the city you're calling about a slipping clutch\nYeah this thing and then I just got this clutch ... done because you know it was toast they looked at it was bad but [noise] so I had it for a while\nHad parked in a not a steep driveway but a decent size you know a little Anglo driveway I don't have a a I don't have a functional parking brake and the first thing I Want to ask you in that case are you supposed to lead the vehicle and reverse or in a different here if you are\nEither first or reverse naturally if you're on an incline you have the wheels turn to like have you back into a curb a and a few started off with a ... you have a brand new collection of vehicle now\nYeah I just got it in or out okay weeks ago\nYeah your great reverse or first gear always because if you keep it in a higher gear yes it can roll\nOkay this is the problem now now the vehicle is rolling on me it's like it's like it's losing its grip\nAnd they get scripts losing its grip and it just happened that day or so ago right okay\nIn the vehicle drives fine on the road I get good grip everything else like that what could this things\nWell here's what you need to do put it on a level surface right place the vehicle and first gear okay or second your choice make sure the key is out of the ignition\nYou don't want you to rock the vehicle back and forth and see if you can get it to move\nOkay now if you say it's slipping slipping slipping it's due to the fact that you may be on a very steep incline and that's not probably uncommon for that to happen because of the weight of the vehicle if it's more than Fifteen degree inclined your best to have that parking brake replaced or make sure you have a couple of we'll show us trucks with you to keep on hand\nBecause they're just started happening\nYeah do that as a task then then you'll know okay and if the end of the vehicle does move when vendors are good possibility that maybe the pressure plate failed the pressure plates today on that vehicle are going to have they are going to be a diaphragm type pressure plate where it's going to have will say like twenty five little fingers\nRight there in groups there's maybe three or four plates that are that are like riveted together to go around\nIf one of the plates gave way even though it's brand new which still can break than\nThat it does that mean that they replaced the pressure plate or well well\nI don't know what you paid for you know you should have had\nPain about seven hundred dollars\nYeah you should have had a disk you should have had the pressure plate or I don't know if they reach surface to fly will for years sometimes are going to recommend replacing the hydraulic a slave cylinder which is\nPart of it that they said that that was a problem so I got a brand new ... um what they call it swayed so yes I\nGot that replaced also\nOkay yeah but that could do this for a test first any vehicle that has a manual transmission should have an operational parking brake yeah so [laughter]\nI don't have that but you were you taught me to do is the park and put it in first year scared yep and then ...\nThe pocket or the first year or scared\nAnd then rocks vehicle if you could push the vehicle without you know make sure the keys to the ignition rice right and if you have a hard time moving it than we know for a fact that it's it's not the Koch will be the incline and then you have this it losers in issue there\nSo that's not unusual for this thing on an incline\nOh no oh no no let me I I'm a much what it costs for him to get the parking brake I mean well gee tens normally used to what happens on the vehicles that the real breaks you lose themselves the patch or talks if you want to call it that will separate from\nThe shoes so you've got the costs that she was sadly enough now to lift a vehicle he'll probably end up spending quite a bit of money though that's probably replace both parking brake cables all the hardware all the points and then issues it may cost up to let's say three hundred dollars or something you can do themselves as he is good and I'm\nNot really okay especially if it's been awhile since you had a rubber aches put on it or rotors could be seized and spend those\nIt may take a little bit of time already Okay John appreciate the have a great day thanks for calling us You're on the car show let's go now to a ... and how has it two thousand Volkswagen Jana how how many miles on your agenda\n\nAlright or six miles very good and uh so yeah I Love that conversion the or the car as critical problem what's going on\nI Know a pretty oh\nReally [noise] sure\nWe're all like I said\nOkay all so\nI actually I should say well here's which [noise] sure [noise]\nRight and we're going to run out of the time so what you need to do it's definitely still in that area the wiggle test is not really that good if the fires are already broken\nIn your case if the mirrors aren't working and there are other components not working then you do have some wires that are broken in that area so what you need to do is look at that rubber conduit between the door in the door post\nA if it's a difficult difficult want to get at sometimes you have to take a single ... razor blade and slice it for inspection but you you will definitely find one or two broken wires it's not an uncommon problem for that to happen on your vehicle\nSo forget the will to write broken unless you're gonna should Iran right and it's it's over ... if it's not working it's confined to the door then it's definitely broken waters alright so very good hour we're going to take a break\nWhen we come back we're going to talk to fill up about in
