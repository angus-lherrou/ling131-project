know violence could go down but if you look at what's going on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nNow loom the title of your new book the power of he has to do with the number of people you put in the ... the why me why not three earn Fifteen\n[laughter] we'll tell vague really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups of you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel\nAnd so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really\nDone many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's what I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young\nSo um so I\nI don't care around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just\nPut people in groups of eight and or so and hasn't sent healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eight so it came about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop\nFirst one we ran in Chicago\nI always kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I've looked at what worked in scientific in the scientific lab\nBut I wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands when Jimmy do so and I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured I'd have them come back the next day and tell us what happened and I had all the groups send intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge and when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's\nIt's kind of like having a facial or getting back rub do you know nice little feel good effect that isn't what happened what happened is stuff like this they lined up I gave them the Mike in turn and they said things like\nI have cataracts and their eighty percent better do for a new replacement my knees\nThe percent better I'm due for a knee replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today\nAnd I can do deep squats\nI have terrible insomnia and I slept like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that\nTotal instant healing and I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things as a journalist I look at things I Try to look at the science of things that try to prove things\nAnd this was completely out of my realm so I didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a placebo effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things and I've had people where their\nTheir arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody was skull yo says who went completely out of pain and we then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight in so much they had to change the rearview mirror for car\nStories like this over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the centers to and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo tell me about the show how how powerful much navy and then what was happening\nWell their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of the George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it and we don't realize it amplifies in a group [noise]\nLet me tell you about the story of Wes and Wes when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just this kind of\nJust as a test this was last last saw them last last fall and um I west wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups um because he suffered from terrible depression but\nThere was a woman there with stage four cancer Linda and so we\nWe decided to go with her but when I had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got cold and he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with drafted for ... for college um college students so we had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed and that continued in his life he even even lost the love of his life to fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he\nHe got to meeting me he had gotten to a point of feeling like what's the use and he was living in a senior facility\nYou barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda\n[noise] and then that the next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was almost like you had this amazing heightened to sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been he drank a cup of herbal tea and knock the socks\nOff he says um but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision and almost a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd this than Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and\nThat experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is how we're walking Ninety minutes sees lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church he's writing he's trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder\nUm and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that act of being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows the sons or need to have any special abilities\nWell here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWill reach a skeptic 'em all skeptics\nWas I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this manifestation law attraction I didn't\nI wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know we talking about the shifting\nTo find out how far can you take it you know we're talking about the shifting a quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here so um that was set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life universities the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of power fake to let their neural science department look at this\nSo we set up a group of students\nAnd we put a age it kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the group and\nWhat we found was so amazing that within a few minutes they would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate\nAnd also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity so these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctor said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at other things like\nUh the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk horror sci fi master sure my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation\nAnd all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nWas to do when we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk

should me seeing how ... works and doesn't take much effort to make things happen\nWill that was the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before they have to be eight no five all work\nEleven or work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nI'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week\nAnd that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health you know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives\nOr you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but at pretty much everybody\nHad extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works uh primarily from the field or is or science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwave study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer\nBecause you have these major changes\nWhich are really very\nVery much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences\nAnd they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know something major his change all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nThey believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is it a group of fact\nAmy I'm trying to figure out what is it is it a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects and when I started looking into um\nThe science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd that's what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group and twenty fifty and then I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman cold Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else\nAnd she was one of the people who was intending for the young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so\nCan I tell you any everything about how this works\nYou're absolutely not [laughter] there's complete X factor here I don't understand\nBut there is something about that power of getting off for
