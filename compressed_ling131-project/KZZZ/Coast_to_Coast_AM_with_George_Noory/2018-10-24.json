I got to tell you the Denisovans not just having property it's we're in is in the course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly one where they are because it's the holy land it's it's where\nJesus and everything else began to them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's

that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nThe state of Israel was um was created the Israelis DNA dictates that the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point

any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nAnd keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure a good question Brian uh answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a shop\nOr they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAnticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromised their uh they had to shut down safe houses uh where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that\nUh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat have access to everything\nThe CIA point man and Lebanon that have access to everything\nOr what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say a B Russian KGB at the time [noise] so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so a was a operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see

beginning a truly was killed at the consulate butchered uh I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia or but geez my gosh what's your take\nOn that [noise] my goodness\nGeez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness Georgia I can never remember another incident like that on a\nDiplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of some bodies via similar methods that we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates a\nAnd the arena but uh I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put\nPut together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility uh with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a much better operation and and so uh either it was done with the purposeful intent is to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this is a based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then\nA few other a Saudi princes that have disappeared too so um\nSince since the since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to ah Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh\nUh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of royals away at the rich Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos uh there's still an intelligence provider\nNo that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are a few\nTimes that I'm a ... sad to say and it's just the nature of the business uh you know some\nOf rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like with our five eyes relationships um but you know those stone at times work as smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services so that's the one monitor or that you learn and and basic agent school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services and then each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\nAnd you're more cars Yogi apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer ... uh the ... you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event\nOr this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe ... more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know was at one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe\nPaul when ... you know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do\nDo these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to ...\nWell ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish prison that's that's the one given\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx slips going to start a Tom go ahead\nYes I like to say that the latest a horrendous caper is Yemen\nI mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name and how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians\nWhen they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well

some ape out there in the woods we want to believe that you will ... come from other planetary systems and it's not just some\n... nature throwing a plasma balls or anything like that or if we want to believe that there's an afterlife and goes to the real thing we really get disappointed when I you know the reality of some of these things pops up\nAnd you realize well this was just a natural occurrence or or\nYou know some kind of electrical discharge and the clouds or whatever it was\nIt gets to be disappointing doesn't it\nShould because then you know once you get it it it makes the outlook the illusion of life young seem ordinary in a way you know that that\nBut they can't be an explanation for everything that's the way I I kind of look at it you know that there are the things that happen out there and you certainly a big pot of all kinds of different just strange things ah people see things and you know they all can't be making up they can't be hoaxes\nOr we have it's the book where you know hundreds of people out of the people for a different kind of paranormal type stuff so that has to be something behind it maybe it's all tied together you know I'm Talking about this on the show like that maybe big putting goes in UFOs Loch Ness monster all the whole thing\nAll comes from the same thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about that a lot\nUm but it's it's an endless fascination with us in with a lot of people\nWell and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making these stories that they she goes to new lows and big foot you've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very under usual and that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\n... ... it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda molten how who's a reporter Mac\nOr she's an expert in crops formations\nAnd a truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources of the man and whatever those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us\nWhatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way and I told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one ... is the unusual one it's amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nCan absolutely for sure and I are like Argo story you know if you could talk to if there's one person always come back here from the afterlife that's it was amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the u._s. soldiers is a little boy were you raised religious Mac because it was a photo of questions and that\nThat really you know I I grew up in digester which was the kind of working class out of

know\nWhen you were you alter when Alberta solve all the Boston stringer was out there doing his thing\nSame neighborhood I'm Sorry to say but\nYeah I thought so I thought what an amazing story that was sure\nYeah it wasn't he a family man\nA well he had a ... kind of a not a drifter but you know he um he never really held a lot of stable job then you know there's a lot of people think that he didn't do it that he was actually framed by the cough because they needed somebody to um\nYou know to to arrest and because there was I can remember does it you know it was the headlines all the time\nThe time you know this guy ... a lot of women right in in our little area and um you know there was some stuff that he didn't know about some of them are undecided but who knows but one once he went to jail\nStuff that he didn't know about some of them are undecided but who knows but when once you went to jail they did stop so\nYeah they did stop and there could have been a few copycats object to it that is true they're always on the lookout for those how did you accumulate\nThe stories for hunted universe how did you get them\nWell uh you know once again had boxes of all this different research in that for a while I worked very tore up website those out of a true TV TBS\nAha okay now they just decide me to go five Fifteen odd stories a month and that just you know I bought lots of books on line and so on and just accumulated office filed ... strange stories\nAre you still finding new storage Mac\nAll the time yeah uh-huh I'm sure\nThey don't stop and I'm sure you've got

and I'm sure you've got your own favorites don't you\nOh I sure do yeah uh-huh\nAnd unusual once I get a lot of strange calls to the radio program ah there was one where a police officer cold\nAnd he said that they had a cold that there was a heart attack victim in the house and they got there before the EMTs he and his partner\nAnd they get to the door and the little man opens the door to let them in and they go rushing in and they see on the floor the body of another old man they pulled him over they turn him over right because he's on his stomach they ruined them over and it's a little man let them in\nA while they turn around and that guy is gone and there he is dead on the floor\nStories like that makes you think wow what's going on\nI got a call from an EMT who was on the scene of an accident and she was a she was not working so she stopped her own car got out when running saw the body and the side of the road\nUm was looking at the body sees somebody standing by her car and said please call nine one one it was the guy that died\n[noise] wow wow yeah and they I mean you can't make that stuff up\nYeah right we did a story in the book record someone who called a a real estate company asking that it has to be sold and when the real estate company looked into it they actually got a person's life and it turns out that you know it it just passed away\nAt all but his wife sell the house and it's amazing how do you get your most of them\nLeft a message on a message machine which was you know\nThat's where they they seem to like electronics\nRight they do yeah I've

Malone he's haunted universe let's get into some of these stories Mac if we can tell us about the ... bully disappearance right\nYet luckily that's apparently a very strange story first story in the book uh back in World War one the British British soldiers also with a lot of Australia New Zealand soldiers\nInvaded a pot of turkey turkey was an ally of Germany show\nThey said that invasion force down the turkey they land at this stage for the just really get stuck on the beach and it was just really horrible just a ... there were a lot of spotted in World War one but this was like just a really really\nBut a lot of spiders and World War one but this was like just a really really a massive wanted um Mel Gibson sat in a movie\nCalled go locally and if you see that you know it's just heartbreaking how all these people died there well anyway there was a um\nA company of a hundred soldiers called the ... and they were actually made up of service from a large state in England and they have trained together they went over to um a fight the Germans together and they were part of this invasion\nAnd really all it was was just a troops just marching into a murderous a machine gun fire anyway this company of soldiers British soldiers just went into the smoke\nAnd would never seen again a dead\nBodies were never recovered ... um they um during this part of what they did and you know sometimes take these truce was where they would let people either both sides take their dead and wounded off the battlefield but no one ever found the bodies of these a\nHundred guys and even the person who was in charge of the British commander in chief said you know he he could never figure out exactly what happened\n... what do you think\nI don't know who knows you know it's ... it's just very unusual that none of these none of the soldiers from this particular unit the ones getting their bodies were never found no remains fond of them are they literally disappeared during a major battle\nWe've got a guess named David the ladies max that has written a book called machine for one one several other books after that were people disappear in our park systems never to be seen in many cases some of them right some of them they do find their bodies but they're very strange circumstances but\nI'm I'm sometimes wonder if there's some kind of dimension or Portugal or something that people stumble through and they're gone\nOr something I I Know in some of those four one one stories and national parks you know people that to people like jogging and one goes round the bend and then they never see 'em again you know it it it's almost something that happens immediately a very scary very interesting stories as well\nA little situation or just a month ago with the little boys from Louisiana who his father's I mean a little kid and he ran away and he couldn't keep up with them and they found the kid the civil days later you know dead by Greek I mean just strange stories yeah really\nYeah yeah pretty what am I on England's phantom Tom what's now\nWhile this was one you know we we really kind of had to look into this one because I'm the areas of up until a few years ago if you went on a go go off you looked at any kind of a phone book or whatever and I'm\nWest blanket ... England area ah you saw that there was a town there are called ...\nI had everything out of ... post office and had its own newspaper and you know had a job section real estate company there's even a dating service there but it turns out that this this time never existed um anyone who went to the land cotton and given to\nYou on a Google Map they would just find an empty field I'm no one really knows exactly what happened a one newspaper said that Google and the people who supplied mapping data you know unable to explain you know why they have this town on their maps but when you actually go to the place\nIt's not there so when the book you know we ... we we really can't you know figure out what is going on there and you know there's no UFO activity near the place a military activity to one person published a what better place for government to hide secrets then at that time that never existed\nUm it seems to be some kind of um drill or some kind of how to you know for some reason maybe some intelligence services want to know what it's like to create a phantom time well they did it in the middle of England\nThat's weird isn't it yeah it sure is in a\nStrange stories like that all the time you were talking about your photos and that you've never seen one that I saw a couple with night vision goggles in your opinion based on your research were some of the best places in the United states to spot UFOs\nUh-huh well you know it's funny I'm there there's let's say a top three or four but one of them is a place called elk river Minnesota\nAnd there's nothing really you know extraordinary about this a place except uh starting a few years ago people started seeing UFOs almost on a daily or let's say a nightly basis\nAnd uh it's just a small community it's it's no more friends fishing and and and I'm\nA scheme men are than anything else but what's strange about it is not only do people see UFOs frequently there but they're not your typical UFO some of them look like a one person said that\nUh they saw one that you know it looked like a huge jellyfish or others look like you know just very lied you reach a some of the sites\nLook like you know just very lied you reach a some of the size of ... some of them are you know small was basketball's but for whatever reason is they want to congregate around a little elk river Minnesota that's one place\nOr another interesting places Stephenville, Texas which is down near where\nA judge W Bush's ranch is and there was a major citing down there years ago and in two thousand\nI ate where some people saw\nA a UFO being chased by sixteen fighters or air force fight as other people saw a large UFO being escorted by F. sixteen fighters and it happened right near where a judge Bush's ranchers and apparently you know down in that part of Texas\nIf you keep your eyes open and go out at night and maybe get those night vision goggles you could see lots of different things\nHis ranch in anything to do with whether you know\nI I I don't know you know I think the whole idea that some of the witnesses and they had a lot of witnesses and um some of the thought that the outsiders were chasing the UFO but then other people swear they that they saw them playing alongside of like they're escorting um and just the fact that it was near his ranch\nOr who knows but um yeah that's that's ... ... it's still today as a place where if you want to take the time to get down there are people see you all falls on a regular basis Gulf breeze Florida which had a um a controversy many years ago\nWhere a guy named Edwin ... came up with lots of photographs very detail photograph ... story reached right and\nAnd and then you know I have some people went to great lengths to prove a in their minds any way that you know these were hoaxes but the strange thing is is that people still get down there and people still see odd things in the sky and they still take pictures of them still detail than almost look like the ones that are at Walters had so\nUm what's whatever's flying around up there you know there's a good chance you're going to see it if you get out of Gulf breeze\nWhat's your best celebrity

and\nAll kinds of very very odd stories people going in with with a um you know a terminal diseases coming out and about the strange thing about this place is that in in the story that really gets me is that uh once they started letting people in Russian journalist and there was this gentleman or who\nHad been in the army and the washed out of the ... because of a\nA medical reasons he kind of bounced around in Moscow for a while and then he uh caught on as a journalist and got at the time to go into the I'm trying now at this guy once again he he didn't go to anything like a college or

of this planet\nWon't be able to handle the truth that there may be you know being from other worlds are out there and maybe visiting us I Know the ... Winston Churchill during World War two someone gave him a very detailed photograph of what they called foo fighters back down but the UFOs\nAs he did not want that released to the public released yeah that's right because he he thought all religion would fail that that was his reason\nThat you know while religion is based on earth based in if we find out that you know we're not the only ones in the universe to put some new questions on um a lot of the major religions so you know can we not handle that I don't believe that I think there are the vast majority of people on this earth\nWant to know what's going on and want would like to know that there are other being's out there you know it's one thing at once again it would be like the greatest story it in and all of history why they keep it from us though that's just if they know what these things are and they're keeping that uh information from us\nAnd that's that's a crime of not just the ... century but of climate history why should they know when we do\nWell you know as David Jacobs believes Mac could be something very serious going on here\nQuickly you know uh we had a guest on that show the other night and he was someone who uh works for the MCI yes and that in fact his office actually give story ideas to the TV show\nAnd I'm of the blue he said yeah we asked him what he thought of um just UFOs in general what he'd have seen what he's seen as travels and and I said well you know as soon as I heard\nIn his travels and and I said well you know as soon as I heard this idea of being around about the space for us\nNot maybe this was something that we have\nPut together very quickly you know for some reason that bike be an affair yes ah\nThe central characters out there let's say\nLet's go to Terry in Modesto, California Hi Jerry go ahead\n... yes sixty years ago I did tell like type ...

geo political intelligence for him and he's one of the world's foremost experts on security\nTerrorists in terrorist organizations he's the former State Department counterterrorism deputy chief DSS agent and the author of a best selling memoir ghost confessions of a counter terrorism agent didn't chasing shadows here's Fred first of all Fred welcome to the program looking forward to this\nThank you for having me on again George ... spent about seven\nYears since you were a lesson with us but I'm Glad you're back Samuel Katz is a New York times best selling author and an internationally recognized terrorism law enforcement in ...\nAnd then the internationally recognized terrorism law enforcement in military special operations expert is written more than twenty blocks in hundreds of articles in the ear and Israeli conflict international counterterrorism military law enforcement special ops\nAnd Palestinian and Islamic fundamentalists tour as well Samuel welcome to to the program\nThank you so much for having me and their book is called Beirut rules the murder of a CIA station chief and his role as war against America a friend in San ... a Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown country now be ... used to be the jewel of the middle east there isn't any more Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong and country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd how long Samuel has this been going on with the Rand backing Hezbollah in who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God it is a Shiite religious militia um\nUnderground rainy and proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiites populations for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leaders of murder to Libya and left the vacuum in the country and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... the Iranians for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the salaries that they send 'em intelligence specialists and they sent revolutionary guards and\nTo live and on with Syria's blessing and they set up they live and on and they established almost the mini state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nIn front of the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists the crime in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere I'm fairly the the two people of the two groups that neglected is this a rifle and the amount of money at the amount of influence with uranium through spreading as well get on\nWith the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFriend is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of just some history a\nThis it never been done this was an organization that had a literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and um but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find a bill who certainly was an American hero\nAnd you get into that story or want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty ... heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\nThey each why do I have to even worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of\nNine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nA and a a take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley here and just a moment we're with Fred Britain Samuel Katz the book is called the babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Samuel with your book be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um\nThe has the forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep I'm president of off of um regime in power um has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period we're afraid of him I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalists suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged and to probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm is it is for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to fill up there um I ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm In two thousand ... launched\nA um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has if we ... them operatives in this country\nHe's has for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran if I'm a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important to us national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we work with the Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets either they're\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting talk with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them well we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive about engaging Iran militarily some\nAre hostages were seized at the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war with Iran and Hezbollah against the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of the marine barracks which was um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nOut on hold on for a second set and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you and friend as well about your book be rude rules next on the coast to coast am\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast for Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules\nSam you were mentioning of course that a Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated no I don't\nThink so I think um we haven't gone after Iran I literally because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with the wrong might bring I think the Iranian youth groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners\nI think the Iranian use of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombings against and to see the\nMarines and the kidnapping of\nA serious station chief from things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station chief from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Britain tell us about what you Buckley\n[noise] ah there was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I've done and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and\nA thought about cashing them but I'm a bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar we're lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a\nElderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nUm and he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea as a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart um and which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into other when he comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nOr as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things\nWhen you know didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history [noise]\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty he uh he joins or the U.S army again er and goes under special forces\nAre and um and it's also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and um they'll goes off or to Vietnam and\nWhere he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYou know for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um\nAnd and off the bill uh was uh uh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so\nUh that was his belt buckle was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine war was a pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so a bill is not a and a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um it you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple of vehicles\nHe's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around there\nThat's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ...\nUh where you had a whole ... professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt was an entourage so ah the nature of the job and that and that time period was ah you were a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out or who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... ... visas button Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died\nAnd that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because we had voted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise]\nUh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack rental\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was not time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nI'm ... and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran\nA and another time actually held\nInside the

special guest for your let me introduce them first Fred Burton Fred as a vice president of intelligence and counterterrorism at the Stratford that leading geo political intelligence for him and he's one of the world's foremost experts on security\nTerrorists in terrorist organizations he's a former State Department counterterrorism deputy chief DSS agent and the author of a best selling memoir ghost confessions of a counter terrorism agent and chasing shadows here's Fred first of all Fred welcome to the program looking forward to this\nThank you for having me on again George ... spent about

special operations expert is written more than twenty bucks in hundreds of articles in the Arab Israeli conflict international counterterrorism military and law enforcement special ops\nAnd Palestinian and Islamic fundamentalists tour as well Samuel welcome to to the program\nThank you so much for having me and their book is called\nBeirut rules the murder of a CIA station chief\nAnd their book is called Babe Ruth rules the murder of a Shiite each station chief in his bowl as war against America a friend in San ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that tore blown the country now be ... used to be the jewel of the middle east there isn't any more Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong in country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd uh how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah in who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God it is a Shiite religious militia um\nUnderground Iranian proxy groups that were formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiites populations for domination of the country and the sheer were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leaders was murdered in Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and base of the uranium for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent the and the salaries that they send some intelligence specialist somebody sent revolutionary guards men\nTo Lebanon with serious blessing and they set up based in Lebanon and they established almost the mini state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nInside the country I'm for them I interviewed a few people who are journalists at the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere I'm fairly the the two people of the two groups that neglected is this a rifle and the amount of\nMoney and the amount of influence with the Iranians were spreading of Lebanon where the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFriend is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as el ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which\nUh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of parts of history\nThat's never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUm we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a heck of a heck of a lot of us that that's certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nAnd you get into that story you want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid ... what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nOn the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region why we need a footprint uh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nIt's on us soil and that's the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley here in just a moment we're with Fred Burton Samuel Katz their book is called Babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Sam you're with your book be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there and if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um\nThe has the forces have been fighting from the onset along fried rainy and special forces to help keep I'm president of off of um regime in power has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties the period we're afraid and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalist suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged and to probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states in Iraq\nIt was um it was absolutely a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq to fill up there I'm ... I'm strategy and tactics that killed so many American servicemen I'm into ... launched\nA I'm a horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism is one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has its Weaver cells and operatives in this country\nHas for many years and it is an arm and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important the U.S national interest\nAll countries of course work through straw parties we worked with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting tough with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're gonna ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive\nAbout engaging Iran militarily or hostages were seized with the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran has like in\nThe United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of the second the end of the the bombing of the marine barracks which was um thirty five years ago to this they hold on\nHold on for a second sand will come back to this point and we'll talk with you and Fred as well about your book be rude rules next on the coast to coast they\nNever missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to go see 'em dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nPan welcome back to coast to coast red Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called the rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after you were on militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the reigning you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombing of empathy Murray and\n... and the kidnapping\nOf a station chief from things that was unheard of in the world is being pushed up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only fish is she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered\nIn the history of the agency for Britain\nOr kidnapped and murdered in the history of the agency\nFor Burton tell us about when you bought me\nA bill was a a a true patriot Georgia he grew up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there is actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA ... and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them\nAnd uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but a a bill grow up in the Boston area a seminar were lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister\nWho just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nUm and he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid\nAnd um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into when it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties as it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we could not find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a lot regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know didn't surprise me because of\nUh the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history [noise]\nUh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes into special forces are and um and it's also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and I'm logos off a\nThe Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire\nA so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and uh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers up\nYour nose you know for years they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand so to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after the devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so um that was to Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Bay roots clandestine war was the ... where do you well know might be\nWell ah the station chief uh um his usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the or the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that two million such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on him no doubt\nWell uh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um ... you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day\nA in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't he have security around\n[noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first hand from that time period it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security\nUh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole ... professional\nUh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some\nGet a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but uh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase\nIt was an entourage so ah the nature of the job and not and that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um\nI was part of the hostage de briefing team where are we were assigned a at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him an instant and visa button Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died\nAnd that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so\nThen it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWell must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack rental\nOh my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it wasn't that time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nUm and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran\nA and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut while I'm which I'm not you certainly a smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time ... wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's call them accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture I'm Bill Buckley are revealed information\nI'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence apparatus in Lebanon\nSo he knew the names of the other agents he knew the names of their sources\nSo you're not us some help our hazards

we're ...\nWere they are because it's the holy land it's where\nJesus and everything else began for them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available no doubt about that but it's not just about land a part of the issue is fighting over the holy land itself\nSham I Want you to take that question\nUm there was land but it's not their land and I'm I'm\nI I I think trying to settle um where people go at this point is a ...\nThat's not going to happen or it's way too late so it's sort of wondering if you should ever have them you know the\nThe second burrito I'm forty years after you've heard the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand that the Arab Israeli conflict is that the experts the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula\nThat um you know it all the\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians can be an end to go shoot of these like everyone else and they're missing I Believe is a critical point and\nThat is that the mathematical equation that they're working on the floor of the state of Israel was um a lot of creative the Israeli DNA dictate the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um you would dream of moments of raising the flag\nWhere they can say that their ... their opinion\nThere equals that they've ... they've achieved Harry\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach the very very small neighborhood\nUm are are bent ... are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action for just the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks and while still can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempt to\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George morning he bright\nHey listen ah name what about what a mess over there in the middle east and and and than it used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there right outside of Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decade and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is\nA wish William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave up secrets and I don't know you know we get it or not was there any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field\nOr from the information that he might have given up\nAnd keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure a good question Brian uh answer your question is are at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a shop\nA they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAnticipate a the entire source chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shutdown stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart a year entire um human collection network which is never easy\nOh certainly shut down stopped a until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nAre some um has blood is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that in that Israel has below fighters are getting on\nOn short on characteristic Lee I'm a crucial combat experience in counter insurgency um capabilities fighting in Syria um\nThe the\nLebanese fighters in\nIn in Syria have played a significant role in in

throughout the world including South America\nAnd um have remained a clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\n... do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\nUm yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela a in a previous work that I did um [noise] um [noise] we learned that um the the government though I'm president maturing in Venezuela\nUm had a um a a shuttle service\nOn the Venezuelan UM Airlines traveling Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way I got to cut and then from Lebanon being dispersed\nThroughout um points throughout the um Europe in the middle east um money the money from

Freda want to get your take on the ... situation of course and\nOf course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning a truly he was killed at the consulate butchered uh I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia a but geez my gosh what's your take on that\nMy goodness Georgia I can never remember\nAnother incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time uh now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah disposed of some bodies via similar methods that we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates a\nIn this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together a to actually do this or inside a diplomatic facility uh with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world are you certainly could\nEars that are on every diplomatic facility in the world\nAre you certainly could could have thought of a a much better operation and and so uh either it was done with the purposeful intent is to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I've I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now the curious part to George with this is a based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for a there appears to then\nA few other a Saudi prince lives that have disappeared too so um\nSince since the since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident uh and ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to a Saudi a outreach and covert action or to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of a of the royal family but uh\nUh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter ... when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of royals away at the Ritz Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is round or or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened in a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a\nA effort behind the scenes to to try to make sense of what took place and and to move forward or you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business\nAnd um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work\nAnd uh and the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still an intelligence provider\nNo that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with a double isn't it\n[noise] well most relationships with governments are uh at times [laughter] yeah I'm a ... on sad to say and it's just the nature of the business you know some\nOf rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like ah with our five eyes relationships um but you know those don't at times working smoothly as a as most people think\nAh because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services so that's the one mantra that you learn and and basic agent school\nIs a there are no friendly intelligence services and then each nation state is going to operate and what they feel is from the best interests of their country\nAnd you're more cars Yogi apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer Adnan ... uh there was so big you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so ... that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking event uh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile\nAh and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe I mean he's more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know wasn't one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe\nPaul when ... you know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do\nDo these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they gonna rats on the person said get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison and a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish president that's that's the one getting\nYeah that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx let's get started Tom go ahead\nAnd I like to say that the latest a horrendous caper is Yemen\nI mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name and out in you or how can it be said that they want peace\nIt can be said that they want peace between\nIsrael and the Palestinians when they have this when they have these terrible stories going on one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take ... and make it a temporary a hot when the over the was\nNot for oiled and that will go not a silver but for the sake of humanity to stop the gas and from a\nSending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing get is

horrible situation there\nA coffee of course we know Boy Scout we hated the guy was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid a you went straight gave up his nukes and his new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh\nYou know the state department or has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh\nAnd uh you look at bin ... I\nI'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization my old outfit is hired more agents\nAh they've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire uh they've worked with empty and why to develop protocols for that or as an agent uh I was never trained at the state department or a ... as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so\nThere's been a lot of lessons learned and a lot of changes made in protection\nA ... he was a mess I mean ... Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh\nOr as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been and um\nThe agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA um security support team were heroes you know they came and uh and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but uh [noise]\nUm it's just a a another long list of disasters that have happened and and um let's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon\nHow many Libyans storm our embassy\nWould happen if you didn't follow the established path\nWould you feel scared propriety could you explain that helping the people of Peru improve their own community would also have an effect on your own [noise] would you rather make her own way we spend a lifetime say what is life is called how far\nWill you go Peace Corps and find out more one eight hundred or two for eight five eight to go to a Peace Corps dot Gov\nThat's wrong now tell me they're not few shot their ship on I specifically said no ship on and then what\nGives me\nI'm not going to know whether guys checking me out are just looking for the number of a good mechanic\nThere's a better way to recycle your outdated ... all one eight seven seven to get ... dot com to find out how\nWake up it's just a dream I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nI wouldn't buy a house maybe by anti links on may ... seven day on\nThat it's back to work in reality for all of us is except somebody or some group in South Carolina where there was one and only one wedding mega millions tickets but\nSouth Carolina is one of the few states that doesn't require lottery winners to make themselves known to the public so whoever got that ticket may just keep it to themselves Fox\nIs Jill NATO we're now just learning the jackpot was not a record after all mega millions downgraded the prized at one point five three seven billion dollars that the one point six estimated if you take the one time lump sum payment it's around nine hundred million\nA second caravans forming Guatemala and the wall Street Journal reports as many as a few thousand may follow the first caravan of seven thousand migrants\nFrom a security standpoint there is no proper Kenny\nThe individuals and the care of an hour and this poses an unacceptable security risk to the United states\nOf state Pompeo or just people to come here legally national security adviser John Bolton is not backing down after two days of talks in Moscow about Soviet era nuclear arms treaty\nThe Americans edition Russia's violation so\nHe says the U.S sometimes to pull out of it something that President Trump and food and may discuss next month I decided on lottery live London\nDay the Kremlin describing President Trump stretch to develop new ballistic missiles after quitting the intermediate range nuclear forces tricky as an extremely dangerous in tension that would make the will less safe Russia deny violating the agreement president ...

Ness monster all the whole thing\nAll comes from the same thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about it a lot\nUm but it's it's an endless fascination with us than with a lot of people\nWell and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken and even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making these stories that they she goes to new lows and big foot you've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very under usual and that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\nUh-huh Russia it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda molten now who's a reporter Mac or she's an expert in crop formations and are truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources of the man and one of those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it does\nIt was a little sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them are done that way and I told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one is the unusual one it's amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nCan absolutely for sure and I like a ghost story you know if you could talk to if there's one person who has come back here from the afterlife sets it most amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the
