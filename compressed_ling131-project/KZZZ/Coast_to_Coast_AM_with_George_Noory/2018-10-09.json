workers probably you can't have a million workers a sibling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nIn Ninety Seventy you're at a million women entered the workforce every year\nOr so you every year you you put a million more workers in and yet that didn't make on a plan that go up either it was just new technologies more people are more jobs more well more prosperity\nSo I think the I think anything that multiplies human ability is you know with ... with a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet and\nSo that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you will do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's picking up by going to Jackson, Tennessee welcome to the program to get started hey Jeffrey go ahead\nHey I've talked to on the phone I Love your show George thank you Joe ... or not but I don't want to fly out that some ... and fire [laughter] hey I tell you what slate and back down and show\nWow no saying that don't say that but what what's wrong film\nI'm disabled and I don't follow it that I have faith that jobs I mean the technology that taking out the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs right I mean look at\nYou you can look at the unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work or almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring\nI'm ... you know technology always\nEmpowers people to be able to do more ... there was this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you you can make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it you make something worth more than ...\nWhatever value you were able to add that to wage\nAnd because technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of\nShake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that\nUp because you know it you can say well it's all going to work out on the long run but people live in the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we've we've got to be very mindful of that or we trained people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but to turn against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive as bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nNow I'm opposed to and I said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers are there are hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust a driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of a myth that a\nIs there is going to be a huge a shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know without kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up\nBecause everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's no future in that because of self driving trucks so\nMost knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're gonna have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles and then when we get over the legislative turtles they they still were only going to be able to do part of the hall\nI still don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic it'll go crazy [laughter]\n[laughter] well I agree there's a long way or the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car makes\nIt's a huge ... in in in ... Arizona driverless car till the woman\nMhm yeah a couple of months that makes the news which causes of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to have something to\nBe at least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nNo I mean so we put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nTo say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say while it would be better if\n\nNo I mean we put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say well it would be better if if we all woke up within fewer IQ points tomorrow\nHey I says what study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's the collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something\nAh and figure it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they taught somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience become the data to make somebody else's life better in the future and some no no the technology to say artificial intelligence is that it would be to say intelligence somehow bad\nWe've got Joe in

um yeah I I think that um I think Danny thought that my um I I I\nUm I think Danny thought that my um I I I he for one is he really believes and my stories and I think he is I'm a supporter of of those of us who are willing to put themselves out there\nTo really kind of continue the cause if you will um which is to get people to open up\nAnd um and I think he was amused because my book is also kind of funny\nYou you you got a little more to it I got all I get a little southern\nWet that kind of\n\nInteresting Georgia's that after I started seeing the ghosts and photographs I started to get all of the players all of a psychic powers ... so I was able to see them without a camera there boy and\nYou probably have the power you're you just didn't really realize\nI I think you're right I think it opened me up to do all of it even clear is that even though existed you know there's this I called the smelly Claire it's like a a Claire olfactory I'd sell perfume from a woman from the Seventeen hundreds at one point\nYou know happens\nCleared goose stunts where you can taste something from the other side and so it was and it all started like ... like a waterfall just on top of my head all just started to happen\nDo you find that they need to know more and more will do\n[noise] um [laughter] different ones happen at different times I can be in a restaurant now and uh I Can't focus because there's too many dead people and I mean yeah it it some time and and so I've tried to I've been to\nThe food that bad [laughter] depends where you're eating [laughter] um\nI think that\nYou know I I think that our our loved ones that have passed um you know they see folks that are kept in his beacons and they come to them and I think that at certain times maybe my lights a little brighter than others\nAnd they just start gravitating and I'm just I kinda like have to push you know I actually physically move my arms and my hands that guy's not right now luckily my friends and my colleagues have gotten used to be doing that\nAre like you before the break ...\n\n... ... yeah that just changed\nI got one for those of\nYou that aren't familiar with Los Angeles the four oh five\nMajor freeway\nSran damn freeways um five hundred thousand people a day travel and the four or five just to give everybody a perspective I take the four or five every day to work\nAnd this one particular morning\nUm I ... you know I I call people whether friends or work on on my way and like many I'm probably an hour in the car this particular morning nobody picked up the phone I called five people in knowing picked up so I get on to the four or five and I'm Around at Sunset Boulevard\nAnd um my radio is everything is off I have my left hand on the steering wheel and I hear a voice as clear as you can hear mine right now that says put your other hand on the wheel\nIf your phone rings don't look at it in fact don't answer it and then there was a pause and then the voice said there's ... there's going to be an accident\nSo I have my hands ten and two looking around you know it's a four or five so you can't move lanes in rush hour show bumper to bumper worse\nDoc [noise] although we we move it those who know the traffic flow you actually move once who um are going south on the four or five past ... so I'm moving and then once I hit hit will share of the two cars in my line in front of me quite\nSo I pump on my breaks to let the folks behind me know something's happened and then I slam on\nLine hoping you don't get smashed\nWell right but see I was ... I I was ready so I was prepared to knowing that I needed to do that\nThe situation is coming so um I you know I fortunately didn't hit one no one hit me and I checked to make sure everybody's okay get back to the car and I called my wife Suzanne\nAnd I tell her what happens and she said you are just so calm and I'm like yeah I Know I it's I was ready and she asked who was I said I don't know and she goes was Mona\nAnd I'm like no it wasn't moan and just everybody knows Mona is was one of our best friends that was killed in a car accident five months after my mother died of Alzheimer's so I was getting like the double\nDuty of grief and I said it was a man's voice\nAnd she was she was like oh you think of one of them I I I still don't know and she said call Patricia and see if she knows I'm Patricia I'm\nBank ends a owns the crystal matrix and out\nI'm bank ends I own the crystal matrix and Atwater village and she has a brilliant psychic and gifted teacher she's incredible and sells really great crystals down so either way than many in Los Angeles is interested and as I call Patricia and\nAnd I tell her story and she goes oh my that sounds like that was your spirit\nGuide because I've never heard such specificity she goes you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if you're willing to be open unless and they're there to help us and I was a really good thing because you'd have hurt that woman in the car in front of me and she has no\nBaby\nThere wasn't a woman in front of you their life that your guy with saving it was yours [laughter] that's right\nI went oh\nOkay [noise] does that change you well it it in in a second it did so I go to work have a weird day [laughter] 'cause I'm thinking you know what a crazy morning\nThat ... that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is known a sister who was killed Amazon the car when it happened so is pants husband\nSustained permanent brand brain damage as of today from that accident [noise] for the call Pam tells the story\nAnd she says huh she just want to hear the other half of your story and I said sure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you call this one I had found in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go reach for the phone that's paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said I imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today she's like yeah he was dead and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson gift\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you the pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your pitch mhm are you aiming at something or does it just how\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it was an ad and all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke as like a canvas for go I was\nAble to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see their shapes either form\nIt without the smoke they were up there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWith amazing gift you still with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come

course is interesting ... were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it it definitely is coming true it it was funny I um when I'm sitting with my publisher she was asking me about one of my photographs and I said you know some creatures on that I that I get in these photographs looked like they ... out of it is that I'm marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world and make it isn't that crazy during the day and make believe and then at night\nYou'd comes true it kind of [laughter]\nHave you ever gotten to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did what happened one time yeah you know and we can start going weird\nYes I did when our\nTime's yeah you know and we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to\nBecause some of the things I encountered um are\nAre strange and some are scary and you know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire sentence really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel\nUm if there is a ... a bad entity an evil entity that is around\nAnd I learned something really important for folks to understand um and that is if you if if we find themselves\nWhere they have a ghost in their house or they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do is be in charge because they are in charge\nBecause it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominant is like dominance like you you can get rid of most of them like that and that's what I found because they started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma I've ... um upbringing I was raised Episcopalian and so I knew the Lord's Prayer had used for really long time um\nI work for you\n... ... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is I Would start saying the I like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I stand ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nUsually all our interests while I was gonna say do you think everybody is capability that you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we're all born with different gift that we're able to happen to\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nFrom the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know it perhaps I have you know so few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because ... of course media you'd be ... you Google ... when you were experiencing this\n[noise] you know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right in your kind of becomes your reality you want to see you want to know you're not the only one\n\nAnd I think I was looking to see how common are uncommon specifically the photograph ...\nUm I started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of ease my nerves and then and then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true towns\nAnd one of them is that movie the witch and\nDid you do you haven't seen the which I have not seen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the Salem witch trial\nAnd I'm\nDavid ... who is the kind of a friend of mine is the producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day\nAnd there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess\nAnd he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer so they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he was like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDefining rod to find them to know\nAnd I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me [laughter]\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this is that all this to sort of happened to me and there was no instruction book you know I was able to identify were ghost were I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of a ...\nI was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his face um I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans um protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou know the ... ... ... ... well it was just like the old actions room\nI did for a little bit on this well he could be a cool it would be I mean\nPeople have woken up for re launched lead because they can't lose ... syndrome then you realize that you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the old ... syndrome where you were basically ...\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of fleet paralysis and um\nAnd there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you know how do you how much money I I I'm a friend and her on Facebook and I read her book ... I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the house she\nAbsolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex are telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right um he had Wes Craven um have sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on that man\n\nIt came to him not to write and nightmares right what was\nInteresting with Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read these books I talked to friends\nUm and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans crystal therapist so I\nStuck to the big oil you know I started to yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George such don't just take a few pictures that goes I mean go all the way\n[laughter] no fun to\nWrite and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened and I learned about the stone called black terminally\nAnd black ... is a really powerful rock it is not the prettiest rock and their personal kingdom but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter\n[noise] um it's been studied by the curious and also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been a lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been use you know by magicians and those to like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it\nAnd um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex is it how it's supposed to send your night stand\nI said I have a feeling that it has a enough of a range to it that will protect you while you sleep\nFor the will Rogers is to to\nGet sick I funding enough time to ... a little family activity [noise] right ...

marketed 'em and\nYou know it's really interesting concept 'cause it's the one that gets people really uncomfortable because so many people actually believe in aliens who just don't believe they're here\nAnd I was asked the other day it's like well do you actually believe I said how can how can I not okay not believe you know it it was in my backyard\nI Wonder if these movie characters\nAre all these movies you dealt with are coming alive\nWell sure I have a different philosophy what if it's possible that those that are actually making the movies are seen them themselves [noise] one of ...

years as a very successful tech entrepreneur with multiple IPO's Byron is uniquely suited to comment on the effect of technology in the workplace and on society as well he writes\nBooks that explore the wonders of the world of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid\nPresentations on the future of work in life\nAnd here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way Byron\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people's jobs but I'm\nNot that close to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and it records all the answers and and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not\nSo no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we all kind of better off because of all\nLet's talk a little bit by run about an artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander\nData upstart truckers see three arena or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's creative they can teach itself new things\nAnd we don't we don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build back and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy\nOr just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like ... cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to\nHer or something like that can be used to to trip to follow people voice ... just to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded and it could be turned into text computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera\nEven if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and they get all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies\nBut they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world um you know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right [laughter]\nRight run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you go when if you don't fly on airplanes anymore you do um and and do you do your kids don't get into good\nSchools and you don't get any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilant Senate so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nViolence is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even the Ninety nine percent of them are probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just said the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nAh it doesn't have to understand it and the way human understand something it decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of build up bill obstruct profiles on people I mean from what I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be\nGood there's so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand\nOr a let's say that there were a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is\nIs set up to pick up code words like bomb ... whatever and so with signs this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have as a side of consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh and now that that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch your\nTime [noise] never missed a detail of the show or against sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nDoes it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty\nPlays on my website asking central question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no vending machine could ever do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work we dodged just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is um\n... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess him on the computer complete go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's it's one reason zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off a at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it it goes like this series is\nThere's this room a that's full of these books and there's a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this trying to the library in the library and picks them up\nLooks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine\nLooks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the library and understand Chinese\nAs it does the library and understand Chinese did to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow they'll librarian doesn't know if they're talking about color or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determine this ...\nProcess as a memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know which playing chess it doesn't know any what it's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not\nA by my way of looking at doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that is that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt it is just mind boggling and it's getting even better or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple shorthand they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those you know you have all this data coming enemies faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literal you in in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a

workplace and on society as well he writes books that explore the wonders of the world of some moral and delights audiences all over the planet with his vivid presentations on the future of work in life and\nHere he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take the take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets\nOne of them is what you mentioned which has 'em robots taking people's jobs\nBut I'm not a pest on my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk and records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not\nA so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or exactly what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex and you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means\nBut what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common\nSo they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three arena or a that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are foster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many of us can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation\nUnfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like ...\nCancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded and it can be turned into text a compass\nThey can be recorded and it can be turned into text computers are as good as humans that reading lip so every camera even if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device the trucks where you are and they get all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right you\nWrite run a red light you lose a point if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and ah if you if you go when if you don't fly on airplanes anymore you don't um and and do you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have the capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this is governed by laws the price of liberty is the parental vigilant Senate so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and forced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nViolence is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though in Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is it a point where\nThey could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it in the way that human understand something that decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of build up built abstract profiles on people I mean what I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be\nTo do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is\nIs set up to pick up code words like bomb ... whatever\nAnd so it finds this\nUh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators\nI'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\nWell it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have this side of consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh another that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right we'll stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't touch you\nDial never missed a detail and his show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletters available for free at ... dot com\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nBecause it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley I'm probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that\nAnd yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build\nI'm worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work we dodged just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is\nUm ... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there\nThat does any thinking at all it's\nOne lives in zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off or at the speed of light um it's done with which relative it's interesting the techniques for years for the official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about it ... it goes like this series is\nThere's this rumor or that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nPeople outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese ... librarian the librarian picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question\nGoes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another vote to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the librarian understand Chinese as it does the library and understand Chinese did turn to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an act one because that's all the computer does runs a set of determining ...\nProcesses in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know which playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not it does the computer understand anything or not\nAh my my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that is that something that doesn't understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and it's getting even then or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those who they have all this data coming enemies faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago a literally in Ninety three\nAnd all that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes everybody's smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative than\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\n[noise] that is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nUh there there's a couple of different sides to that you know I have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupted and I tell it to stop\nIn a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had student had kids in Japan and there was a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother it would beat it\nBut they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and\nThe robot learned benefit salt bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kids said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even though like it was internalized and get you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that are raising children on fake empathy and you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do do any human being\nAnd because there's something special about a human being and and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and\nAnd and destroy without a second thought was that in some way how to nothing effect on people now the question Ken they feel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something a computer right now we don't think\nUh can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screening at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that ... ... or ... now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever develop a emotions\nAnd even if they claim that they did that could just be in a way of program running that you know the the the program reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it once by making this claim I'm so\nIt it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punch you back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go road and they start doing things to watch to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm\nA little like ... from two thousand once the sun right\nI mean look if it ever happened ah we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet you know smart ovens just part of all on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways\nA malevolent machine would want to um would be able\nTo inflict harm the the interesting and and so you kind of have to say what would

Arizona driverless car till the ...\n... yeah a couple of months that makes the news which you know thousands of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to have something to\nBe at least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say\nUh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nNo I mean certainly put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to

I I was ready so I was prepared to knowing that I needed to do that is the situation is coming so um I you know I fortunately didn't have any one no one hit me and I checked to make sure everybody's okay get back to the car and I called my wife Suzanne\nAnd I tell her what happens and she said you were just so calm and I'm like yeah I Know I it's I was ready and she asked who it was I said I don't know and she goes was Mona\nAnd I'm like no it wasn't known and just everybody knows the Mona is was one of our best friends that was killed in a car accident five months after my mother died of Alzheimer's so I was getting like the double\nDuty of grief and I said it was a man's voice\nAnd she was she was like oh you think it was like I still don't know and she said call Patricia and see if she knows I'm Patricia I'm bank ends ... owns the crystal matrix and Atwater village and she is a brilliant psychic and gifted teacher she's incredible\nAnd sells really great crystals and stones by the way many in Los Angeles as interested and I'm so I called Patricia and\nAnd I tell her story and she goes oh my that sounds\nLike that was your spirit guide because I'd never heard such specificity because you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if we're willing to be open in less than they are there to help us and I said well it's a really good thing because kind of hurt that woman in the car in front of me and she has no\nBaby it wasn't a woman in front of you their life\nThat your guy was saving it was yours that's right\nI went oh okay\n[noise] does it change you well it it in in a second it did so I go to work have a weird day [laughter] because I'm thinking\nYou know what a crazy morning that ... that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is Mona sister who was killed him was in the car when it happened so it was ... husband who\nSustained permanent brand brain damage of as of today from that accident [noise] so called Pam tells the story and she says huh\nWho just want to hear the other half of your story and I said sure\nShe said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you called this morning I had the phone in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go reach for the phone\nBut I was paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said imagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today she's like yeah he would and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson\nIs about paying attention\nPeople say what's your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you to pay attention\nAnd trust yourself when you do you teach mhm are you aiming at something or does it just\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it wasn't hadn't all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke has like a canvas for goes I was\nAble to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pulled a smoke around them see their shapes either form\nIt was ... they were not there you could not see them\nAnd without the smoke I could still see ghosts but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke\nWas amazing just you know there was this Julie we're gonna take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work the ghosts will talk roofer in our second hour we will\nOpen up the phone\nNumber ... ... email us ... Duncan [noise]\nOoh\nOoh [noise]\nTry and look for jobs by to get one free centers exotic for like\nThe I. N. O. V. I. T. E.\n[noise]\n\nMan will come back to coach the goals were back with Julie ... book is called the ghosts photographer\nLove the subtitle of course is interesting ... were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world will make believe is coming true was\nIt it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get in these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of make believe I sit isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou comes true it comes to [laughter] have you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did one out of all times yeah you know when we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to\nBecause some of the things I encountered um are\nAre strange and some are scary and you know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire sent in really that that gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel\nUm if there is a ... a bad entity and evil entity that is around\nAnd I learned something really important for folks that to understand um and that is if you if if we find themselves\nWhere they have it goes in their house they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do is be in charge because they are in charge\nIt's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominant is like dominance like you you can get rid of a seven like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I again my Oklahoma I've ... um upbringing\nWas raised in ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer\nHadn't used for really long time I'm\nGoing to work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though I like I start seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] I mean when you think we all are telling the truth\nWhile I was gonna say do you think everybody has this capability that you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to tap into yes\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen from the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know it perhaps I have you know\nA few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media a big way Mm you Google ... when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise] you know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right and your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see a want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how common\nAre uncommon specifically the photograph did you get answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about if that really kind of ease my nerves and then and then of course I turned to the movies\nAnd there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch\nAnd did you do you ever see the which\nI have not seen you haven't\nSeen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like this\nThey're not saying that there was a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film which Trump and\nI'm\nJay ... who is the kind of a friend of mine is the producer and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day and there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around\nI'm the son who is um a possess and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nSo they all start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking um because there was a there was a a\nLike a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDefining rod\nTo find them to know and\nAnd I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this this started happening to me and there was no instruction book you know I was able to identify were goes to war I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his face um I was able to figure out how to help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou know ... ... ... ... well\nIt was just like the ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this well he could be medical it could be could be\nPeople have woken up it relies lead because they can't ... syndrome then you realize that you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of ... syndrome where you basically Perot watch\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you don't mind the homeless ...\nI I I'm I rented her on Facebook and I read her book\nGreek I think Rudy is tremendous expert on the half\nShe absolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex are telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm uh Freddy right um he had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on the ... man because it came to\nHim that's right and nightmares right it was\nInteresting with Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans physical therapist so I\nDo this stuff is a big way no way I started\nTo yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George do to take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\n[laughter] no fun to\nWrite and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened\nAnd I learned about this stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful rocket is not the prettiest rock and the crystal kingdom but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting\nOn the counter um it's been studied by the curious and also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been a\nLot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been use you know by magicians and those to like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um\nAnd I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex and Alex with us on your night stand I said I have a feeling", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to
