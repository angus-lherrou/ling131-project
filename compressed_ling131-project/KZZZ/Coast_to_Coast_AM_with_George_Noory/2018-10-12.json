S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference these Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension\nIn that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African American you wrote in a democratic\nBig deal ... what what was his point\nWhile he well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nUh reinvigorate in Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republicans and Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running present and they're both courting the Puerto Ricans because they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do\nThat won him a crowded you isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidized the red states and the state to receive the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell with the stresses me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast does an SOS the mid west\nAnd I was ... um for your guest\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years and ... what you're saying this was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement influence thirty five years almost forty years or entity which was nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then the two thousand they almost kind of ... we have a meeting of thousands of it's about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks or entity and I don't trust in the body on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm Frank rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back\nBut the thing is what do we ask our financial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYeah you know real quick they these two ... not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing in monetary policy's\nPush down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but but you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThen they're in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive a pension plan today the best thing do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bombs\nUh corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return is way better than almost any stock the evidence\nBut those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down and interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rate so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors and pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen in thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and\nAnd those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks in class and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all their life okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the north east and the west coast succeed from the union it it would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in the whole EU California Hey Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise]\nI mean you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions in war and\nYou could argue that the world today than a\nThird world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and when global corporations cannot compromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country and a day or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles\nIt's cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan [noise] um but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge into World War one people don't realize globalization global trade\nCollapse sixty percent between World War one\nAnd World War two and with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening\nLike happen then this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they could definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because nobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political Steve this trade war we said and zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and there there could be some physical or but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade

thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\nThank you again for me information you always\nLove to reach people George because people need to hear this\nGeneration in Portland, Oregon walking to the program James\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the markets and new secular has to do with the ... and I happened to get in mid July just before the ... the gross but the average company\nWhich happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nOn the bottom fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly until the ... election this November because there are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that and now he says it is a danger of ah\nWhat you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly\nWhen we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most cars they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop and yes I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few years especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this is\nA long term social political Trent it's gonna go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went and the great depression entire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nAgain in your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what should the blond oh your ... how do you know when the boss back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at pass corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets even a de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range\nIs Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now if that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term\nBonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money\nNext step is moving in the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and he sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get\nTo buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show McCall correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yup okay Bush dies or Democrat\nRepublican yeah OK blue states Democrats were number a mixed then did you not say earner or did I miss I understand you've made you said the south was ran during the civil\nWar yes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican\nParty in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince\nA lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so you the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a ... in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican here are here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people going like that the red people won't but that all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats if it's a play of opposites that's\nJust as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other player of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong Congress think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and those gears that was not I guess that's science of when

I was just thinking about you right that's\nVery common um and I think everyone has the ability\nIf they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents but a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them was really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe\nThere was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they're paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ... runs in families [noise] um\nYeah that's true someone who say will say well my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nThat's right that's right yeah I in fact I had a great a great aunt had an experience where she fell asleep and she will cost and she said her brother had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards she found out yet to have you done\nIt yet but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do [noise] but you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common and women I think that's probably true plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these sites you experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\n[noise] I Would say both I Would say that those are sort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions\nWhat's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences that protest in the brain so for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and that was quite young\nI had one eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little ... I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling re looking at my body in bed I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother's a George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream man what a ... at that point it's lamb ... back into my body\nI woke up I was jarred a I'm a loving years old I don't know what the heck happened to me yeah but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since then at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I could find myself floating on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience have there is a neurologist in Montreal Dr ... field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on that trickle stimulation on the right temperature attacks he's able to produce and not have ... experience\nBut that doesn't tell me the other party experience originates in advance and that tells me that the that area being will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body fences we had it was quite straightforward um they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral\nProjection around novel\nPeople can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not at not at not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nHave another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has the second year medical student at ... examined the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dream\nSauce you have the answer that you knew exactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book his you know as I say in that that title I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people have been I think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with him right they're losing their mind something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... power I mean beside so we have paralegals where it can be fed lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on\nThe parent normal I mean beside normal it doesn't mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people will come up to me afterwards and share it with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to write the\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died in Dr ... curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with\nHim or her oh her in a it was my aunt\nAnd she ... she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yes and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy and that's all she\nAll that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that a lot of the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\nOh I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting I'm breakthrough to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander have and yeah and his surgeon\nAnd marry the Neal she loved to have it in ... north of ... of course Oliver Sacks is and they're all just to go to because of the nation so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another psychiatrist who who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy the meat you know she just do the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFell in there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show you that is terrible ... how did you get them interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were some things that had happened to her and she just decided there's something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my ... medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying the to the see\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had centers and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the G ... ... gi could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... the average rent gene state the senators were given invent them images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to the receivers and they found that people were more susceptible to telepathy when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to love to see when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the more Dr many major is with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students on the new version of the coast to coast am apple\nIs now available for iPhones and no word for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back with Dr many images were talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as per normal phenomena Mandy let's talk a little bit about to death bed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe they're extremely calm and don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative I'm actually happy with my dad when he was in the hospital he thought his late sister he mentioned oh they don't you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone was coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they call them visitors\nAnd as they got closer to death is visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions rent disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] [noise]\nSo yeah I think those those deaths that vision to a very common how one interesting thing about death that vision says that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone but this is ... who came to take advantage of fat and every three sisters who are at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it it's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\n[noise] and that's interesting because you know people who have death that vision the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen for lack of oxygen to the brain they try to get some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut at the visions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction their brains and they weren't on medication so [noise]\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that\nWeren't on medication so um it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWhen Steve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many yeah he was quoted as saying oh wow oh wow right now what do you think he's he was making reference to\nWell I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision\nYou know I'm a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that would be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you know it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ... how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the patients who who died and where we ... Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all have their lack of oxygen the brain\nNot just a ... a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and he didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked to him on under deathbed the decisions that\nThey sometimes she a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well which when\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician Melvin Martha work is dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the coughing\nDid anybody else you\nKnow so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me\nAnd I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition to the next level of the next world\nAnd they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDo they see you I don't think so okay I don't think they were there for me I think there were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you can go you saw\nThe fate [noise] now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions\nYou know um if they were produced by certain chemicals then why would the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they're the person is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... all one rather died and the other brother was near death so the the brother that was near death\nHad the vision of his dad brother but he hadn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was there and they have the cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead thing because the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre cognitive dreams you lose your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive beams\nWhat they are [noise] well there again I've had the cognitive games I mentioned one of the very powerful above yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive theme or if it's an anxiety dream\nBecause often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they try to process things that happened during the day or things that\nThey're worried about so\nYou know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered\nNow we could say that that was a peak cognitive team that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dreams maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\n[noise] maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to you so you're standing by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard that too yeah [noise] so that could have been ... cognitive invade another famous person who\nReported a ... interview with Charles Dickens\nReally I didn't hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put a new book he traveled around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give a reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nI'm a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman and a vegetable introduced himself to her with far words she said I Am miss Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid I'm often when we wake up in the morning I Dream start to fade the pre cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail\nSo the next day he went to give its reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him\nAnd there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... Napier\nSo so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or how to explain it but he he ... he had that the cognitive dream so um it's some people for example Larry ... a person has written about yes ... cognitive beans\nAnd he's written about when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's the cognitive theme or not\nAnd he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the agreements week current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um this woman told her husband\nBut did you know

you know you don't feel like you're going to get ridiculed down and I think it's important to water to therefore you're not so defensive\nThat's true and again I'm fascinated with the possibilities of

... there was a psychiatrist caught pet I don't know if you're familiar with him he loved the sure how the road less traveled okay and he wrote about a lot of paranormal experiences but he also got

first time caller Sherlock with those good morning sure all\nGood morning I'm so glad to be on your show\nI Am one into 'em hey thank you for your guest here I um had a really\nStrong very powerful encounter before Princess Diana passed away and um I Dreamed about her I visited her for like two weeks every night and my sleep\nAnd she gave me the whole like she just like\nTowards the end I was driving in the car and having lunch and she and we just talk and we just communicated\nHit it off well\nWe just hit it off and when the night that he died I was sitting on the couch with bad weather we're having form and I was doing laundry couldn't sleep and I just knew something was wrong in them and I thought everything happening on the\nTV screen it just was like so surreal it was just\nThat was the first time\nI've ever had anything like that ever happened to me um I don't know if anyone else who's ever had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died I had the same thing I had the vision of ... a dream for like two weeks\nAnd just couldn't sleep an uneasy feeling and two cops coming to his dad's door\nSo horrible and I didn't know what to think of it and it was just I've never had anything else like that happen [noise] um [noise] so um I I'm familiar you know I'm I've heard you know I just\nI don't know like I it only happens in hook people to me when if\nThey're going to die I kinda know high you know I kinda know things like do you do you tell them well um no no no I Know I don't know who's going to die I just get really just somebody's going to die\nI just um I get very I I started crying crying you know I I get very emotional and very sensitive and just crying and upset but not sure why\nMany what causes\nOf fifth don't want to say I'm Sorry to hear about your son and I was wondering um if you had any post death contact with him now any what how do I have not any contact with him since he died\nNow I have not and several people my daughters and several other friend path but no I have not and that's very troubling\n[noise] okay well in terms of your question [noise] uh George what causes that well I guess I Would call that a free cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know and I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all connected\n\nWe're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or\nAn actor and somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially someone very close to family members finish the you know the towns or sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say it's the latter I Would let them come to you know because they may not be ready\nYou have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you open to the experience and that you would love to hear from them and then and the ball is in their court\nLet's go to Virginia Keats with us welcome to the program Keith\nHi George how are you\nThere good good can you hear me okay yeah pretty good\nOkay great um I wanted to mention a couple of things one last night with your guest that called in but are too late to get on\nAnd uh it there are some commonality and some of the topics tonight about ah the paranormal and ah you know something I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and the\nA Judeo Christian teaches in the Bible and the missing link could be\nA the contents of a book called eternal man and anybody can Google that or search it on YouTube or Amazon\nYou can find different lectures and things about that and over the years times this book written by a B. Y. U. religion of ... professor and over the years I'm just listening to coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the normal or that ... that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps to give some understanding about this of of the eternal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm the switch to another topic really quick [noise] I'm a ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by\nA listener on the coast to coast a lot about near death experiences to friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other and about twenty five days after the second one\nI had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as for about\nThirteen Years ago I think and uh I can still remember today um I don't remember what happened before the than some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury in my dream but\nThe but it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that thought and and retain that fought in your consideration about the possibility of\nA the certainty of Dr Christine Blasey Ford about the events that she said happened to her\nBut yet all the people that she mentioned not a single one of them knew anything about that and uh the dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment\nWhere the second round as long as he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and and um he at the end of this time in the dream for me to\nMy brother and me I'll see you later and he looks at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was

were putting in the book together was there are some part of it that just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nI think the most interesting thing with the death dead vision\nYou know because I acting that I didn't realize how common that was [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and vision and out of body experiences associated with near death experience but I wasn't really ... with a deathbed vision or the visions of deceased loved ones that are also very arming\nThe death bed visions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I'd like to look at it and the point of view of the body plus the mind of the emotional life plus the spiritual life so I think that for different components each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them\nI mean the cases have ... people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win the lottery\nWow you know I'm I don't get those kind of dreams no\nMe neither but that acting verified [noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller sure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition Mm mhm [noise]\nIf you look at the Bible they certainly lots of their profits like Daniel and as the ... or if example Joseph you know what the cognitive beams or prophetic themes you might say and even in the history of the church people I think ... the the Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when John with Thirteen Years old she said she thought lining light light and he heard a voice which he identified at the arcade games on my call coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been\nDocumented by many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works Manny ... it's it's you know let's call it the God factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why sit there and the first place what do you think\n[noise] that for the first thing that came to my mind if it's out there to make our lives more meaningful it gets that the different level or a different dimension to where I live and then somehow\n[noise] [noise] ... the first thing that came to my mind is it's out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt gives us a different level or a different dimension to our lives and then somehow if that's something to feel like what we're going through even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be given by going to Joe in Long Island New York to Joseph go ahead\nYeah Hi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the dreams\nAre interestingly I had to drains recently that began with a preference of the day it's set of told the first\nAnd I ended up back to the beach or go on the water or it's a little rough but this other people's while they again it's usually warm which would be the case had I Want but I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same day\nIn real life so my question would be with your dream about the test\nThe next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's almost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise]\nUh so I ask you about that you know what do you think and the case that train for going to a really acting in your favor number one and then if the dream is\nNot quite calling and what and you're thinking that the aspects that are still really current and have current applications that you could cherry pick and how would you do that\nWell first of all your first question how do you know to be is acting in your favor or I'd say is is the content of the dream a warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is at telling you about something that's coming out for you and your life or is it about another person so I'd say\nIt's acting in your favor first of all if it's about you about another person\nAnd if it's and if the action is beneficial now in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because it can be some super fluid extraneous materials in the ... and that's not necessarily related to the main point and fixing\nSo I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel apply to you and which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nSo now to Joe yeah that that was good yeah\nGood next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west of the Rockies Mary

he yeah he told the neighbor are you ready to die and she was shocked she says oh I don't think about that no way I mean he was is\nUnusually ... being the night he passed it was three in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning and I was so sleepy that\nUm my brothers and sisters and I knew most of his brothers and sisters were dead they're out on the porch there waiting for me and he said I'm going with them and I was so he said look what keeps you seal I looked out the screen I didn't see anything and oh so he ah\nI went back to sleep because that was so sleepy three in the morning he didn't really laugh I didn't know what can we woke up the next morning and my mother's like have you guys see your dad and I told her I said mom\nHe told me last night he was going with his brothers and sisters and she was way shocked she knew\nThe ramifications but I did and my dad I think he was part native or something but he always told me he should win\nOlder people in the native culture get old you said they go out in the woods somewhere and they die I've heard some people in Alaska get in a kayak and just go out in you know the water and\nThat's what he did he want\n'em to the area that used to be an Indian burial ground area and they found him like two weeks later and I think\nFor many years in the south some people are really spooky and if you die in a home\nIt likes brain that stuff to it or he didn't want it frightened kids I think it's I think it was kind of had us find I don't know but he knew he was dying when they found it he did not look like he was struggling they said it looked like he did that when we're on just pack\nThat's a that's a great story ... in in many these visitors who come to us whether they're nearly departed or strangers

with us Michael ... that was a tense situation but you know what we got to have our own rocketry here in the United states\nYeah we absolutely do to argument is is it shows how unreliable the Russian

doesn't seem like much but it's three percent and you know you're flying up the international faith based at three percent fail you around your sisters is a is not acceptable because it\nI mean most

think it got to our version is that I mean I I\nOn an expanded and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those here because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really has time for us to make that they\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar yeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world in which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar know next time it goes to four\nThousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happened on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on well what did the indicators I mean mark in the last two days is really taking it on the ... the cause is it just panic or ... what's that\nWill will will to things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds shoot\nUp I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing that happened but the second thing is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating in a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty I'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I had this kind of limp rally for years and it's been waiting to go back and we said look it breaks twenty six forty\nThat that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack\nThese last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what is the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do\nIt the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous\nAnd and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happening like ... we had a couple more days of downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong\nYes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a correction like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market it happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing in every other one in the last century including the tech rack and recent bubbles that first\nAn injury including the tech rack and recent bubbles that first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months you know the way people\nGet walk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble\nHas finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people are already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so we did the danger sign as if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just the bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points and may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt\nIf the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make\nBubbles so dangerous um uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asked ... what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early because that ... this is above all this isn't a normal bull market\nCorrection an ice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and the crashing in half the time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent\nAnd it it the signs to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't talk here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year that we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally end of next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn off the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of like\nWent sideways and didn't deliver it to our debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation or runs in trouble\nChina is flowing and and like I said they have the biggest that bottle of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and stock crash\nBecause they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the tub backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse\nDebt bubble crashes and stuff than we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty but\nShe was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean that companies are doing down here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come bacteria dance with us his website name very dense D.

T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic\nCliff seeing all of a lifetime and ...\n... ... ... am no bribe bone you know we're not going to lose ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nCould still get when everybody else and they go down but it doesn't mean that company is going to go out of business right\nRight again well any time you get a major downturn in a recession or stock price like there's some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six\nTo seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently craft and a lot of companies were not as well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you're the part Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued and above all like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company and the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good\nThat they keep their earnings flat instead of declining\nThe valuations on stock how many times earnings like people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and and sixty or eighty for the best tax talk\nThose collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator someone what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know almost it's not a secret\nWell I Know I Know believe me Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened there the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stop and and and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors have over bought in stocks over about they're the ones that short first I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure this\nAction whether there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's one of the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's when those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures\nBut the smart money doing versus a dumb money and the smart money has not bought this rally in fact they've been shorting it\nThey've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crack now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is\nDeclined some smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal\nTo me in in recent months into our subscribers are you in Puerto Rico new I Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum she'd moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in ... to islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John and and you know no passport to come there\nIt's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming and I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the\nCorner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes an advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ...\nNot sure I liked that part well\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic\nI'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realize I I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto geyser coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualified there's real strong tax advantage so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director in Miami and two hours and almost anywhere in the east coast\nIs now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way if I'd have to go out to California which I just did it for a long pole ad that the long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years\nThe big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah ... and ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are buying banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but there there are George my biggest problem it's a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think\nWe're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X when there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like that otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um my\nVote in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and have much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and the U.S it's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S as always always robbing the best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to use your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year

investigating the cause of a booster problem that forced the Soyuz rocket capsule to make an emergency landing just after launch right after I got off the air with you last night my smartphone started binging with news of large it was this launched the two crew members the Russian cosmonauts\nThe American astronaut Nick Cage are in good health are okay they were heading for the six month mission on the international space station when their flight was boarded their capsule separated and landed about two hundred and fifty miles from their launch site\nMike barrel author of dark mission the secret history of NASA with us why did that was a tense situation but you know what we got to have our own rocketry you're in the United states\nYeah we absolutely do to argument is this just shows how unreliable the Russian hardware really it I mean this is an old are you a spacecraft on a cruise ship and getting for years they've they've had seven hundred and forty five like\nThey'd had Twenty one failures that that does seem like much but it's three percent and you know you're flying up the international space station or three percent fill your and your sisters is a it's not acceptable because it I mean most of the time you do not recovered the crew most of the time of year like this catastrophic\nOh absolutely absolutely you know I still wonder what are we doing on the eye assess the international space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for alien mostly I mean maybe\nThat old British TV show what would the U.S over that base in trigger detectors that they called it up I think it kind of our version is that I mean I I don't know what else are you when they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of by it but it\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna come examiner no\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at forty seven hundred dollar home next time\nIt goes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money\nNothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on well what did the indicators I mean mark in the last two days is really what's the cause is it just panic or ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher and lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean there's this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating and a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a down turn and crashing so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty I'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed forty five percent of three months and then I have this kind of limp rally for years and it's been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty\nThat that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it it did that in the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack\nThese last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways and Trump has been losing the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes\nGross to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do\nIf the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing they lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no\nThis was predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we gotta do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what have you ... we had a couple of more D's downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this or the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January\nReal kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough we have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kind of like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling insured in the market it happened very quickly you'll see you know I've seen just the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout history everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including the tech wreck in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half months\nWith people get walk and that's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble\nHas finally birth the problem is by time that comes people who are already in trouble and they're panicking and and they get whacked hard so we did the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand on the ballot\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred twenty five thousand on the Dow if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders are going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy\nEighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bottles so dangerous um uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross child wants to know when somebody asks what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit\nEarly because that's our ... this was above all this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the science to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here in the garden top here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so correction by the end of the year that we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally end of next year before this thing blows but the\nRight now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn out to the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash because we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd and of course China has been off the charts for now for Thirty years and in their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like\nWent sideways and didn't the leverage our debt emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation of runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that bubble of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so my view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash\nBecause they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just filled the backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse\nDebt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty\nPercent off absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back here ... with us this website is his name ... D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff and see all of a lifetime and ... ...\n... the new version of that goes to ... am Abu knowable bribe bone in now Android board on ... ... on demand anywhere any time good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company did survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build the dot com crash came in the last year and a half up six to seven times\nKind of like the big point bubble here recently cracked in a while\nI'm kind of liked the bitcoin bubble here recently craft and a lot of companies went under well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you'd upon Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies\nAnd you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up the that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so that's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good\nThat they keep their earnings flat instead of declining the valuations on stock how many times earnings white people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty\nAnd and sixty or eighty for the best textbook those collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down to fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so\nThat's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator someone's danger what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou should not she well I Know I Know but that believe\nMe Wall Street won't if there's any way so you don't have to worry but but what what happened to their the smart money or the people who who kind\nOf push ups stop and and and then when things go down there the ones that jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors of Boulder bought in stocks or about they're the ones that short for his\nI mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action what if there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index and what they do is the dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open court opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves to me well that's one of the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's when those reactions made that's the money\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus a dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shorting it they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico in them I Am in\nPuerto Rico and I went to hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo where it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here and Michael both of them similar force but this storm\nHung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blown off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's it's like you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum\nShe'd moved there well I moved\nThere because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and co labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has\n... in ... to islands that are like St Thomas\nAnd St Croix or St John and and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming and I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on\nA corner the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport\nWhich I get to twenty minutes an advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to tell\nYour ID they just wait to see how you're going to tell\nThe ... not sure I liked that part well\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane fly to scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island and one hour\nAnd once I got down here I realized I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living and the crypto guys are coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantage so on living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director in Miami in two hours and then almost anywhere in the east coast is\nNow it's difficult if I'm coming out your way if I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that\nThe long haul now but I tell ya I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years\nWe're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent here and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years the big banks down there\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah yeah and and and shrubs down here and actually a lot of the banks are by banker popular and Santander are Spanish Banks because this is by origin more as a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service\nSo people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or\nThey charge some huge acts and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like yeah otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I tell you people ought to be Americans ought to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nMind that we need both in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that they are allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving to the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants from Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why\nThey have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S it's better to help create good jobs down here through tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S as always always robbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to use your best impressions of what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now I'm conflict\n... it's unbelievable I've never seen it yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy when\nWhen we hear about people dying of curable and preventable diseases we might find ourselves saying someone

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension in that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you because I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African American you wrote in a democratic\nBig deal ... what what was his point\nWell he well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting devote all all the key\nSenate races up and guess who they're appealing to those Puerto Ricans the Republicans and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do use in\nThat one democratic ... isn't that what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nWhere I asked my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidize the red states and the and the state to receive the most was Kentucky where the idiot McConnell with the stresses me nuts and it's been like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast us until the mid west\nAnd I was ... for your guest\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years in ... what you're saying it's was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement for thirty five years almost forty years or entity which was nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with the ... the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost could obliterate is do we have a meeting novel thousands of it's about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks or entity and I don't trust any buddy on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm Frank rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what do we ask our\nFinancial people who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYeah you know real quick they to pop not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments\nLike treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more end but but you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive a pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bombs\nOr corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock the evidence but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down an interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors and pension funds to lock and quality bonds it's only the quality\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate [noise]\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for a pension plan is to do what everybody's that run into stocks in class and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the north east and the west coast succeed from the union it it would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in the whole EU California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise] I Need you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions\nIn war and\nYou could argue that the world today than a\nThird world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea that's cetera and one global corporations cannot compromise their differences in the global boardrooms\nThere's a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states and to a third world country and a day or two you know with a lecture magnetic poles\nThat cetera what is the probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we traced global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in the world war one people don't realize globalization global trade\nCollapsed sixty percent between World War one\nAnd World War two with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happening this works it it it's\nIt everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because nobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have\nIs there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen hundreds no there were major countervailing power is that's how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but there's certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike Harry with us we're coming back from final phone calls with you in just a moment on goes to goes to\nGet Daily Show up

R. dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coach the cultural with Harry Dent junior his ... dot com linked up at coast to coast am dot com and as we get into the final calls here Harry thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\nThank you again for me information you always\nYup love to reach people George because people need to hear this\nGeneration in Portland, Oregon walking to the program Jay go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market is the new sectarian has to do with the ... and I happen to get in mid July just before the huge and in the ... the gross but the average company\nWhich happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nOn the bottom fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is\nWould you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and kill the uh election this November because there are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that and now as it is a danger of ah\nWhat you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when\nWe have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop and yes I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens in the next few years especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah it seems crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nIs a long term social political Trent it's going to go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash in the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations in that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nYeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nVery when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what you are you how do you know when the boss back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine crutch and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets ... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I start by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds and CDs and T bills and stuff to preserve your money\nNext step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise]\nWait for the guy you may get to buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good Kentucky first time caller for civil Whelan\nHey George a lot of the show Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican you're okay blue states a Democrat\nHey George a lot of the show McCall correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican you're\nOkay blue states Democrat Democrat or make them do you not say earner or did I miss understand you that you said the south was read during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and help get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party he had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so you the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read\nIs Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican here are here to a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats if it's a play of opposites that's\nJust as important as men and women and booms and Boston inflation and deflation and every other player of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue ... I mean we can do all this stuff in the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong Congress think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby boomers we're going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and those gears that was not I guess that's science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\nMake something let's go to Gordon them like going forward on the wild card line in born in by the way next next week we're doing a show on a student loan\nOh oh wow what a coincidence now any yeah\nGeorge and Harry thanks for taking my call traditional greeting ... now first off I'm rolling conservative if you put in if you ask Google who's this Gordon over in Lakeland, Florida that last for three decision on the other thing I I did better than Jed Bush\nIt'll find me it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you\nIf you served honorably in our nation's armed forces and you're looking for a way to continue serving your fellow veterans and your community didn't join and that each year ... members volunteer millions of ours that VA healthcare facility from coast to coast helping to improve the lives of their fellow veterans through the VA voluntary services program\nAnd that posts and department talking to participate in a wide variety of community service projects ranging from Americanism in our schools supporting the Special Olympics and Boy Scouts of America even if you no longer wear the uniform today you can feel surfing the ambient light joining today at ... dot org\nYoung people everywhere are\nMaking a difference I shall on that has changed my life what I'm doing it for a very high\nI've made a difference now it's your turn to make it to get involved at Special Olympics dot org\n[noise]\nA lot of evil along the Florida Panhandle don't know what to do next I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nRoger gone we our lives everything we have shown our with our cars everything he's\nIn Mexico beach which is like ground zero for hurricane Michael\nHouses literally live from the tree houses to the front of the property down the road of water for a fact\nBoxer's\nGrip drink industry or the devastation felt like a helicopter many parts of the community you can only see slabs warehouse used to be we still have\nTo make sure we keep everybody safe and then we'll start the recovery process much\nLike a while to get the lights back on and simply just hundreds of thousands lost power there on the Georgia in the Carolinas and Virginia where there was also flooding some people needed to be rescued Michael's blamed for at least six deaths the Catholic Church priest sex abuse scandal hits Washington's archdiocese again Fox's Rachel Sutherland live in the\nDay Pope Francis is accepted the resignation of cardinal Donald Wuerl archbishop with Washington who was under fire for his handling of sexual abuse cases when he was bishop of Pittsburgh he\nWill be allowed to stay on in Washington until ... when ... minutes down in a state in the world expressed gratitude the pope Francis and said once again for any past errors in judgment I Apologize natural pardon cardinal Wuerl what's also accused of covering up for its predecessor former cardinal Theodore ... who resigned over the summer day for\nAngel in Turkey the American pastor detained for two years I'm Terrence buying charges is back in court today amid intense us pressure of ... going to be set free we're not expecting\nTo get an official ... today well we're hoping for is that his house arrest and travel ban will be lifted and he'll that by being able to leave the country and come home to the U.

and it was just completely spontaneous and I was quite young\nI had one eleven I'd never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little section I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling re looking at my body in bed or you stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother's a George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again and this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream man\nWhat a ... at that point it's lamb be back into my body I woke up by was jarred among eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just find myself voting on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Robert Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on electrical stimulation on the right tempo cortex he's able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the van that tells me that the that are being will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we had was quite straightforward\nUm they were in complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around novel people can leave not just their their body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that to the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and has effect on your medical student I dreamt of us Rajiv exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dream\n... you have the answer that you knew exactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it\nBecause it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that\nIt seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatize just paranormal phenomenon tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... power I mean beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on the parent normal I mean beside normally doesn't mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give a reading or if I give a talk somewhere it will come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told\nAnyway so I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and that was really what motivated me to read stuff\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr Shafiq curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with that she or her oh her in a it\nWas my aunt and she ... she went to a Oxford University\nRight and she got her degree in psychiatry yes and\nSpecialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was given all that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced totally convinced that\nSelected the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that in so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] although I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting um\nBreakthrough to creativity I'm\nDefinitely gonna look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who for having yeah and he's a neurosurgeon\nAnd marry the Neal she loved to have an impact she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in Iraq just he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things that I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that I mean she she just did the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away and a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nSmelled in their home no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show [laughter] no you that's terrible ...\nHow does he got so interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were getting into like the the\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to any teeth and um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the the voice when I Dream state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to ... the when they're asleep and it's also true that people are more susceptible\nTo collapse of the when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but\nIn my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr Mandy majors with us his book the borders of norm [noise]\n... the new version of the coast to coast am is now available for I don't know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back with Dr many major U.S we're talking about his work the borders of normal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize as paranormal phenomenon maybe let's talk a little bit about the deathbed visions and your thoughts about that though you believe the extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative I'm actually happening with my dad when he was in the hospital\nIf I'm actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh there's so and so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors\nAnd as they got closer to death these visitors became more frequent and these visitors were these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise]\nSo yeah I think those those deathbed visions are very common now one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\nAnd that's interesting because\nYou know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen if the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut it's a vision through shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction their brains\nAnd they weren't on medication so\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily relievers in the afterlife that these experiences are quite common\nWhen ... when Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you quoted as saying\nOoh wow awhile\nRight now what do you think he's huge making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know I'm a bright white light you know\nA spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that would be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you\nKnow what's the body itself is doing all these weird things near\nThe moment of doubt how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the the patients who who died and where we ... Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all have a lack of oxygen the brain\nNot just as a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication versus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked to him on under deathbed ... that\nThey sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well which we know\nWell the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician nothing more workers dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relatives\nTheir parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they've reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side\nI had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and did anybody else you know so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as they've done\nIn my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition to\nThe next level of the next world and there is the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's the only when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that\nWas too much for me to keep to myself\nDo they see you I don't think so\nI don't think they were there for me I think there were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... ... now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals\nThen why would the um visitors only ... the people who were deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they're the person who is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... all one brother died and the other brother was near death so the the brother that was near death\nHad the vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was dead and they'd rather cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because the family orange despair than the knowledge\nPre cognitive dreams you lose your thoughts on what they are\n[noise] well there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the very powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive beam or if it's an anxiety green because often and you know when people are sleeping during their dreams they'd try to protest things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered [noise] now we could say that that was a peak cognitive team that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill\nHim [noise] maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to you so you're standing by John ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard of that too yeah [noise]\nSo that could have been ... cognitive embed another famous person who reported a pre carved into view of Charles Dickens\nReally\nYeah 'cause when he would put out a new book he traveled around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was reading into a new\nTown where he'd never been before he had a dream that in a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with far words she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he\nThought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid I'm often when we wake up in the morning I Dream start to fade\nBut pre cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail so the next day he went to give us reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... Napier\nSo so this stream was pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or how to explain it but he he ... he had that the cognitive dream so um it's some people for example Larry ... is a person has written about\n... century cognitive beams and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into beam or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the agreements week\nOr if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um this woman told her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died in a terrorist attack\nMice Moore mentor me take\nYou helping create a business plan and helped me and some and when you were ... existing business score mentors can help you achieve business\nFor how to make unimaginable positive business school board to get started today\n[noise] introducing the YMCA sure you know the wife or a swim ... who who were more than that we recall\nWhen you take a jumps out at the Y. someone else is getting jobs during practice yoga as a team practice or leadership skills [noise]\nGet people of all ages incomes and backgrounds that chance to learn grow and thrive\n[noise]\nNow I live in deaths blamed on Michael honn name Anthony Fox news\nFive district board other Virginia for killed him flooding and a firefighter died when a truck hit him while he was responding to a crash Michael as a tropical storm also flooded areas of North Carolina after the hurricane power the Florida Panhandle and I thought that\nTrain for going by and I realized it was our house broken off the foundation and was floating around she's in\nMexico beach which of the worst damage to homes are gone all he can sing as the lab where they were more than one point two million homes and businesses without power Florida up to Virginia well the American pastor detained in Turkey the past two years be set free today\nAndrew Brunson is back in court and the prosecutor just recommend that he'd be released from house arrest pending the outcome of his trial on terror and spying occasionally the strained relations with the U.S there's a new report of proof that are missing journalist in Turkey was murdered Fox's Simon monitor live from London\nNow have the Washington Post to pay to Saudi Arabia and generally Jamal ...

statement actually and United\nAlmost like it's driving the last ... into a\nAnd it it sounds like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand at the veteran America is doing they are they are more and more angry\n[noise] well there's you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA ... that is a unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThe interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day they do a roar about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's\nListen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justices who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care and ensure that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can make those qualifications\nYour reaction to that well they do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guide but clearly he's not\nRunning for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with a with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion was he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the heart left\nA who're who're or we're seeing a create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd Senate or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the crews see\nWell I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry that people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shoved energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor president didn't intend to she said well he would have voted for a cabin all but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term than we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not I speaking back on the ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court tech\nThe incentive to me seems to be still\nThere for that type of circuits we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public they are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions elite town there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing that it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm as cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve doctor for its interests very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this I think they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA succession killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nPulling the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration\nWith outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone's lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I didn't I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next to you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party\nIs more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean just like this is not a fan of the presidents he wants to primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win re election Nikki Haley thinks she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time Laura I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think\nThat it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or\nOr cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot ask Jill\nMcCaskill exactly in Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is gonna be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West of parents in the\nOval Office yesterday\nI just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and now with everything that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has asked I'm here in West in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn\nTruck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not I\nI think so well it's just drive and he makes their heads explode and they act and all sorts of or Russia irrational", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George
