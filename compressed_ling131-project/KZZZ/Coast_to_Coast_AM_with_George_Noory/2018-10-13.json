I've I've called you a couple of times about ... and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened after ... board followed me as it said it would\nAnd I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd I'm at the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried\nCleansing my house with stage and everything else [noise] um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean and I'm I'm not getting anywhere you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of\nIn any where do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loose ends up emotional energy boosters up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense ... there is many substances that work very very well loosening up energy is kind of like springs\nSomething on the wall to get something off of it but it doesn't alone get rid of the home see that's the problem is is that stage\nWill release it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not move it from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property\nIn order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think that's going on here to Jay is the you've been releasing it\nBy doing these you know really positive things stage Frankenstein it's all of these things you know I'd recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home\nIn order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nIn to some extent but emotional energy and negatives there is all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the booming pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to have to take a dust pan yet\nThe you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energies from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy feels also known as the ... but the orders not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV or you know\nA pub just every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy field to be don't protect ourselves and most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not always just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled\nFull of emotional energy on the positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Jerry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\n... ah yeah George ah idea of what I'm a even as the original language of the scriptures and I'm I'm actually writing a book called that we really know\nGod is and I tell you the Bible in Nineteen eighty legs were I've dealt with a lot as a party a scene\nAnd I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous\nThe poll work hand in hand first prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a pattern of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so that non physical proceeds to ...\nIt was the physical fill the non physical proceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so\nEspecially like I said like baking a cake you know the spirits God angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eight years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle and her personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with it I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially swipe believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I work for Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to a jury for younger question go ahead Teri\nUh yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches African ... go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nAh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy the problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nBut you got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is genes is\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs deity genes this means humanity in crisis means anointed what\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the surface in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person but we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then ah our entire life we we are and and even Paul said this that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take funnel calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\n...

California's with Jamie Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey great work that you're doing Jeffrey my\nQuestion is about war and the battle field in war zones how towns\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica solved I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battlefield situation and you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and essentially they're our message throughout rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a a place where negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative ... says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us which is natural and the battle situation\nUh emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take the stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service\nTen minutes in the morning and ten minutes and the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we need we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy of this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also uh off the fear\nAnd here so I think that is very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved\nIn is not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists do not call me up and to argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body\nThat is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy\nA person's life a hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out\nIf they destroy your business than they have a two fold thing going on they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home that can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react sometimes violently and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a failed business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year so\nYou know think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes into the business after business comes in and you have problems of fields businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working or who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that's generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits\nBecause if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate for\nA you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what's they're picking up on George's emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on\nEverybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right it's emotional energy in the needs to be clear it out so they attack businesses because\nThey can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others\nWith their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go the Monique in some ... some ...

George thank you so much for having me on the show again to any traveling I've been enough in Connecticut I was in LA uh on Monday doing some new interviews for ancient aliens really excited about that you should look this up while you were here\nWell it was such a fast track and um [noise] so I just there overnight and a personal note I had a ... cat passed\nYesterday so it's kind of a really emotional you are very very difficult time his my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he he was eleven now\nJust there overnight and a personal note I had a ... cat who passed\nAway yesterday so it was really emotionally are very very difficult time he was my beloved buddy he's on his journey now how old was he was eleven\nNow that's not tools work yeah\nNo it's not as I said I was really hoping he'd be here a few more years and um\nBut his time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm going to miss I miss him dearly\n... somewhere you know that he's here with us now yup absolutely tell me if I'm watching\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a broad range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they here and and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers first humanities hills\nAnd that's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that they were here they came from the heavenly realm from the rump called ... according to the Bible the location of God's throne\nThey're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity of teaching about how humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly round to the heavenly realm of sigh on it it seems that that what's happened in the intervening centuries and by the way it was\nThe watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and then it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed by the ... the idea of scenes\nApocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial in some people's view\nWho delivers knowledge about another supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers\nAnd the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash and light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not right to did she squirrels as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman armies came into\nInto Jerusalem into Galileo the scenes bundled up their sacred tax which there were many hit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the ... what Rome are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new blood lines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings light beings ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh\nAnd blood oddities and face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status\nAnd then infiltrated human affairs\n... to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the long ... and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path\nChances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes and you're realizing that at the seams themselves were utilizing ancient tax in teaching that they had developed in synthesized from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the factor is\nThat were centered on how do we contact the watchers\nOne and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes\nA hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings to congregate with the angels the holy ones the angels of the lord\nThe watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLiked in other words into angels\n... which of course\nAnd in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the at a mile edgy of ... the meaning of the word ... it's far far from establish fact the term fallen angel is ... means that the are evil beings or that they are being who

establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out\nGod's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they\nDescended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was is that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others\nSimply decided that they were\nDemonic being that they were a\nHours that were beyond human control and certain humans\nBegan teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experience the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing the line with the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach humans and how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a ... cloud were gods rude on them to me it sounds like ... we'll it sounds kind of you and forged doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds isn't to feel which is the word where we get the word into feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and and the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of today are Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for\nTheir ascension body they're light Audi it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional a and throughout the cosmos\nArgue was William Henry his latest work the watchers of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative menthol it just goes after these gone that the visited us spiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their hobbies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of eyes they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches what the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nIn the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are the ... our body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails\nHave known nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great protection tradition originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could could step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form and then face back into their non physical light being for well\nYes that's exactly what you're doing if they fail to register with

recognized professional psychic ... teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses a psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on Huntington homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as spirit guide as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSoup or you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividuals and the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAh also and tradition um it's harvest time and a and the truth tradition of that but\nThere is a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media tastes more attention to it this time of year and that's fine anytime we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nJeffrey using demonic spiritual will get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of main green about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely are we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd ah I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels\nThere that powerful they are not regular people who have died just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they are very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical realm from the non physical route and actually produce physical effects\nAnd actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better equipped\nTo uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can't see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other other people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that a demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nA so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically\nAnd we all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in a day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\n... if they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes have feelings negative energies\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me if her it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nTwenty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked a successfully a few times for short to rations and is very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you tell I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school in grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom\nSome were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with the school work and some are looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to hit a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about that [noise]\n... no ... no ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic ... dot com

think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human said like\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work they attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us in generate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family destroy their lives\nAnd also try to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want to sell\nThey sure do ...\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind\nOf story of uh being in a home apartment condo party a part of any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy\nAnd that can influence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not\nNormally do that and so on were angry\nThat's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that they're there they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world\nWant to continue to hang around our world and\nYou just do things we would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy has generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely our own\nOr the under the direction of the devil Jeffrey I'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits\nI demonic spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always rule\nUh they do work in groups I have found that to be true in all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs an incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light will come out on an attack I pull out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just at work and at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they attacked\nPeople on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical round\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible they have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and

not all of all the ISPs would that's a fairly have made the right preparations for this there could be disruptive but it was very carefully planned out in practice what happened is they they did the roll over\nA yesterday yesterday afternoon I guess yeah there were I guess if you're a little glitch is here and there but they were ready for that\nThey uh they fix them and as everybody can tell the

are amazing couple hours we've got four you hear Jeffrey Steelman back with us internationally recognized professional psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses and psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good go such as spirit guide as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me act on your show the fifth time and a big hello everybody around our planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems also\nThis time and a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planets\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things which people but it seems also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividuals and the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition um it's harvest time and a and the truth tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year and that's fine any time we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever using demonic spiritual we'll get to do what do you think they are but do you think they expect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of ... certain things do you think demonic spirit ... something to do with that\nDefinitely are we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd ah I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so there are around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels\nThere that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah demonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better equipped\nTo ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can't see them and tell a path ethically trans for information\nInto our system our emotional systems Nick is angry at each other the other people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of the extra\nThe thing is you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits\nIt's also true that demonic spirits ah can change you know once\nThey were no positive spirits and their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nA so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically\nAnd we all communicate ... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people\nAre not all a violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits but they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things but demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an extra ...\nWhen I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of\nThem are more powerful than me that's right that's you know they could they could come and get you\nOh abs and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes and get a feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking forward to a vet the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nForty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you ... I was born\nWith the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom\nSome were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with a school work and some are looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they'd actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we are going to get a break and we're going to come back and talk more about these demonic spirits where do they come from what they want and the next hour we'll take phone calls all about the\n... the new version of the ... the map is now available ... now ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nThere's some exciting news simply safest now valued at one billion dollars this company used to be just fine guys working together\nNow they protect more than two million people simply said system is easy to use\nIncredibly intuitive and takes just minutes to set up their no contracts are hidden season twenty four seven monitoring is only fourteen Ninety nine a month visit simply say ignoring dot com the order you simply say system now and you'll get free shipping and free returns that simply said no re dot com simply say nor dot com\nI Love at first\nHe needs to be up and gave me the bass setting I have a nine ... every day on your favorite cosmetic consent to\nMake a fifty dollar Omar beauty of Franklin and you get a free makeup bad like on the tray out I'm a member of your mind you can help us to talk of breast cancer research foundation by making an insect any sense cage mental saying everything stage of the pie\nInto when we try to come up last month I had I lodged top condition these little side of the world's biggest killer of who stopped pecking kind of ... it it's just incredible feelings that I never felt before such is pins and needles ran my heart when I have the extra cottage or a two and a half months later\nSomething amazing happened which really taste while I was actually a contract is almost staggering about this was the staging a cheaper ... to ... a ton of Laura ... like a mighty result started coming for\nA ton of war that's when he was a major results coming for like a kind of ... excuse the pun and we're usually\nOn a Richard hospital here we're talking about the power waking up your immune system says he'll this gentleman's hard hats the immune system can be called one of the bodies finishes powers to he'll visit C.\nA.

A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three ... that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five [noise]\n\n\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human humans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true\nThey have nothing that we want and so ah they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work the attack everybody we all have targets on our pack and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them and they communicated with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business\nAnd you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives and also check to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right\nWhere they wanna sell they sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that you're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a part of any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange or picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things\nThat we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that and so on were angry\nThat's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they don't know that they're there they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not\nMost spirits are good summer not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nYou just do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts added they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating in thinking about generating a form of what they wanted to look like and also generating quotes\nAnd reading a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see naked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely our own are they under the direction of the devil Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I ... the monitor spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other\nThey most often work alone but that's not always rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families getting them to fight or getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify\nWhat would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I had been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on an attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirits you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are that\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time\nAnd lots of them are not good\nUh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nHorror who they have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack\nPeople least able to defend themselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\n... years in job earning when my sister came back to the last

a great late at night and I have some questions I have some issues\nI didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened often we'd you board followed me as it said it would [noise]\nAnd I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house with stage and everything else [noise] um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean\nAnd I'm I'm not getting anywhere do you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nWell definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loses up emotional energy it loses up negative\nAny where do you have any recommendations that might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loose ends up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense ... there's many substances that work very very well loosening up energy is kind of like spring something\nOn the wall to get something off of it but it doesn't alone get rid of the home see that's the problem is is that\nStage will release it\nYou know out into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property\nIn order for it to be removed because\nEssentially what I think it's going on here to Jay has he been releasing it\nBy doing these you know really positive things stage Frankenstein and all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home\nIn order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that it's just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nIn to some extent what emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nGet the you know a broom and and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the ... but the or is not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is their spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy field and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching TV or you know\nA pub just every place there is emotional energy enter ... energy fields have we don't protect ourselves and most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes havoc and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled\nFull of emotional energy on the positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI bet they feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nWell uh yeah George or I guess what I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm actually writing a book called that we really know God is\nAnd I tell you the Bible in Nineteen eighty wag I've dealt with a lot of the party a scene and I was going to ask you Jeffrey\nAre you a Christian I don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God I also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous\nThe poll work hand in hand first prince will is creation spirits phone just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angels God you know they create almost like the ... of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical ... non physical proceeds the physical\nThey create almost like a bad or of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe\nAnd then comes the physical ... non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen if the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so especially like I said like baking a cake you know the spirits God angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle and our personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with it I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially swipe believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think what you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to the jury for the other question go ahead Jerry\nAh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at for beach that God go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many minutes years out there that teach uh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off the guy\nThe problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't notice\nBut you've got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it said if it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is genes is\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs deity genes this means humanity and cry means anointed what okay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth in fact\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat no matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in San because of Adam's then because we carry out and then uh our entire life we we are and and even all that is that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nAnd north in security protects against online threats that if there's a

California is with us say Thomas\nGeorge thank you for taking my call sir Jeffrey great work that you're doing Jeffrey\nMy question is about war and the battle field in war zones how tell us\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica salt I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a wartime battlefield situation and you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a a place where negative spirits are attracted to demonic spirits negative stairs as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field methods\nThere are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy it is generated by other people fear around us which is natural and the battle situation\nUh emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are a lot of layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can take this stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening I read all of that stuff when I go to the service\nTen minutes in the morning and ten minutes and the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we need we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy of this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also ... off the fear\nAnd here so I think that it's very important\nThat we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what ... what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not have to say it's really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists do not call me up and argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy\nA person's life a hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money charge to get it out\nIf they destroy a business and they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home that can cause people to ...\nThey'd have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home that can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violently and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a field business\nI think of most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in her business after business comes in and you have problems of fields businesses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working or who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd the ... and can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired\nYou know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or a you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what's her picking up on George is emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy in the needs to be cleared out so\nThey attack businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go the Monique in some ... some ... California Hi Monique go ahead\nHi George I'm way that twenty eight million that guy to hack face\nThat they got you are oh his stand out and mysterious him and I have a couple of questions\nThat first one is regarding um mental illness schizophrenia now obviously there is a scientific reason behind it however who would say that\nPeople with this condition aren't seeing spirit turning around and I find it very interesting that so I'm On the back here and cost a lot about seeing God he's this and then and now they're\nSide will talk about demonic parrot here that's my first question the second question is I've been seeing numbers on clock\nAnd addresses a triple number for a while to work has had\nUm multiple gas talk about these annual numbers and George you said how do you know that it's not coming from a demonic or in most of your guests say on now like it's a good thing that I like now I'm ... now and then if you think that it is possible that\nI'm negative here it can come through you know by um number numerology yeah those are my two questions\nWell Monique a\nVery powerful negative spirits can affect people on a physical level that's very sad but it's also very

visit WWW dot Pamela ... dot com\nAll right let's get back to your calls let's go to Vicky\nVicky has a two thousand twelve Nissan\nVicky how many miles on your Nissan\nAlright and you've got a question about getting ready for winter\nYeah I I I lost my mentor Tony everything and I need to find out what about the air and why do I care about the oil it I have five twenty weight oil and\nAnd if they're an addict kind of crap I give her the weather coming up we'll be traveling north much colder\nOkay I was gonna say you're from the grass city a Grass Valley area in California correct\nAbout and we have very mild weather but I'm going north Oregon\nOkay All right a few things first of all uh\nOkay All right a few things\nFirst of all uh you don't put a lot of milder John Lewis he's having now is that going to change where you're going to put more mileage on is this going to be pretty consistent\n[laughter] okay what I recommend for people and it's just easier to remember rather than mileage\nIs change your oil with the seasons so in other words when the season turns change oil that's an easy way to remember it\nIf you change oil too often it's not going to hurt a thing if you don't change it often of often enough then that's where the problems come and so yes I Would definitely change or with the seasons now as far as your cooling goes there's some rules for that\nToo right you have a vehicle that's coming up on six years\nAnd ah when you age at that point regardless of miles that things like the cooling system should be flushed new Cohen should be replaced well we also change break fluid now it's also very important with abs systems electronics that are involved in selling a wage\nThat we need to ... you know have the break fluid exchanged and flushed out and the reason for that is because the brake flew to ... it will actually absorbs moisture in moisture will damage a lot of the components inside of braking system\nOr other items that we've changed and basically it's gonna be all the fluids even though the miles aren't there you probably want to service your transmission you also want to take a look at the power steering on you know the inspections here we go again to you have a vehicle up on six years old even though the tires may have enough\nOr tread on them left what happens within time the heat or creates a problem where the tires will become very hard and greasy so you have a attraction problem there and not also attraction problem but even when you come to stop\nYou know the hardening of the rubber tires will create a problem with stopping to so basically it's if you do all this now you're going to be set for for quite a while before anything or another probably\nAt least three years before you have to really look at that but here's what I'd recommend Vicki\nGo to your local shop that you'd like to go to and tell them that you want all the maintenance done the things that we talked about\nIf if uh if financially that's a burden for you what I Would do is have them do it in tears have the first part of it done the oil changed transmission fluid and the climate change and then you can do everything else waiter or as your budget allows but it this way you're staying ahead of it but\nHonestly you're going to go through a a big bill right now and then for about three years you'll not see much money spent at all and the key what we're talking about now is that so much about winter rising your vehicle\nFor the trip to to Oregon it's more about the mileage where you are now and she was asking about the the weights uses five W toward him that's great and that you can continue doing that to absolutely\nSo you're actually Vicki you're doing really well it's just a ... you're not behind anything but what you're at where you're at is you're at that time where it's going to cost you a little bit money we call it the sixty or Ninety thousand mile um checkup and so you're at that point right now\nBut once you do that then you're going to go like I said about three years before you have to spend much more money other than oil changes\nHave crashed okay when it came time here and it's ... to have elderly yes okay I heard on the editor healthier than the average finance\nYeah there is in fact if you ah requested wicks filters they have a terrific uh on most applications a long life filter in other words you could go longer and it's a bigger a capacity filters so it can take more debris before it goes into a bypass mode\nAgain it switched filters W ... that's up to you yeah I bet if you're doing normal you know seasonal changes not a lot of mileage really they're probably\nOkay yeah I don't have to worry about right and the only exception that I Would like to add to that if you were like in an area like in the east over here we have a lot a lot of cold and whatever you know that we recommend that even with short driving because of the condensation that'll forming a crank ... in ... in your case though\nYou know if the temperatures are always like in the sixties quite a bit and they stay pretty moderate\nYou may get by with not maybe going by you know just just look at it maybe some of the cold seasons you know maybe October to December then of course January on\nBecause that's where the compensation and the moisture never burns out for it he's going back and forth\nYeah and it's easy to remember to do it with the seasons when they need it or not you're absolutely right that you can save money that way\nBut let's make it easy to remember just do it with a Z and don't worry about the\nThe oil field or that they give you 'cause you're not driving a lot of miles and you're changing it regular with that for us if you were using a full synthetic oil and trying to get as long as you can on an oil change swimming like thousands and we're ... and was talking to a year or that's when you go into those high capacity oil filters\nIf you're doing it the way we're suggesting to do it four times a year just put a normal oil filter on its plenty big\nThe four times a year just put a normal oil filter on its plenty big to take care of those ... between three thousand or three months\n[noise] you know can make it simple you\nAll right well you know our number anytime we can help we can be your ah we can be your advisors\nThat's not All right take everybody have a great trip to the great state of Oregon [noise] All right let's go now to Scott Scott had the two thousand eleven Kee ah Scott how many miles on your key as\nA guy a bottom line is six dollars an hour\nOr an today you're calling us about what\nA while I'm On my car which are just about every other day um when I tried to show it up like when I go back to start the car\nThat's hard starting you know normally a crank out very well starts right up it's hard to start when I get it started it doesn't want to do so I got a son or on the gas pedal for a little bit\nLike a minute or two then it starts fine but very dry run out of fuel you know or filling up stop to throw it up\nAre gone as far as leaving Iran and what are you know it's not a not a great plan but I'm also starts to fight off on a lot still it\nOK Scott you have any check engine or services your lights coming on\nBut it's one that came on yeah\nOkay well it sounds like tennis you have a problem with the mission control systems are users two or three major components that can create this problem so if we have a problem will say for example within themselves and the ... what's happening when you go to refuel the vehicle\nIs that when you are gassing announcers fumes that normally are stored within the evaporates and there's a canister of charcoal canister that will actually take and recover the films\nSo then after you're done filling up what happens is that you start your car and then very slowly this purge valve will operate and it will slowly burn the fumes are ways in ... and then of course there's less\nLess hydrocarbons that end up in the atmosphere effect we offered saying about all those and also an action days you know not to fuel your car or you know specific temperature and whatever so what's happening is instead of the Steelers being held\nIn the special reservoir there going directly to your attention and then take manifold and so when the reality what you're doing is it's running that way because the engines flooded out so\nNext step is you need to have someone to look and read to see what that service coach staged and it's not gonna tell you exactly what's wrong it's going to lead you to the direction of repair in what circuits and uh once you make that repair that Dr ability a shift a diminishes go away\nAnd I got to tell you it's got that you may have caused this problem if you're going to your fuel stops and maybe you get a a a good deal on fuel and so you tried to stuff as much of it is you can in the in the fuel tank\nYou need to stop after the first click and ask for every body [noise] um I I'm really I'm known for doing that I Try to get every penny a fuel and and I eventually or hurt myself or the systems in the vehicle so don't do that Scott and anyone else that's fueling vehicles don't do that\nI Do very good shape to the call yeah\nI used to do that to do that anymore when it clicks on care where it is that's what I I used to see guys rocks their cars faster and more than a hundred and five an hour to get another sense on the gallon if we are the car show\nLet's say you're gear spotlight is brought to you by Walker products are leading manufacturer of quality fuel system components an engine sensors vehicles are being pushed to new heights with increased fuel economy and fewer tailpipe emissions\nWhich has created the need for a smarter and more sophisticated exhausted after treatment system featuring an array of sensors designed to monitor and control the different aspects of the cooperation and help the AG tea or exhaust gas temperature sensor plays a major role\nThe engine rpm should go up to maybe eleven hundred twelve hundred and they should drop down to seven fifty a that they'll pay and then when you place it in drive or it should still stay at seven fifty do you know if it ever drops below seven hundred and fifty\nYeah it'll it'll be at six fifty sometimes you know like in ... and just sitting there neutral or maybe as I go to back up so I got to watch that I leave it on because it tells me right what you know what may happen has happened\nHere's what you need to do you need to have the fuel system cleaned you're going to have to have the throttle body cleaned the mass Airflow censor ah upper induction system and if you do if you were around that mileage points where there's a hundred thousand miles on sparked ones which are going to want to do is do this aggressive cleaning\nAnd then after the cleaning gonna wanna probably drive it for a week or so and ... changed and so we don't want to do is to replace spark plugs and contaminated with these chemicals for cleaning the system you'll find out after the cleaning most\nChemicals for cleaning the system you'll find out after this cleaning\nMost likely the stalling problem will go away because you haven't mentioned anything about a check engine light and uh you should watch though again you know a lot of people don't pay any attention to it but you should really you know when he started you watch it goes up to twelve hundred should hang in there a little bit and slowly creep down in many cases\nYou may not even see that rpm change which is an indication that the throttle body and the fuel systems extremely dirty\nOkay I Do get a service steering system okay the slant on now here we go again we're running out of low idle speed and if you're running at a low idle speed\nThat can create that problem too because the engine rpm isn't that fast keep in mind that every time you make a turn the power steering pressure switch kicks cinder loading everything down you've got your air conditioning on you've got other components that put a load on the engine\nSo what's the computer sings at the engine rpm are too low so that service code may go away when you resolve the problem with the engine idle speed or you know running a at warm temperature in dry it should always read about seven hundred seven hundred and fifty\nRight okay and someone says like the there's a switch and the steering system or something that needs to be replaced\nNow know that actually tells you that it's working because what it's doing its commanding it should be commanding the computer to increase anytime you put a load the attorney AC on the engine rpm should go up you turn the steering wheel the computer takes oh anytime there's an rpm drop it should increase it\nBack up you have the uh is that what they're talking about is the transducers or or switch whatever you want to call it but if that weren't working then you you really know and it would have happened all at once we think that it's a long term thing and now you're just at that point where now it's really critical and you need to get everything cleaned and bring it up to\nAnd after that it's all done one of the things that come to mind to as you if you had the idol speak control motor that's no longer working a correctly or that could be the cause of it too but you still want to have the cleaning done in as to cleaning has done that will help the idol speak control motor work to write the milk it\nOften is called like a major cleaning or what his or her now feel injection cleaning\nYou know you can happen to there's an induction system cleaning and the fuel system Clinton you want both performed and what's often forgotten about on the on the back of your car's fuel filter up underneath makes sure that's changed also\n... ... okay okay All right great great thank you very much\nAlready have a great day thanks for calling us here on the car so we're going to take a break in a moment but before we take the brake we've got James with us and oh three Ford Windstar a James you're having a problem with the drivers door electric window described the problem real quick before we take a break\nOut the stopped going down a law that pushed it down and let it run up and down and then that happened a couple of times and\nIt went down\nRegular job right\nNow yeah most likely the window motor has failed so you need to have the window lift motor replaced\nSo a new window lift motor for that door yes and how much is that going to be all depends if he takes it somewhere probably about two hundred and fifty dollars signs and that will take care of the problem and you won't have to worry about fact with more calls in a moment\n\nOctober his fault
