P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile with a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build a huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes they have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what so that that's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter light ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and your cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border of\nWhat was it that made you and strong um or realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nThe clue that there is another planet out in the solar system really came from looking at the very most distant objects\nOr system really came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun\nWell beyond Pluto big travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly around the sky is the fact that they're all off in this one direction\nAnd only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headlines in October twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects that being swept off my whatever the massive look called planet nine that you discovered in twenty six team\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you need to people who ask questions about rogue planet and\nThey ... through the ana knock ears Marion and all of that because it does come up a lot what exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers that didn't seem galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planets\nAnd they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out\nThe smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one and in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could have been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why some thing now says like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on her knowing\nIf something like the ... I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for\nThe past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out how Pluto out in the ... rebel what would be the obvious observation all changes ... nation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers in an apartment in the planet that we know of planet nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun than the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so it's a fact it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii and November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible that talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for just\nThe way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data\nIt was for just the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks\nTo months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know within a month or two of collecting those data and then to that point we'll announce the existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nSo there you have a Oregon right from the man who\nDiscovered this uh in terms of those ... nations of those half a dozen bodies that are all kinds of gathered together out where the guy prevailed in the\n... cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing this research project with these scientists is that I had no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat was trying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system from a mercury\nThe sun and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and urine is our because Pluto or been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity and that it\nIt would have impact on every single thing and so\nThat's when we would have loved those Zacharias itching to than to live to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion a face to face eye\nTo eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nShe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive planet but when you read let say about the ... through scholar and do the translation that we're a car and done\nAnd you

George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nYou know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world when it really kind of waking up seriously for the first time the global climate change\nAnd real Pancho dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of expanding methane and carbon dioxide\nMight get around the yard and at the United nation many countries especially to worry about Iran and the level right flat and white population they came together on the interim government help\nElections they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the eye PCC and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the ICC PCC committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels\nThe October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't if our planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn there will be a catastrophe of math die offs they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral weather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will caused famine and fighting over land food and freshwater\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island to coast populations to move\nBut to where\nThe twenty Eighteen I PCC reports said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity\nCoal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or the PC the report says quote there's kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington\nWhich seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist\nBut this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen ...\nHe is professor drew Janelle PHD professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nation in the world that are now island and other places that are most impacted by the whole right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries in large part of why we have this new report those countries want to the United nations to investigate a lower woman target thinking that two degrees was probably not sufficient to\nProtect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also older you've seen the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lawyer in countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population village very close to you know Nigeria has huge popular cheese burger she level but you know so does most of the world and the United states also has an enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nAlaska you have an interesting problem where it's ... nations luxury sea levels and melts the ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the wage can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the buried street area many of them are already having to be evacuated and moved\nGround or smoke so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nSo it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe that the combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground\nYeah and he is that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere is not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events now becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to after the evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places\nThere's an island doesn't have to pay for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it has already gone\nThat we've seen the water come up through the drains in Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding that were very rare it's become so commonplace that governments have had to put a marker so that motorist can see how deep the flooding is it's so routine and Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of street in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level rise has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both of Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just a decade ago and dump more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models\nAnd then watch the models have often been too conservative and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of what had been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of sea ice in the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models protective\nYes the Arctic can melted two to three times faster than the computer's projected already by twenty eight team that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWhere we've been observing from satellites that\nMelting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating so that is definitely a worry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become destabilized\nBased on say melted and from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the boat you know when we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather event between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability of drought greater likelihood is high fire conditions\nAnd receipt flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events\nAnd the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd will even the heat extremes going up in metropolitan areas around

I don't think I've ever seen one\nDo you see anything in the I\nI don't remember the ... it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in partying something to me because I wasn't afraid\nIt was almost like it was giving the instructions very strange I don't remember a voice it was almost as if it was ... ethic\nAnd that the being the praying mantis essence seem to be blowing like a sure why\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was very white you could tell that it had a lot of texture\nYou know if it was white it had like ...

I just had the ... that maybe they were doing something with me to recover sperm or something\nBased on everything that you have experience with the praying mantis what would you speculate could be humming further\nI think everything is speeding up now\nSomething is about to happen that's the feeling I get I get this feeling of urgency I get this feeling of it's too late to do anything about our

overlay the appearance of whatever the white us we'll call it ... smokers smoke he thought that his period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff and that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night\nOn my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck the an experience or meditate or had they had any insights about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six [noise]\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science we said that he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause the nominees and tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex all seem to be going that every single question is leading the answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information

made me up the lever that we are not aligned and it began\nHi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty\nI within my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to only\nNow from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any town boy like that and him as a child and hotter tend to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nWas about four years of age I live with my mother and she had a best friend that she live within two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment\nAnd it's two levels you have to go up to stay here as we get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms\nAnd I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just they earn it in the dark\nAnd go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet but I didn't hear any cars that's how I knew it was very late at night 'cause I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up\nLook up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between the apartments\nAnd so I look up and I see a light a bright light in the sky high so it was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky\nI noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground\nThe light that I was looking at came down it was an or what I noticed about it was\nOne half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert and then they have they closed the neon green glow sticks right\nLook like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it wouldn't be any that were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle the salt white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in assault Hawaii began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was trends and you can see through it\nYeah I could clearly see food it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood balloon so the and it's like you're looking at a seafood for long I'm going to be seen\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall of white part wearing like down and he's looking up he's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what he's\nLooking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that that is a person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from this\nIs the only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out this grieving go down there you go on a beach\n[laughter] you know ... ...\nThat's what I was like man I wanted to go but mom's going to be you do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand that the key is the significance of this\nOkay this is very close to you if you are looking out his window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of the circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man dispersal\nThey should not have happened to myself I was thinking man this personal looks like God\nThen I

color of his eyes\nNo I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd ... was the shape of the down\nFrom what I could see it look like get pulled over his head that all look like once wallet piece and they went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his feet in this your uncle\nCraft no I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his feet\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was ... it

fascinating to me is when you think about the biblical pictures that we've seen paintings yeah almost all the characters and figures have horrors around their head wish for lunch with\n... yeah sparkly gold often\nThat's true what is this and I don't think that it is something being made up I think it is a physics part of the universe and other dimensions that we had been denied or have never been told or ever educated about\nIt's always been a thrown into the bin of methodology or something else\nAnd that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new cosmic understanding of the physical relationship between them now the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram you would have to be projected from another dimension\nMore and more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions\nAnd if we cycle if this so is the important part and at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not all souls we'll go to the same dimensions\nThan recycling back into matter universes\nHas to be a huge and common

walked where I have been where Anna mutilated animals are\nNow what I'm trying to do is set a a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet is well\nThose animals sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence that is today in the twentieth and twenty first centuries\nAre doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do an animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular\nI think that there are many facets I think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the hell does it make it self front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet and the solar system\nNow that doesn't the fed and humans being cruel to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible\nBut I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human creature\nThat we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is until all of us know all of the truth\nThen animal mutilation and human abductions and all of this facets which seemed very disturbing may not be understand ... be understood in a correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting\nAnd that is why I feel so

you very much for having me\nI Want you to tell ... audience that will truly be very sympathetic with you tonight exactly what happened to rough because this story so important for so many people to understand\nA much starts let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes for Ralph was a vibrant young man with no\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City it was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... or ... G. L. A. and the generic version of it that ...\nThis is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\n[noise] would you see begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like distilling this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ross took his life\n[noise] over the course of a early in twenty Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt tea was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there as he passed away\nHow old was he just he was twenty [noise] and how does he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful\nBut on the last attempt a he used a gun and at that time I wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marking over a year but the tax came to me at exactly eleven eleven\nAnd that's where we are going to talk about tonight the cities that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was it was shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... my biggest nightmare of course as a parent to lose your child before you go\nAnd I could only what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain but the synchronous cities then started so tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty two which is the name of your book\n[noise] well I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nWant to tell our audience this ... year when I was talking with John several weeks ago about the situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred now you mentioned that you don't use the sun roles\nUm was you know just a delightful young guy and use the name Gabriel of course you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph's middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they unison that one is and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um\nIn that it was symbolic was spiritual and has brought me significant meaning\nAnd on and I was talking to Jonathan and I said my dad's name was ... and uh you know he was born on February twenty seconds which is the same date that Ralph\nWas born in these weird synchronous if you started coming up all over again and Jonathan's eyes just opened up and and everything else do you believe that your son is Cindy ... messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding [noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute\nThere's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study a I've been studying the ancient couple a text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that the infinite ... is communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think ...

you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really

passed on Jonathan\nI Know how this was a tragedy or how were you doing now\nWell George I'm I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really helped me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise]\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought in thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infant its own were each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\n[noise] I have to say that I I question that\nDidn't think about it much and\nEver since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really didn't get to the second book three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers which whatever they're\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me and a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it off and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love that about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret and then you had an occurrence with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me turn the lights back\nWith the light switch back down put it back up put it back down and went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked that many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I have struggled\nTo try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nWell they're they're protected by law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was ... subject to depression\nJonathan was was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\n[noise] know Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask because friends they would portray just the most on us\nUm you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nAnother ... go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay at home they take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital\nI I think I think he was vomiting proof usually there was a lot of blood was out with his friends who are all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\n[noise] well I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questions story Hi Patty\nHi ah I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to a ...

to understand\nA but let's start let's start from the beginning he was a vibrant young man what happened\nYes Ralph vibrant young man with no medical history whatsoever was admitted to\nMedical history whatsoever was admitted to the University of Missouri Kansas City prestigious six year bachelor degree empty program were children graduate and six years with a BA in an empty\nAnd after completing the first year that program he got food poisoning [noise]\nWent to a hospital in Kansas City\nIt was administered very controversial drug by the name of ... or ... G. L. A. and the generic version of it at ... this is a black box drug that was used as a first line of defense or something like food poisoning\nAnd from the moment that drug was injected within days Ralph both physical and mental condition began to deteriorate and there are many many many cases of this that can be found on the Internet\nAnd when you see begin to deteriorate physically and mentally did you notice that change with him\nAbsolutely within a day or two he and one of his medical school room mates had done research\nAnd the changes I noticed or his anxiety began to increase he began to complain of strange pains that he had never had before and this began a slow deterioration that I Would call something like distilling this whole lot of the human body\nAnd at this point Ross took his life\n[noise] over the course of or\nEarly ... Seventeen he was I brought him back home to St Louis and uh he made three attempts on his life\nTo take themselves out of this horrific condition that was bringing him intense pain and from what I understand the form of anxiety times a hundred [noise]\nUm and on his last attempt tea was successful and um I did hold his hand and was there and he passed away\nHow was he just he was twenty [noise] and how did he take his life\nHe tried with two other attempts that were unsuccessful but on the last attempt ah he used a gun and at that time\nI wasn't there he sent me a text that really began the marking over a year but the tax came to me at exactly\nEleven eleven\nAnd that's where we're going to talk about tonight ... cities that have occurred for you especially after this tragedy occurred I mean I remember being in St Louis when I heard about this\nAnd it was it was shocking situation for anybody to have to go through a ... my biggest nightmare of course as a parent to lose your child before you go and I could only what you were going through at that time with this kind of pain\nBut the secret new cities then started she'll tell us a little bit about the name Institute and the twenty to which the name of your book\n[noise] I I looked at that tax George again and again and again and in some way I found solid and connecting with that last tax\nAnd as I began to stare at it again and again it occurred to me eleven eleven well Ralph was born on two twenty two [laughter] and so the number twenty two began to resonate with me a firm that was the beginning point I Would say of that resignation\nWant to tell our audience as little secret is the year when I was talking with John several weeks ago about this situation in his book and of course the tragedy that occurred you mentioned that you don't use roles\nUm was you know just a delightful young guy and um [noise] use the name ... of course you took that name as well did you not\nI did Ralph's middle name was Gabriel and so I changed my middle name to Gabriel I felt they unison that one is and doing that it was symbolic was spiritual and um has brought me significant meaning\nAnd that was talking to John ... and I said my dad's name was ... you know he was born on the twenty seconds which is the same date the roles\nWas born in these weird ... started coming up all over again in ... and everything else do you believe that your son is sending messages Jonathan through these strange occurrences\n[noise] I I Do believe that I I've always been a rational analytical regimented person and in my personal life in my profession and Avi aiding [noise] and\nLife in my profession and Avi aiding [noise] and\nWith the pain of what happened\nIt began to open up my thought process and I said wait a minute\nThere's just got to be more and I took down the wall of what was my personal rationality and began to read I began to study I've been studying the ancient couple a text in Hebrew I've looked through other religions and mystical world\nAnd I do believe that the infant it's\nIs communicating with me\n[noise] what message do you think Ralph is trying to pass on to you what does he want you to know\n[noise] I find comfort in knowing that he's letting me know that the existence of him has not the best\nLife on earth for him has seized but the existence in the cosmic soup if you will does not stop and that has brought me tremendous comfort\nI I was going to say you must you in a very strange way of course to give you the kind of comfort to know that his existence continues that he's out\nThere somewhere or trying to get you little messages every once in a while just to make you aware that you know hey Dan I'm here\n[noise] [noise] well you know it it hasn't been always once in a

minutes\nBehind all I had to look at it a few times but it was twenty two men\nAnd do you get behind the car and you look at a license plate did you see twenty two there to do these numbers pop up all over the place\nYou know they do pop up to me and at times I think they're popping up and at times I think they're not coincidences so I really created a word for myself coincidences I'm calling them coincided NCIS\nBecause as a recent trip to Los Angeles and I'm thinking a lot about him and hotel I check into and they hand me a key and I walk up to the room and the room number is to twenty two\nJeeze random they just give it to correct you you didn't request it [noise]\nBut I don't think it's random I'm I have removed random from my thought\n... yeah I mean there might be random on the

son ... cities that have occurred since rough tragically passed on\nJonathan I Know how tough this was for you when this tragedy occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with how I think\nTo me is to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability [noise]\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much\nAnd ever since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really didn't get to the second one three stranger courage to want to go through each one explained to us what happened tell us about the ... which what happened there so about\nEight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want and he looked at me and a very strange stare and\nSaid I'll just tell them Ralph set it looked and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said\nWhere did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said\nNo she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloon what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\nI didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets time she and then you had an currents with some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nThe light switch back down put it back up put it back down they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house and just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I\nHave struggled to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizens\nWell they're they're protected by law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was roles subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student or frequently making jokes he was just if you ask his friends they would portray just the most on us\nUm you know likeable young man you could you could think of\nNow did you go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay at home they take some stuff uh you know they go to the bathroom and often they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms\nYou have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the\nHospital I I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood coming out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that call\n[noise] [noise] well I got the call after medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your Jonathan let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to this synchronous cities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at\nUm it started with my son ah who incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection\nThat we can look back for each other on that he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born and from there the synchronous cities just roll in um\nUm we were both born nine fourteen which were nine fourteen fifty two it was nine fourteen sixty eight every number we have to do it this is not a nine I mean ... fourteen or a seven or its divisible by seven\nYeah um so you get certain numbers as Jonathan gets twenty two you get certain numbers popping up all the time too\nYeah exactly well uh you know the first thing was we noticed my initials or P. R. R. P. um his mom name was Donna I'm my dad's name is Don ... answer\nDr parents are exactly the same age as my parents to the air and the month July Nineteen twenty nine and November Nineteen thirty one and I mean that kind of blew me off my socks\nShe pending let me ask you like him why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on the sixteenth birthday huh OK okay uh it was it was better for him and me I understand that happened\nThat way and I mean it was it was excruciating to let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one in synchronous these out of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther at is is is he still with us\nOh absolutely OK yeah he he lived with\nMe for seven years and they moved back to his home state of Utah and um we were both born on an air force bases hey it didn't this hatred yesterday's and they're beyond coincidence\nEventually when ours was done for like astrological star twins\nAged son Kenny ... in one again John what you call coincidence\nI call them coincide and says I I Believe that we all have these we just have to tune ourselves into them\nNo question about reality now\nYou know there are things is I don't believe in coincidence is either I think the steps in and things have a purpose and the reason a shirt sometimes there's luck and strange occurrences

P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three nine ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to help shore are there other states\nMaybe you're in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that [noise] that's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program to the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world's silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get excited\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think it's about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWell why is it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there and the first place\nYou have the clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto\nThey travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly around the sky's the fact that they're all off in this one direction\nCan only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October\nActually and that what the new headline in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects that are being swept off my whatever the map says look called planet nine that you discovered in twenty six team\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you have to people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through a knee Anna knock ears Marion in\nAll of that because it does come up a lot what exactly are rogue planet how can planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planets\nAnd they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get past quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could have been completely ejected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something NASA like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nIf something like ... I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally I'll read the headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the telescope for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nSomething ten times the mass on our her where even out ... played out in the ... ... what would be the odd the observation all changing perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers in the inner part meaning the planets that we know of planning and has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet and the solar system and nobody sits around and he's worried the Jupiter suddenly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so it's a fact it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that it's just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii and November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible that talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers or just\nThe way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce existence\nAs soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there and then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world weight\nAnd then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's

said that he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is

Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child\nI Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five or Nineteen sixty six\nI was in my bed one night and I had woke up and could not go back to sleep\nHere now from Winston Salem North Carolina to tell and his own voice what stunned him as a child and hot it tends to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nI've lived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she live within two bedroom apartment my mother had two children\nAnd my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment in ditch to levels you have to go up the stairs we get to the bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brothers\nAnd two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just in the dark and go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of the bed and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet here in the cars that's how I knew it was very late in life because I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up\nLook up in the sky you know just looking around 'cause it was really the grassy field in between the apartment\nSo I look up and see a lot of light light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light than I was looking at it because it was the only thing in the sky\nI noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert and they have the glow sticks to me on green glow sticks right\nLook like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but there's so little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nCircle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed that in order to lights met in the middle the shah white lie in the lime green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall Hawaii began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a balloon so the and it's like you're looking at the seafood for long and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing in front of the fall white part wearing like down and he's looking up\nHe's just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what are you looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself look at that that's a person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from this\nWeek that the only reason I didn't climb out the window that night was because I was like if you knock out the screen and go down there you have a lot with you on a beach\n[laughter] you know\nWhat I Would freak out white man I wanted to go but bombs going to be if I Do this you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand it as a kid with significant for this\nOkay so this is very close to you as you are looking out the window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this is the conversation I was having to myself I was thinking man this person looks like God and then I thought I'm not going to say that uh let's see actually pills you need to go out and

talking about the bombs by the way are going to be joined at nine thirty five by Todd would former\nAir force pilot a national security columnist for the Washington Times and the editor in chief of ... dot com it'll be talking about the national security aspect and getting into\nThis interesting theory now\nTo understand a little bit more about me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in in what was Soviet Studies at the time that Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union ah what's going on there and the U.S Russia relations is a an area of great interest to me\nUh and in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor a and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about water and putting them ... ... ...\n[noise] and it's interesting because she said to me and and this is always stuck with me while I'm a ... does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWhen a lot of reporting cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength and our Democratic Republic\nTo use those against remember what am I putting some martial artist or and so when he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive\nIs like to use a a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact they don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that the so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know it or what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually a tax possibly by a a potent cronies for event I I ... anti pollutant stances\nHe he specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting\nSort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting I have it you're you're the Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operations to design to do what's happening now more of this you know I think so in some ways we shouldn't rule out of me and I I really think it's a very strange moment and we have no idea where it\nComes from we have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything that timeline had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the horizon again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all the episodes from happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nAnd negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this\nAnd so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it was an remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked the we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what ...\n\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five forty war that is the number taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew longer I Am sitting in for ...\n\n\nIf you last week to get the genuine sunspot correct or for free for sunspots age thoughts and even read inflamed patches Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny cellphone spot for after she says it's her go to product every day she had sun spots in eight spots can definitely see a difference in her skin since using it\nUm and and given the fact that there are Russian soldiers that are being killed on the ground in Syria isn't there even the barest possibility that this could be an FSB operation a given that the timing of all this or is the time and just to type for it to be that kind of an operation\nWell it is possible I mean what they just break nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah field several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that at this point in time\nYou know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters all over the ... former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this item treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can eliminate us on that\nBut what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what is it what does that mean and and how ... what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by ... on the IMF treaty pullout\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person to is against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the court and it's sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time I suppose that carry this\nTime I visited so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he what I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can\nKeep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThey tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with it ... them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia\nBring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the Andrew my anger show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what those are in them dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy the language I learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a gun to talk more about this because I was just so we've studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to rush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the pot a show dog teams on a show\nSo much but my my question a lot of the people what they don't understand is that is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire and and you're exactly\nRight until the end of things like me\nWell thank you but you got ... as I Do spend Superbowl sure claim that a little bit explain explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a port roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they set the ... he's a really half the world with their economy on their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union pitch to them that destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want that happening here so we write a lot about\nI mean this is this is why this is changing stand some means of the Russia is so important I mean\nThe the idiotic Russian ... said that ... then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths not quite that but the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and ...\n... said that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual ... the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strength that fact quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion of the bombers or their their entire than a stretching on down the ones that clue to do with Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at the uranium so you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was interrupted interaction with the Russian security services about Iran and has been a stretch it against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to be\nTaught how to
