process for remote viewing may be a danger to you that that dangers\nBeen there all along anyway I I'd like to add something to that when I I this is Joe I I agree with what when and uh Paula both said\nI've never had a bad experience and remote going but I Would like to uh underscores the fact that uh this is a very interesting um\nExperience remote doing or being psychic and there are a lot of people that are that are on the edge to start with and when they're exposed to the changes their rather radical changes in their their beliefs or their construct or it can be very undermining or damaging to the psyche\nAnd uh there is evidence that a lot of people do sort of step off the edge and lose touch with reality in other words they become a pretty much in in a involved there\nAre caught up in the the irrationality of it are the uh they lose their stability or their ability to deal a skeptically with the material and what's going on\nHow many of you want a remote viewing or any target ever since or a cell or understood there was not another remote you are I'm In the area so to speak in other words have met another remote viewer\nAh yes oh I did on on several occasions made a a now let me preface this by saying that uh there was never any proof\nBut in several sessions did generally at random I met a Chinese remote viewer oh oh and I'm\nActually over a period of time of several meetings are sort of struck up a a very good relationship there however there's no proof of that I never got feedback on it because of course we never knew\nA or\nAnything about the project or if there was a project or who the remote viewers were for China and so forth\n... would it be\nThere's we're for China and so forth\nWould ... would it be your view they are probably still a is still have a product of that sort either in China or Russia\nOh this is this is Joe I can respond to that I can say most in faculty that uh there are a number of countries Russia China hungry or\nA ... a number of other countries that are very heavily involved in pursuing remote viewing and ah researching it uh it would be silly to suspect that they weren't using it for a the obvious reasons but it can be used for\nMhm [noise] uh then for that reason uh above all the others I've I've heard so far yet again it's so hard to imagine that our own government would not do it knowing there are others out there doing it uh so if I had to make a guess I'd say we're still doing it but you guys they know\nWell this is Paul I'm of course anything is possible you know um there's quite an extensive security a secrecy in infrastructure and the government and it it is of course feasible that maybe there is\nStill somewhere very deep inside Langley or some place a program [noise] um\nI also like Joe I I I've actually made increase of of some contacts I have fairly deep in the system\nAnd as far as they've been able to determine there's nothing going on and that I can actually believe that uh just knowing the attitude of many of the very influential people out there in the government who disapproved hardly the program I can believe that that that it's been written off\nNot because it didn't work but because they were not comfortable with it\nWell then this is a very serious national security question if China and Russia and hungry in other countries are doing this shouldn't we be\nAbsolutely this is Lynn oh let me let me say that you're talking to the security people here and see her watch for words or when you ask this of a job while ago his comment was that he doesn't know of any\nUh I Would say the same thing how to say that no there is not er yes there is a I don't know of any and I said oh\nMy friends and contacts which are also very deep or don't know of any ah when people ask me about the uh closure of the project I say yes this project\nHas been fully closed and ah if they asked me about it and the others I very carefully word it by saying that the United states is the only country I Know of which has closed their remote you're\nPraying OK okay then let me carefully worded question could a ES the three of you knew of an ongoing project a here we are on the air ... could you say\nI wouldn't I wouldn't either [laughter] All right all that I Know that that helps\nYeah that's a ... and of course our answers might be different or otherwise as well uh I don't know exactly how it responds with\nMaybe no comment or something but uh but you know we certainly wouldn't reveal it particularly because we know a how important it could be we wouldn't want to jeopardize it that's right but the fact matter is that I'm pretty convinced both showing Lynn are the same with me we really don't know of anything going on and can indeed\nBelieved that it got the legs cut out from under [laughter] oh let me ask let me ask you something or\nYou know I I can understand your disbelief that\nThat somebody wouldn't be paying attention to this uh but I can tell you from experience that\nUh there there are actually people in the government in very high positions that believe that it's like still believe that psychic functioning are you sort of remote viewing is a violation of a of spiritual and the logic reasoning\n... in our ... and and uh argumentative way against that just based on religious grounds so how do you deal with people that are still holding\nWell I guess I Would ask you one Langley got religion\nWell I'm I'm not talking Miami's Nazi approval authority\nUh let me also ask a question here or are you asking is whether or not our government has done something stupid\n[laughter] I guess I Am [laughter] I guess I Am [laughter] I I think it might not be the first time it's happened [laughter]\nAll right outlook we talked a little while ago about remote influencing to the average person that's really frightening the ability to influence and others are thoughts or actions at a distance I'm so an obvious follow up question to that is\nA would there be a defense against an attempt to remotely influence\nIn ... and this is Joe let me\nThe temp to remotely influence\nOr this is Joe let me uh I had responded to that earlier in a there's an additional comment I could make in that regard\nA while there is evidence that there probably is a capacity for some form of remote influencing\nThe the problem has been that uh because of ethical in human years reasons uh whenever those experiments are done you have to inform the person the targeted individual that they're participating remote influencing experiment\nAnd as long as those particular rules were in existence would be taught them out to impossible to know whether or not remote\nInfluencing is actually taking place as a result of\nA a unknown targeting or whether or not by virtue of fact the person knows they're involved in that kind of experiment there actually are willing you willingly opening themselves to being targeted\nSo it it's an issue that probably won't be answered and kill someone has come about a with a an approved protocol that in target individuals without them knowing or on wedding targeting\nWell there's a lot of a sudden going on now about influencing of a different sort of by the Chinese with regard to our present administration and one would have to imagine if there is a Chinese project\nAndrews remote influencing is possible that would have been an obvious uh a major ah project or would you all agree\n[noise] a little ahead oh I I I Would agree except that I haven't seen any evidence that the Chinese are in fact going nuts so it's sort of a moot question and I'm not sure how anyone would would evaluate the results of the [noise]\nYou know there have been this is Paula there haven't been a lot of reports about the Soviets having been involved in that in the past um but it's mostly kind of rumors and and and such a again no evidence of course the thing of this nature it'd be hard to prove anyway\nBut there were some interest in what wild stories about what the Soviets could or might be doing\nAll that there are All right gentlemen hold tight we'll be right back to you\nGathering of eagles I'm calling in Linda Buchanan Joe's model and Paul Smith all involved in projects\nStargate for the U.S government which ran for Twenty years using your tax dollars\nI'm art bell listening\nTo our drill somewhere inside denied featuring coast to coast am from march ... Nineteen Ninety seven\nIn a dams case um I Would rather not comment directly on him [noise] but uh I I don't choose valid reason for what he may or may not have done that I\nI'd like to kind of when a little bit on its defense here um\nI think trees is too strong a term here a treason implies that you're providing a damaging information to unknown enemy or it didn't do that um he was\nYou know in the various ah Venus and when she released whatever information they did um\nHe was perhaps you know I don't know what his motivation was but he he didn't intend for that information necessarily to be used by an enemy or or uh or someone who wish to harm the United states you know of course by releasing it publicly you lose control of that information\nAnd you don't know what you saw it will be put to well that still doesn't constitute treason and\nLike oh let me ask you something or do you know of any country in the world that doesn't have a a open source literature a office I'm In San Marino has has little guy that sits in a building you know\nRight and and and you and and the point I made was once you've said that you don't know who's going to hear it but in Tempe as part of the the definition of treason if you intend to a release information to unknown enemy\nThat's treason if you're just spinning it out or maybe that stupidity or maybe that's a lack of care or something else but it's not treason\nAll right and to be clear or none of you use the word treason treason was the word used\nTo in in the facts or perhaps a reasonable interpretation or not reasonable of a of of the\nOf release classified materials um so we'll leave that they're on with this now a aren't please ask Paul Smith if he's ever RV aid to find out where the one hundred and sixteen last pages\nTo find out where the one hundred and sixteen last pages when I'll for your information it's more of a thing that's from Iran and running amount of time [laughter]\nAnd as a matter of fact no I haven't a part of the problem with getting is you can't task yourself\nIf you do then you're already asking for trouble off you know you you know what the target is and you already have preconceived ideas about target if you say oh I'm going to go remote view acts\nThen you're very likely to find that that's what you expected to find whether or not is really their um even if I were interested in um you know going into these historical things and and are looking at uh all the past historical events dealing with you know my religion or any other religion\nUm if I were to task myself and the information wouldn't be valid\nYou would have compromised yourself exactly alright I'm again ah it's inevitable or it deems has done something that will affect the entire remote you in community he has released orders about to um videotapes that purport to be able to teach the general public\nHow to remote view out a price far less than the average remote viewing course apparently caused the public gum\nDo you think is possible to teach somebody would that method and be what effect will that have a if any with so many people out there trying to remote view\nOh this is Lynn I Am hoping actually that it does work because uh I Would love to see this talent brought out in and more people and I think overall would you know raise the entire conscience ness of humanity oh\nI Know that in my own philosophy of teaching\nOh I find that every student is so individual mhm that I'm very adamant about a individualized training oh and I know that it is to however I think many of the a general rules\nOf remote view it as the basic rules of remote viewing can probably be taught that way and I'm very anxious to find out if a if it works I like I say I hope it does\n[noise] let me jump in here uh this is Paul I'm I I taught myself how to play guitar and it took me well I'm Still trying to master some of what we normally the elementary things to learn\nIf you have a a an accomplished teacher um it is possible to learn things on your own or with books or videos or whatever\nUm but it's amazing how much of a difference a good teacher will make some I kind of echo lens feelings whether it'd be great if it was just ... successful and I kinda wish it's a fair amount of success in producing equality video that\nThat uh that can help people learn but nonetheless a there's a lot to be said for having individual instruction a particular and something as a nuanced and as a as a difficult to grasp is is this a remote functioning and it was\nAll right I Would like this is Joe I'd like to add just one comment to that I'm Lyn\nLyn made a very good statement when he referred to talent\nI'm essentially a within the research side of things we've pretty much firmly established that uh every every living human being as a an inherent talent that are being ...\nA remote viewing of course any instruction remote viewing should be teaching the technology or the protocol or whatever the ... you know the uh approach should teach the appropriate protocol and while you can teach the technology you're going to be pretty much stuck with\nUh the inherent talent within the individual as it's split a there is no exist been proved that I'm aware of at least from a research standpoint that you can expand or or uh make someone more accurate than what they're inherent talent might\nBe All right this is an area where you all disagree isn't it\nI don't know facts I agree very much\nReally I don't know in other words it than the natural talents or aspect of it a ... is either very important or not very important\nUh I as far as oh this is land uh as far as learning to connect to get a conscious connection to that part of your subconscious mind which knows\nThe universe or the information that's out there oh that is that is extremely teachable how much of the out there your subconscious is able to bring in I think as a matter of talent and oh and\nYou know it like teaching a a a person to play the piano there are some people who have the same number of fingers as the virtuoso\nAnd people who have the same number of fingers as the virtuoso and yet will never\nBe in a concert hall or even though they can learn to play the piano and this is very much true or you can't expand what's already there I think the amazing thing is to most people\nHow much is there and uh most people who are learned the remote viewing or just astounded by the amount of ability that they have in the span\nAlright I'm you all have moved from the military program to the civilian program and I'm not really ask you about specifics that you are a targets that you've done as civilians so let me ask you about a couple of has anybody remote viewed slight eight hundred\n[noise] well uh this is Paul I I have um [noise] in fact I did it did that in support of the project that ... that I've done some freelance remote young per se tech\nUm and in fact uh the drawings that uh I forget what program and was on but the ones he showed it to the camera were were sketches that I had made in in the course of my sessions\nOh they were oh that was of the uh the I think it was a few pompous simply some\nSome kind of a piece of machinery equipment or of course I had not a clue what it was a you know I just do it [laughter]\nSo you then would a would agree with the major teams assessments ah that\nThat wasn't mechanical um malfunction\nWell my ... take care of a set of viewing didn't really identified the ultimate cause\nUm I I specifically honed in that piece of equipment that that was um whatever happened to that was a a a major contributor to the or perhaps the major contributor to the to\nThe incident was aircraft um what made that malfunction I didn't didn't\nGet that I don't know does that mean then that uh it is it that particular piece of gear it could have malfunctioned and caused the accident in quotes accident um or that a a missile or without a warhead exploding could have passed through and hit this and then caused the quote accident\nThat is possible at least based on my sessions now I don't know what other viewers or had had work that particular project and he may have had some other\nUm you know more confirmatory kind of stuff as ... as far as the actual initiate or of the event but my particular viewing didn't really confirm or deny\nA you know some third party involvement\nOkay you just came up with that particular piece of gear um what about O.

grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a you Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location\nAnd talk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us a fire and you don't know me but tell me about yourself\nThat that that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it it fast and you know you go back and look at the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era offered an upper class uh places and they would of you know a lady's day Crumpet the heat and the and you know they try to communicate with goats and then\nYou'd have to the spiritual era hum and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Kate Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then your hair your pricing has researching all that and then you ... for two of the the the the VP idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record to communicate with ghost through white noise and through your broken radio that switches channels and then you\nFast forward to whom the more modern day goes on with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough or spooky enough for even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to a spirit because\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in ... and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house I the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going sledding or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long\nAnd James is like you know post quick provoking quip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they're which that\nYou're not doing yourself in your favor thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is\nThey were there by ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is that the people are not evil or what it is that All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that same ugly\n[noise] ... there's a couple of things you know one of the first things you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone's have skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAny weird you know sound as that goes and so so that the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is\nWhat exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested repeatable right it it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and crazy TV [laughter] reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a so I've I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of goes hundred 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see is that go centers on TV you and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage what's called the nominally hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're ... they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... and the sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see the ghost hunter go into a location maybe there's a team of them and they'll you know they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else and then they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you whatever readings you get\nWhen you're walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is what I'm reading as you get over that six hours that there can be normal variation that that that's the only happens once a week or something\nDoes your dog it's scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro order and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we try to\nPick up two bottles of super bigger fish oil get the third bottle free packed with a mega three D.

I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are all this weird thing move a\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I went up there and investigators night I went and then I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talk to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect going to be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there something I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I Try to lift those\nAnd I tried to rank them in terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test where things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically you'd go to um west and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell\nAnd you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of\nImage this year she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nYou know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and try to replicate it you know take take take the photograph at the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might\nMight be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI sell ... and I get that I get that and you know I guess that\nThat thing whatever that might be in there like you said and it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of one of them\nAre going to say one of it is um you know if it's some one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where you\nKnow there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there's this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without\nMore information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one's looking into you know strange image to their left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't see the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya got ya and\nYou know it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see where the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle I'm\nJust\nYou know there's some things that are seen that he just\nNo way this shadow in and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked out that that's I mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame place was hunting for sure that you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now the new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost writers and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights are and all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting we're going back to hotel I said I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of ghost\nOr I mean even to this day and again this was you know six seven years ago said you know even\nThe the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or business not and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost\nThere's hundreds of fun and simple

Roswell but I still\nThe biggest thing to me Paul and in thinking for being here with us but the biggest thing for me Paul is all of these things now we've heard all these things before along the way all over the place\nYou know lucky you to be a ... right in the vicinity of all of this ... going on and we've heard a story similar with skin lock her ranch here in states um you know the Bermuda Triangle self the one that everybody all talks about\nAs well as you know Roswell itself and you're saying all these are just like that in the u._k. however the most interesting thing of all to me it ... it ... the other things aren't interested enough is again\nThese vehicles that show up that you got pictures of those that are in the area where something has happened and you know that the mystery to me somebody knows something right and they're checking it out\nWhile I Would think so yeah I mean it was it was kind of these drums with these huge unit on on the back of the trailer you know two people could have climbed inside this year when it's in the ...\nOr maybe it wasn't a military exercise but how strange that it just happened to coincide with all these little unexplained activity you know if you believe in Congo coincidences then go with ... I Believe that the ... have been something else to to this\nInterestingly I spoke on another radio show it on December the Eighteen or twenty Seventeen\nA quite a large one in the u._k. and well respected guy and he received some emails uh\nFrom among all been walking on the cliff talks at them and the week previous I traced it because of social media because there was a flash of light scene in the sky and people talk talked about it and he read these they read these out to live on a on the on the radio show and basically this guy is going for a walk\n... to put them to the wall too long the click talks in the night with two friends that dumb this wall before\nThat it took about an hour and a half and at some point during the journey back he said it was about ... states I Believe uh if I Know about the actual times writes forgive me because I don't have the paperwork in front of me but it was a huge flash of light in the sky blue type of thing will just put a blinking today lived the discourse forty could have been\nOn stilts have been cut on with that you are and they they should've been back at the ... to ... to see\nThat it was a things tend to when they arrived luck of the uh\nFor the call this period of missing time now I Know that the flash of light was talked about on social media I don't know this mom who come to the radio station I apps and spoke to him in exchange some emails that more choice he'd seen the military on the cliff talks he'd seen them with gold and I haven't seen them with ...\nUh and he he he mentioned various will debate so yes there is such a concentrated\nAmount of activity happening yet I don't think it is quite unique ... I think places like they say exist all over the world yeah yeah\nProbably fortunate on it but you know I'm fifty five years old so some people will be working you know in the day job quite a bit longer than that and I'm I'm fortunate that I I'm Still out for you know to to devote than most myself in the twenty four seven and that's what I'm doing\nThe vote than most myself in this twenty four seven and that's what I'm doing so probably I'm highlighting these things I'm no embellishing them a ... you know that I'm probably bringing all this stuff out because the people of these local villages you know the ... to them from the ...\nThe quite secular the very very secretive type of people not black people but they keep the cells to themselves\nYou know when the animals will be ... to ... some ... some months before\nIt anybody said anything never made the local papers the police are aware of it was over fifty shape being killed now as well as their about just an audible voice as we just discussed [noise]\nYou know but they didn't want to say anything they they just wanted to keep it to the cells ... unfortunate finals lifestyle is affected by in this particular area or said he got to do because it just couldn't afford not to for insurance purposes you know the place of being there with night show last night cameras\nA you know trying to find out what's responsible and another one is being done during the night and they've seen nothing\nIs once again it's it's an incredible area the states with salt to ancient earth works\nAnd there's a there always seems to be a link to these ancient areas not like I said previously the ancient people they knew about these places they might not have understood them anymore and we understand them I mean I don't profess to understand them ...\n...

friends and family they just sort of know that oh look and it goes again all\nRight [laughter] [laughter] they're like we're going to we're going to go to the beach and like that's really cool are you there is a monster assault on over there and people taking\nPhotos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere

or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um a a place called lake crescent\nHum and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know just Craig crevices and everything and turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot a metal sculpture thing for this thing as you enter the town and the town of the population is like three or four\nOr something [laughter] I worked as a car I'm like I put on the break but I got to the I I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that Frank I'm looking at all [laughter] that's great okay so\nI'm before I get along you know this week and I'm like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science I Googled that boom towns your article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're not the record that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com discovering you skeptical inquiry magazine\nAnd um and some others out there too but I saw this great article\nFrom you and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so so tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of Halloween\nSee this is ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders as well as we are going to come up\nWith this conversation I'll love it might make grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like\nOne of the things I Love about about you know to to\nTo be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists all the the the conservative from time to get a little touchy about that because they think it's really the the cult which not but if it was basically something that everybody can sort of jump into\nAnd that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history I'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick\nThese events and holidays there's not just one street lined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically you can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much um information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual ... meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice ... and it's a time when I'm you know the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying\nSo it had this connection to\nUh to darkness but it wasn't a sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them it was very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes this is the time to store it rains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world was especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the uh the barrier between them\nOn this day the the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would that would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh the spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnations of Halloween there was also that uh time it's porous\nAnd so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that were that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that\nThe that are for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future um and there would be a proxy and often times the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year\nOr oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitious about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would a deal with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was bobbing for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so those so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass and credit coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] so I Do it you know the midnight ride on\nWillfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own\nLittle outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you know 'cause\nI I get there are people\nThat say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it as fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think this fall whether I think an orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoon\nThat we would watch like which isn't the goblins and and the theory bond funds things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so\nHang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here\nBut what we have is a banner rapper with us he is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as coach the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis we hang in the you don't know what you might hear [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county will as here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford bend so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein side like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nOh you don't go to target and put on you know a bad man can we make me come out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a jacket\nI agreed and and and you know you know make a Jack o lantern and play a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associates course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly children ... and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids it wasn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the early\nA Celtic versions of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that um but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was to honor that the church a church members who have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills were wrong for the soul purgatory\nAnd so there was this it was interesting transition from\nAn early purely taken me a ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with ...\nAnd and again they were they're bringing a bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noises verse head to scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know 'cause we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... hundreds and\nEngland was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween for praying for the dead and this again the ties back into all souls day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day ah the soul of the word in purgatory you know there were there were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the the wealthier members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up\nOf course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and um but the how the candle at the land from the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they would these numbers go out for house to house so you know yes will pray for\nIf you're a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the soles ... don't you wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America um the turn of some sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nRead when that's when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it now move on [laughter] interests says Munch on along boil some pepper um so we're candy I guess I guess it alternative candy at one point in in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it was interesting because again the it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time\nThe the genders had pretty strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would praying away with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four teeth at the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did\nAre we had three or four of the time who knows 'cause that's what they did um but you know ...\nThat's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo if that was typically sort of a young man's you know ... the mystery of this young man's project in the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when a U.S as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's it that's a little that's a little a lot of outlandish for for a little too much work for these days so that's when the verdict came down to treats\nOr and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid a not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally only a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even like it was like some really tart apple I'm always like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together because they were there were years where you get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you read it you were brave enough to

I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders as well as we are going to come up\nWith this conversation I'll love it might make grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like that I Know I\nWant it to one of the things that I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists\nAll the the the conservative from time to get a little touchy about that because they think it's really the the cult which is not but if it's what it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of full Couric these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal it festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about it just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice\nUm and at the time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them it was very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people who are celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes this is the time to you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the uh the the the separation between the world's was especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry boat or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would a would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnations of Halloween there was also that a time as porous\nAnd so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when it would be for a time for prophecy so\nAnd I would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other world but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in Eighteen hundreds or there were different custom that were that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that the that are on for example woman on Halloween would be able to tell the future um and it would be the profit and oftentimes the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who died the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nAnd so all these sorts of another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and passing credit coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do I Do it at midnight\nRight on I Will if we think that's right will swing ... well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it it's fun I see it and uh I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think a fall whether I think of orange and black colors yeah I think a fake little cartoons\nThat we would watch like which isn't the goblins and and the theory fun fun things that's how I see it\nAnd it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here but what we have is a banner Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's Willis ... hanging thee you don't know what you might here too [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the ah great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nYou know you don't see any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mass can we make make I'm I'm Out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love at all [noise]\nAbsolutely no I mean that that's one of the you know that that's really what of course you have um although you know Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and really didn't become focused on Capitol Hill about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids are involved but it wasn't really a kid the kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again through if you go back to\nGo back to win and the the the early a coping for it which were very and the mystic and and again for dealing with the changing of the darkness\nAnd again sort of dealing with the the changing of the season the darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was to honor that the church a church members who have gone to heaven\nAnd then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills were wrong for the soul purgatory\nAnd so there was this there was it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan um um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influences the Catholic Church with all things in a whole day\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noises for such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know 'cause we were talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that a ... believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like handlers and whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise] um but then later on during the late Eighteen at least some hundreds\nAnd England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween for ... for the dead and this again the ties back into all souls day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day ah the soul of the word ... or you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell there needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthy members of the communities would basically a higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these ... and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and um\nBut the candle at land from the candle in it and the candles light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they were these members go out for house to house say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's\nA who's passed on the news you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the souls of the Bush wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\n[laughter] [laughter] that's\nWhen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating asked that came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on [laughter] ... salt pepper um so we're candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in that I write out these like you were talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean if it ... it was interesting because it because again the sort of ... things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because for what happened is that if you think about it you know again there was the the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time\nOr the the jitters had produced a strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would ah would pining away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four teeth at the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did um\nBut you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo if that was typically sort of a young man's you know usually the mystery of this young man's project in the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process in those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween\nThe thing so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when\nAh you know as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for a little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold and purgatory [laughter] that's it that's a little less a little a lot of outlandish for for\nThe little little too much work for these days so that's when this sort of came down to treats or and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally a capital okay and I like\nIt was it wasn't even that like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together since they were there were years where you get full science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the green and which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full side bars you know marathon bars and you get a handful\nYou're the only perimeter marathon learn that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's\nA ... you got a full one you got a phone line is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those were fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time [laughter]\nBut we would there was like one house and all these had homemade

weren't here talking to you I'd probably watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now or anywhere\nYeah Yup yup yup ever on all the producers were were watching that hey you guys are going on there now\nAre so well knowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff now another element and some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing\nThe tricks you know and all that kind of stuff and now what they do is they go into cemetery where they go into the woods or they go into you know the um\nUm houses down the street that nobody the abandoned homes or a ban in hospitals and things like that and they go inside of these places and they use the weed you board on Halloween Night or they or they use now all these different devices\nTo call upon spirits and goes now you have you have written quite a few books actually and you do a lot of writing and oh my gosh good for you I I despise writing that's why I like to talk\nFor life I'll just say that All right\nLet your let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences of now I find I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that uh people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go well why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know it's true what do you now\nKnow that was that was ... when a when I was researching my book\nThat was that was one of the things that I ah when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those it's basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact\nThe dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era up and up at today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that\nI mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know your lead to Macbeth banquet so there's there's there's there there's no shortage of go in and literature and history but you know typically\nGhosts were or if it's typically if people if you wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to\n... your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a year the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location\nAnd talk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us aside and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a\nRelatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back to look at the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era are often upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady's day Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou would have the the spiritual era [noise] um and you have people like Harry Houdini printed research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and Kate McGee Fox\nAnd and and they're you know their their stuff and so and then your hair your price and his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with goes\nThrough white noise and fruit based on a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast\nForward to to the more modern\nDay ghost wonders with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and what's real techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough or even scary enough when I Do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in ... and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a hunted how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going deep looting or looking up in the sky line I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and changes like you don't click provoking clip promoting and you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they're WhatsApp I said you're not doing yourself and your favorite thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is that it's evil or not evil or what it is at All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone's have skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAny weird you know sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what\nWhat exactly is is is going on there and the question is can we tested repeatable right is it is it is found that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v. and\nYou can look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v. and\nCrazy he the reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a soft I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of both 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see is that go centers on TV you and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage what's called the nominally hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're they're they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... and the sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're the ... the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are eat to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample location so for example you'll see a ghost hundred go into a location maybe there's a team of them and they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else and then they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal abnormal you need to know what's normal\nAnd you know whatever readings you get\nYour walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is what I'm reading as you get over that six hours that there can be normal variation that that that that you know only happens once a week or something [noise]\nAnd bought from go motorcycle you to Fifteen\nMinutes to purchase the ... [noise] ... [noise] and regret the gas station and some others you presented\nNumbers to the board [noise] would insult to injury you could've used those Fifteen ... minutes which are motorcycle insurance to going to go\n[noise] oh [noise] God fifty minutes good fifty percent or more on motorcycle insurance\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's coast to coast am Connie Willis here will is wean is what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also\nIs an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghosts and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well what's what's bringing back on year been we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I'm Wondering here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture\nA photograph and someone said this is his picture I took a you know some there's a lot of really great people out there that they really have things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what his photo shopped what is not photo shop what might just\nBe a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit\nAnd a piece of dust how the\nBetween ... or ... and Don how the analyzing photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that's that's a good question and I have to say that the um you know I I've I've probably looked at a two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm\nI'm a same with the triple ... [laughter] I'm the I'm the default recipient of of troop recover\nPhotos [laughter] usually means you dogs in Texas but I have to explain that to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the\nThe the ghost photos of them sent our our ... by sincere people who just photographs something weird and they yeah they're not lying there not ... not try pulling over on me they're like hey can I flew him\nThey're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise] um\nAnd so you know I I go into each case um you know trying to you figure it out and to help them as best I can and so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you know I I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to\nDenver [laughter] researcher goes photos much why not [laughter] because because I haven't trademarked Willis lean and got in the world is often [laughter] split it with me that's all I ask you know as a no but it's um\n[noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I went one possible I Try to go to the the location where it was filmed and try and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case them known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing or the thing that the cross this this real and camera [noise]\nUm and it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're probably [laughter] that would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the courthouse cameras so the likelihood of this being a hoax was was that dropped off considerably at that point\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are you all this weird thing move a\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked with the deputies interviewed people and\nI had some ideas about what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is or is there are some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I Try and lift those\nAnd I tried to rank them terms of what's most likely which which things can I scientifically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe the photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell they came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well\nAgain it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nYou know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and try to replicate it you know take take take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI sell ... and I get that I get that and you know I get that that thing whatever that might be in there like you said and it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of\nOh I was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's\nOh I was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody\nA and actually I I was sent me an example this a couple of months back and said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image\nOr just behind her left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were nearby and no one's looking at this you know strange image to their left and so\nThat suggests that that they probably didn't see at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you and you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see with the eye and some things are picked up from a certain angle and but not another angle I'm just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that it just is the way the shadow is and just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up\nThe ... yes look like they're now lay it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame place was hunting for sure so you talk about a Bill Clinton the man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work and and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking\nTo measure that that we can't measure right now the new science you know\nWell yeah I mean ... you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the Mr request a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know those cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up and the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing\nAnd and I talked to one of the guys who brought all his stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with we were finished shooting we're going back hotel is it I said why do you think why do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of goes\nUh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago so you know even the the evidence doesn't seem to be getting a better it's all these blurry organist nut and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost\nToday might be the day I drop out of school [noise]\nLike you

closest we can\nThink to to what we've seen even though it doesn't actually fate ... with us with a skeptical of the ... dream scenario really because\nWe wouldn't be where it would have loved to describe what we're seeing and they can just dream up some plausible explanation that fits into the books that most people want to believe and they accepted even if it's a million miles away from

so uh you describe it as how you know being in I'm\nNot correct the will using the terminology and the knowledge right at the time\nThey had at the time but I gotta say you know when I looked at some of the stuff that you have the videos I'm of the light I've never seen lights like that okay you know I I saw the lights ... and things that you've seen but you know I just like it's almost like an orange searchlight\nThat that's correct and this scene off the coast that actually seem very very close proximity lovely probably four miles out maybe we have to tell because I spoke to coast God's

was a monster assault on over there interviewing people taking photos and so that that that's part of it is I've been able to double up a lot in my travels in South America and Africa notes where uh\nYou know I I happen to be there anyway so I turned into investigation\nUh you know I I happened to be there any way and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nIt just is what it is you just can't help it in your mind you that's what you do you you would if you were at that me hanging out there with then you would just be dying\nLiterally I can relax a little bit the despite you know despite what my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know\nI'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking ice birds and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the that have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak signing up there but as I was up there I came across um a a place called lake crafts and\nUm and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal sculpture thing for this thing as you enter the town and the town of the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] I worked as a car I'm like I put on the break but I got a\nI I Can't pass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right [laughter] right I'm with you [laughter] that's great okay so\nI'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween dying and Google that them down\nYour article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're not of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com scaring you skeptical inquiry magazine\nAnd um and some others out there too but I saw this\nGreat article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of saline they tell us the origins of Halloween\nSee this or that I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders is will if we\nAre going to come up with this conversation I'll love it my grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like that\nOne of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists\nAll the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the cult which is not but if it was some basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history\nI'm so basically Halloween a ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick\nThese events and holidays there's not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime\nBut basically you can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary\nBut it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice um and it's a time when I'm you know the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness [laughter] being you know something faster but to them it was very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nAnd so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so in wasn't scary it was like yes this is a time to store grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this month\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world was especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the difference\nWorld and you'll be the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry boat or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the er the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why are the the began talking about how\nSpirits which uh which come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also um in leader incarnations of Halloween there was also at a time it's porous\nAnd so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so uh for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would that were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that\nThe that are for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future um and there would be a proxy and oftentimes the prophecy a was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year\nOr oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example was bobbing for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so those so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way may I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] I Do it at midnight ride on\nWillfully night that's right will swing and [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you\nKnow 'cause I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that ... that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a\nI I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool jak lantern that you get to make I think this fall whether I think an orange and black collars yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which\nIsn't the goblins and very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of that and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here\nBut what we have is Dan rapper with us\nHe ends and investigator and an end to all the things that were into a as coast the folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's will is we have and you don't know what you might hear [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBack because the coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean\nTalking with been Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nBut I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff I don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else\nLike sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me thinking you know they dress up like your regular normally Superman something like that they can do that anytime of the year\n... you know the the any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask can we make make something out of it you know\nYeah agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern employed at real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly children ... and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids\nIt wouldn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to go back to solve when and the the the ... a ... version of it which were very and the mystic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that [noise]\nUm but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that um that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day\nWhich was a to honor that the church a church members to gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which bills were wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this was interesting transition from an early purely pagan he um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things you know sold day\nAnd and again they were they're bringing a bells and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know 'cause we were talking about you know where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is the uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise] um but then later on during the late Eighteen ... some hundreds and\nEngland was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween for ... for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the soul of the word purgatory you know there were there were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the ... the wealthy members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which is type of bread and in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the the uh the public and\nUm but the\nCandle at the land from the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they were these members go out for house to house say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's\nA who's passed on um you know with the ... you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the souls which wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of some sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read when when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn to now move on [laughter] ... some pepper I'm so worried candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it was interesting because it because again the sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again there was the the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time of the the jitters had\nAnd uh the the during this time the the jitters had pretty strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would ah would pining away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time he knows\nBecause that's what they did um but\nYou know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house look into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era so if that was typically sort of a young man's you know ... a mixture of this young man's project and the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing\nAnd rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as has the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean there were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's it that's a little less a little a live outlandish for for a little too much work for these days so\nThat's when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know there were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally a capital okay and I like\nIt was it wasn't even that like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple did you I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go a long time ago he was great you remember the good house together because they were there were years where you get food science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where are you hearing the bringing in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full side bars you know marathon bar and you get a handful\nNow you're the only perimeter marathon learn that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're great harm those I I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's a horrible ...\nYou got a full on you got a phone line is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those anymore those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and we had to go kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nBut we would never say one house and all he had homemade popcorn balls they were delayed it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like ... or they're you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three search the the the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a\nPoison candy scares and the reason the ... yeah and the fact\nIs that that I mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "07"}
