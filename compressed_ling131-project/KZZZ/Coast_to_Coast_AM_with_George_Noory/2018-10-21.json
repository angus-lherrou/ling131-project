few hours connection with the theme assistant secretary in the navy and from their intended user Roosevelt man and that of the political connections in New York to run for governor and then once governor I'm ... was a it was a jump to the White House one\nAnd he asked them to pull him out of the time when a\nGame became really some things that I Want it to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he was all like it kinda didn't cooperate\nVery well with a with little or some of those were his ideas and now they don't have to jump right to a jumper it to the White House and\nYou know start at the he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realize that the that old isn't working you ... and ... you know with a socialist end of it\nAnd uh you know we're using ... even like watching the suffering so\nWell we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone you know you can find a wheelchair at war and it had\nIdea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind and how\nWithout against the complicity of the media that sort of agreed to not talk about it he never would have been president\nFor making the parallels even if they walk it's a very sympathetic maybe they're just like today well ah [laughter] it's like today without weather like up in prison\nShort [laughter] a little bit differently he gets a free pass off the\nWell the thing is to guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's a history basically it's repeating repeating itself\nWith the Russians and the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible are offering it out and won't won't catch it with you know\nThey felt they are but how is it sets a that no one\nSort of you know noticed store or said hey wait a minute our president is in a in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then obviously we know better now\nBut the idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago uh that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and I hope people for time of the day that this was a guy who said\nHe would get really think I'm horrified thought processes at one time that you really really really tough so what do you do is we do it without someone ... you will come and help but look at your pain or something at the time he would appear to be walking\nA couple of steps so they could I just you know by podium use a little bit different than the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well so it or to ward off the fact\nThat a case anything do you\nEat painting insurance jumping to go public and claimed that you know I was experienced it so it was shortly and for X amount of hours so I mean look propaganda and all those oils and watch anything back down you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control it we didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could get twice a day at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which is seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um ... like this is complicated I I'm only to strike the\nFourth Amendment had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January so we didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a waiter take office for or actually so this\nMystery thing all the hundred days and they still judge presidents by ... a hundred days [noise] um actually I had one hundred it was because it changes\nRight he had a

without these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists I you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAnd Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and are you certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like\nFifty percent unemployment and the banks system had failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring economy going and\nOf course and remember remember the roaring twenties well there you go you know I'm you\nKnow things were starting to where it started out starting to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover\nGot in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on and here that fast\nAnd ah and also here comes FDR in ... there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation I'm In a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the grammar paycheck and um this was\nThe experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on your study or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FBI regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to security that act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have this cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had\nFooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing we're we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and oh isn't that wonderful\nPeaks and valleys in capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism cynical about him is I'm Sorry about that no worries if\nIt falls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUh um actions that were enacted a\nIn in who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act tendency valley authority hack securities act aggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act natural industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran it through I wasn't going to board everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I well\nI'm happy to board them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list\nBut it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that and he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\nIt's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it sort of [laughter] it certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin styling just Persia\nSo he was carrying just like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got nowhere style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenge and politically\nAnd that kind of salad did it FDR did it by ... Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nUh and they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal\nAnd they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount\nAnd I know in the history books history books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were uh they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were ... you know we're we're we're still going to get the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a kid I ... it was a top because atrophy\nHow do you use the training with the enemy act to gain more power lend lease there's the planes you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the lend lease program he was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to the the access powers\nAnd he was giving him to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this is Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal is not working so there was\nNo there was a lot going on economically in in our country and there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do our countries haven't I'm more you have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the two rockets to carry the nuclear weapons or for worse than the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now I\nMean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many hats that that NPR New Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen Beatty let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think after the hours probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because you just love and war\nFor more than a decade major league baseball players in action teams of high school students have been working together to train and inspire the next generation volunteered\nThis one of the world is just that simple act as transforming someone else's life\n... ... you want to join actually dean captains to make a difference in their communities it'll make you feel so good about yourself do anything to convince you just the players were more information go to action team dot org [noise]\nOh well that's wrong how now tell me they're not few shot their ship on I specifically said no she upon and and what\nGives me\nI'm not going to know where the guys checking me out are just looking for the number of again and again I\nThere's a better way to recycle your outdated debts phonebook call one eight seven seven to get ... death to nose dot com to find out how\nShot and killed two suspects identified I man Carrick Fox News it happened in ...

war world a instill at this point you know I I think she's Roosevelt still it's pretty robust\nOr you know he you know my my standards in Nineteen forty he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy\nUm he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I Want to back up all the minute and talk about the assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were [laughter] what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because deathbed confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents were declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy so you can really go back and pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with an athlete's by right or was the largest by Iranian and American history thirty three members\nOr was the largest by Iranian and American history thirty three members and that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazis firing eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nUm they attacked Chilean targets and has a state and they were all caught and they leave\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt\nRoosevelt some\nWhite House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years Seventy five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communist completely infiltrated a um FDR's White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House\nSo give me an example of give me an example in in Rosen those White House some some of the the ... and they had a ... year\nOh well the first communist overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there\nThere were there were hundreds of at least Fifteen high ranking officials in the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins was turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about Harry Hopkins is a lengthy later so they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter] um the or the White House\nAt the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office\nThe department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you one with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people\nSo I mean he was just communists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new\nDeal was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery FBI couldn't travel very well\nBecause of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth and uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt\n'em through the\nCPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way and like I mentioned that or not\nAnd how the Hopkins in down and get on famously he was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help\nThe Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute or he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards\nWas fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name I'm old they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants inspires all around the FDR\nSo so the point where they he goes to the Toronto conference you know I mean that's the uh styling knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences there was just it was incredible\nBut Roosevelt meeting at\nThese conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were er at the hands of a Nazi is weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin white information the right he had plans in the post war world of taking America was have communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so it was a little diluted in his own in his own right\nBut how this all happened was\nPrior to the ... of course this is a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to\nUm to the directors of Hollywood a union leaders are\nCollege professors he knew the target and they were were ... invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city in the city's names escaping me on it is are listed in my vote in the they were to observe how Russia\nDid things and how everyone was care for how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country has your you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town\nWas not a stupid guy right I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how are they tried to recruit anyway you add loudly\nSo it was a fictitious found that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go\nUm he sends all of these people home with of literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country and to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by style and spelling has the puppet master he uh he was this guy what he managed\nTo accomplish in his wife was incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution\nAnd he ended up they used to make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he was to keep the party's journals are used to call them comrade or with their own Conrad index card it was Tacoma Ghraib we're used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless when the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Len wrote that in his a quote from lenders will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMerge I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson again taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who

want to make sure you're ah you're doing OK and we appreciate you\nTo talk so you just want to make sure you're are you doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so\nI'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much of the\nPost war world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition he greatly diminished mental capacity at the\nConference in your pain forty four when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage these upon\nRoosevelt sprout condition or and and um\nFDR really didn't know what happened do you just went so I had to buy me you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference\nAnd obviously he's ... he looks like death warmed over seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as I said all I mean ... rates going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with him um FDR's being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of poison\nAnd let's see where are you thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us\nAnd you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about\nPoisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away\nToo Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I [laughter] I did a little digging\nInto this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nThat in the tiny march at Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people actually we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nAnd said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back to them they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors\nI guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard ruin\nThey were they had no idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American\nPublic just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing in\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors emmer Ross mcentire was the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a certain surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was actually our physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard ruin was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology with as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first time something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would\nGo normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety\nFive or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nEvery ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him so we know when they when they got to this\nSo we know when they when they got to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again\nAnd we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day after frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines FDR in March in Nineteen forty four and um when\nHe comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online and you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this was a dead man walking and the what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that\nFDR has does not align with the advance of polio they advance the aligned with the advance of poisoning FDR\nAs being slowly poison styling Stalin guide them I can tell you that I'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China and the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world after you I didn't want to share of the world with I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac look at what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that then it wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho was that they died that was part of the negotiations team in the U.S [laughter] on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aid died conveniently also on the brain ignorant\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was pile Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe from the Toronto conference dies on\nThe ship all the cerebral hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary\nAlso named McIntyre into relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of history real hemorrhage the drug of the day is morphing rat poison in its\nPower was tasteless order lists and its circulating all over the place as a matter of fact style and got murdered or the rat poison\nWorked for him to come in from the internal ... governor\nThat came out later as well so there's a lot going on war friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay style wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as\nPolitical savvy or so he thought he knew that FDR was\nA a

there either really naive or really dumb\nRight what were the doctors in on it do you think because you know just minutes before FDR you know reach for his head and said I had this tremendous headache and then he collapsed\nUm I think it was his ballet and he would you would you would give is a lay out a picture of cream and some cruel or oatmeal or something and then it's been described as glass\nOf green liquid or any of that how they did it in that in that glass of green liquid and was it the doctor when they connected to salad\nI you know\nI'd love to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt hit was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with is\nUm and she commissioned a private investigator to uh do you get to the bottom of this stuff so I Do know that um\nThe private investigator hit a dead end all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from a locked filing with us though so one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor and uh it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote it's\nUm the um the book being um\nThe White House physician and that was a rod MRI's mcentire were they in on the murder I have absolutely no idea I I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorant maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards\nWell they packed up the uh um uh Robbins and shuts off and they\nThrew Lewis Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the place that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm you know why\nI don't know why would why fleet a scene right right\nYou know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and then there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now the law was\nThe same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the pathologist so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know a lot of this besides that couldn't talk you know ... and ... and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him being guilty being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo ... by the way and no one involving\nNo autopsy knowing balmy it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through\nSo I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that murder that they gloss over um Warren Harding\nWarren Harding was it was that was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind and you know the book has been published for a little while now and I still even after the book has been published\nYou know I'll find a new fact and he got ... should have put that in the book I mean as\nThe volume three perhaps uh let let me get the calls here ah and he's an Alabama on the wild card line any good morning locked because\n[noise] thank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about ... music ... well several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party\nWell several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party says she said to my aunt who work at the state department and those remind now\nI'd also like to ... that's an experience with the blood thinner prescribe for my grandmother which was one of her in a college true hence things all over the party Bruce ... because it causes bleeding all in the body this month and her\n... in a room from\nThere you go but you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it\nAnd she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person's they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I'm a doctor but my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of\n... or so like my father was as well sure not necessarily cause breathing with any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York my ad Hi there good morning ah okay\nAs quick a sleep oughta and I'll listen over they at\nFirst I thought I heard um a gentleman on the air I heard wet said talk ... who also believes that FDR with with limited and I'd like to know if he is familiar with him and his theory around it\nA second ... and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about the new the new deal as as a\nUh doing the right thing around that that that awful so called Great Depression anti like thoughts on that and last late ... about\nBoth of the Russian connection and it's a both FDR and it's a towering stable genius if you will and the White House\nIs saying somewhat different because ah with the current administration is seen to have more to do with leading up to even out he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter righteous in Saudi Arabia\nSo I'd like to elaborate on ... and and of course the ah the go see a fifty fifty set you know we know that he has a ... and ...\nWell my I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think it would be kind of facetious\nOr above the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to FDR where we could do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster a little bit and I've had dinner with him and and you waxes on\nAbout the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause it to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of even a little facetious as to how how everyone is in history you kind of repeats itself but kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how\nWe have the [laughter] we were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country and it's really it's really something ... and he would he would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think the point you're making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from uh CNN is nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting\nHow how old the two\nOf the history of another red scare starting to repeat itself all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years past as funny which is ... the so becomes relevant actually interesting book I think you'll like it thanks for less than I ever growing up\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we\nCan here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking a break on coast to coast am [noise]\nHaving me real quick thing one um\nWelcome back and allow the beanie they are lined up and ready to speak with you so let's try and move quickly let's go to the wild card line yet again John his Long Beach California John good morning\nThanks for having me real quick to think wind um if you look at a at Roosevelt uh Nineteen forty four you look so bad I I have a hard time think that it had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may ... to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think you know the lip\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this or I was fascinated with tall and how I got away with all that stuff when Roosevelt died ... somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently to make sure that uh let's see if he would he would call these cars or a colon did a lot of that\nAnd I think he would have heard the story was that he would proprietor ... he won that Roosevelt the Web could break them over the call that the that to Iran and uh you know and all that and gotten the deal he was afraid of broad term I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I I think he did not want to want to deliver quality pop like that's just my my take on it\nAll right interesting John ... such a bad shape you're going to die anyway All right All right Steven you want to reply\n[noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have been slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting that what you said has been he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nThat's why he looked so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it spills without very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who researched this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professional every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as a balanced on one one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the ... in the in the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting you didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you that's an interesting point there ah let's see how to change in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning welcome to coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr ... he's just show banning it in your research physical or did you come across all anything about this just a ... an attempted coup against so Roosevelt and the thirties and dad\nOr if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a so happening and that the coolest ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler and that one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to happening\nUm if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSomething that you discussed in the book like a deep\nUh James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there\nI thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are round Roosevelt who didn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capital is to holding office as long as he did it would not would not surprise me but I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great and I was into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so\nThanks for calling I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\n[laughter] I mean James thank you for that way and he's in Chicago Wayne good morning local because\nYou were a one time you cannot do

FDR me try to make his own life or did they can only\nYou know that's a new one on me uh I haven't heard that but again like I said I'm I'm\nYou know I I Know what I Know I don't know what somebody else knows [laughter] I just I just I wrote this book and I ... I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the line who who operate it\nYou know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't maybe it's quality of life couldn't have been great you know with the with the situation of the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that Elvis Presley committed suicide to um I certainly I've certainly uncovered and who murdered oversight certainly uncovered information that would be gone to that but\nI guess anything's possible I mean if there is a situation where I can get on the air with the other fellow you know what I mean I Would respectfully love to do so\nI'd like I'll look into that a wing thank you for that can you hear Neal wild wild is in Pennsylvania we're moving fast You're welcome morning welcome to coast to coast\nPart Richard nice to talk to once again like why thank you\nWhy should I don't want to fuel no Mr oh Benny ... motives yours character or anything but uh they have to remember that in Nineteen forty five when FDR passed away the life expectancy for men I Believe was oh like forty nine that sixty so\nAt sixty three FDR was already beating the odds so to speak now\nAn additional medical science she was pregnant and then we can go back bring the the L let's when Elvis died in Nineteen Seventy ... or the medical science compared to the ... which permitted\nNow as I recall Mr all day and a a I Believe I called the last time Mr oh Benny when John and he said that Elvis had no history of heart disease now\nUh with all due respect Richard his mother was born in Nineteen ... died in Nineteen fifty eight which would make her at the most forty two and she died and his father died relatively young I Believe what sticks in settling so they can we have to ask ourselves whether\nOr not it was in the genetic cards for outlets to level I'm Alive\nSteve can tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis his hand in hand and said that there was no luckily you know there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that I Would be to kill them I mean it may have developed later and it wasn't present at the time of death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because colonel Parker she was ... was she like those okay\nColonel Parker toll Gladys that you're obese and I can't film you with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see all of us his mother because there was a rumor out that all of us have shot his mother\nWhich was ridiculous so he said I Want you to take these diet pills I Want to get your skinny so they can put you in pictures with Elvis\nI'm the diet pills and the alcoholism\nCombined is what killed her okay that's what happened with that as far as all of us is concerned in his heart um there was no real evidence of a heart attack I'm In a I talked to Dan ... who was actually ... the autopsy and they took Elvis Presley is hard and they caught it they thinly sliced it\nEvery quarter ranch to look through everything and they held every quarter inch part up to the light and they looked at it under the electron microscope\nThere was no real evidence of a heart attack there was no ... there was no hemorrhaging there was no nothing Elvis frozen his heart was a little oversized whatsoever for all of his other organs he\nWas years away from heart disease and you can clearly be said that um there was there was no uh Elvis Presley did not die from any sort of a a cardiac event\nThe coroner who said that he died from a a probably ever ridden me off was telling more stories and mother goose here we have the autopsies not even finish these tests aren't even in yet he's telling the world that\nI looked out in my hands him was like\nWow and performing CPR and this guy and then actually\nToday might be the day I drop out of school [noise]\nLike you might be able to stop me\nWith the United way you can tutor me be my mentor or volunteer to just to read with me ... there are tons of ways people like you can help kids like me stay in school [noise]\nMake nice except [noise] not a statistic [noise]\nTake the pledge to volunteer now and United Way down to the United way and the ...\nSome of America's bravest warriors are returning home wounded\nHere's one of them my name is ... while I was on a combat patrols a rocket propelled grenade tomorrow ... shoulder discharged from the army and I've been working with doing your product since two thousand and some don't have to be severely wounded below you guys have ... being able to share your story kind of helps you wrap your mind around what did happen\nOver there and my name is Marie and yes I Do support Bush Marshall shorter but don't suffer in silence on to move to more your project dot org\nOne suspect in custody another on the run I'm an Carrick Fox News Eighteen year old to fiery Maynard is accused of fatally shooting officer ...

I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction it's more like Ninety Ninety years [noise]\nAlso last night\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time an alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and their fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wife that she would do show\nThat more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the say are conducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the great later however she read candidate and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the sale\nDespite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says a New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's debt for the next ten\n... on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nDuring all that time she said she received no communication from Harry finally after the last say outs on October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up saying ten years is long enough to wait for any Matt\nA door oil was a prominent spiritual and so how does that how did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife or were both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes this very was movement is not exactly out in the fighting in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that\nThey did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow now part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act\nOr on stage and I don't know if they'd been explained to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this secret coated method that that Harry invest could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off\nCan you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number ten can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... all I Would have to laugh too did you find the coin and they these were which\n... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly area I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but that how you doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there started and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody quickly that\nThey were to pass and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book\nIt's all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people are saying it's on page da da da da di ... crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten were and how it's used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear us and bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow the color coding method works to form these words that they use this code and the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message would in code the word the leaves and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on who Deanie deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contracted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Fort how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWell outputs and on and just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked because bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments\nChecking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... who we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and asking questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and\nInsists on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother\nTo show him that his mother's soul was spirit we're surviving gap and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of who d'nese reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and\nTaught us I got a jump in here forgive me Thomas I gotta jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry who'd\nHow wrongly he was pushing back against

A. R. D. I. hey dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my gas the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas his website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her\nA so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works with the spirit name Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with theory very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was rose about ...\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted did anyone know did Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the ... name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet because I'm trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that\nHe referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of of other ... and\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all Wendy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on that uh this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only hurt but three witnesses one of them as a representative of\nThe United press another one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start\nTo do now denounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but don't or\nThe one name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nThat is heard about it well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social\nGo to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it looked like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this stuff stirred and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sound and twenty nine well she re camping and changing your position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward ten thousand dollar prize\nTo allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nToo because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nPretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you said I mean\nThis is a service announcements from taking fishing to determine is unique fishing licence registration before heading out on the wall\nEvery two minutes and American sexually assaulted being someone who gets their time\nBe to someone who went and E R\nB the someone he takes a step this is Christina Ricci with rain\nAsking you to join the fight against sexual violence and volunteer in your community\nLogged on to rain dot org that's R.

to get to the letters that are passing them for ten but they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please be quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just to give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIs all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people are saying it's on page the other that did that and they wouldn't have been named to the voters drive me crazy and then I finally found someone who said the name\nA name that is driving me crazy and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out an eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten words and how it's used to form numbers but not how to form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd um it see I hear Eisen bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that the secret message with in code the word the leaves and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nAnd therefore it may have been possible for so much to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit and\nOne of the last thing he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly he told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way\nI can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses\nSeveral years later correct by an Arthur Fort how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWell outputs and on and just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine\nAnd I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in this on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue\nArthur Ford was well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid was I going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got a jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me on coast to coast them [noise]\nFind out if you're already a victim of titled fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free which somebody to visit home title luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my gas the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas his website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com comments Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a ... a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there the the the medium would reached out to her\nA so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually worked with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where Harry would work with best the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with theory very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname that Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted does anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the ... name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um [noise]\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet because I'm trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I\nJust don't find this credible so I won't go into it\nBut um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ...\nAnd and again he just he he didn't of of Ford's through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThen we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly looking be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only her but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one it's someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there\nAnother a reporter with a ... either\nWas another a reporter with a um a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New Yorker graph or Rafik rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but the one\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced VA right um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him and she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBats heard about at well the reporter wrote this up and\nSo bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud it anyway and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean\nShe was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until\nUm yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends\nThey don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this stuff stirred and she was tired of being ridiculed by your friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if\nAnyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward ten thousand dollar prize to how to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so it was really interesting\nToo because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\nWell that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you said I mean but\nBut did you know when you donate stuffed a good

you know that name felt it was an awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he ... he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch steady I mean he didn't have um ... I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the er remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV

necessarily you know the fan I'm not much social personal\nBut you know when somebody comes down with him in power for relatives but the point where all the ... and they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing ... bars over over the bed so they can use their arms and then dragging or ... to try and get themselves for a walk every day the ... when that happened to them you know all the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in on I'm going to actually work he studied to identify with people who are suffering and who are ... you're losing it was a check once or twice a humble pie actually changed your life\nRight I mean he displayed you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had punches and brands but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had ... spelled out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would\nHave cash in these races and he would use crutches and he was the matrix incredible but yet you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging and solve if it's the\nTo the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs that and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he was turning around and dragging himself back ... you know quote unquote walking trying to pick stops won't even if this is talk about ironclad will you know what that was was uh was really something else or you\nDo want to come back that\nThat part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters\nWith cheapest wage in children and other people with other selections and that's\nReally impacted his wife to identify with people in need and suffering\nSo it really changes what sure\nAnd then the the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we ended up breaking the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a set of a sudden the sketch out of his\nJourney to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nHis truck for the White House start as a liberal Wilson and colonel colonel house actually who Woodrow Wilson was like all colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's well he didn't know that at the time if he was a it was it was a hostile employing them\nAnd um they were ... it's all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about the only that but it was just a great fan yeah we\nIt was through at a friend's house and I'm\nI'm a geologist and actually that was that ... says from secretary in the navy and from there and send it to use the Roosevelt man and that of the political connections in New York to run for governor and then once governor I'm ... was a it was a jump to the White House lawn\nAnd he asked them to pull him out of the time when a\n... some of the things that I Want it to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he would call that I hate to hang a didn't cooperate\nVery well with with ah with some of those were his ideas and um you don't have to jump right to a contract with the White House and\nYou know started the he originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we ... the oldest working you ... and when you know with a socialist onto the\nAnd uh you know was amazingly ... even ... like watching the suffering so\nRight what we were getting to the the new deal in the depression and and and\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or that had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House and a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of ... of mind\nAnd how without I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels the co-op it's a very sympathetic maybe they'll just like today well uh [laughter] it's like today without weather like up version\nShort [laughter] stab theloop halo suffering as you get a free pass off as\nWell be a between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's all history H. O. U. S. repeating repeating itself with the Russians\nAnd the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible uh pocketing it down and won't won't catch it with you know they felt they are\nBut how is it that's a that no one sort of you know notice store or said hey wait a minute our president is in a in a wheelchair or he can barely walk his he equipped you know this is the thinking back then obviously we know better now but\nThe idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nUh that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and I hope people for power of the day that this was the guy said\nHe would get really think I'm horrified thought processes are ones that you really really really shocked Joe when he would do is he like without some one on one arm he will Luther on them and help but look at your pain or something it'd be ... it would appear to be walking\nTo a couple of steps so they could I just you know by podium users will be different than the shops and you know they they do remarkably well so it it or to ward off the fact\nThat a young age anything do you\nGet paid in a church jumping to go public and claimed that you know finally just experienced it so it was truly going for X amount of dollars so I mean look propaganda and all those oils Walsh anything back down you know it's just that\nThe media was smaller and easier to control it we didn't have other things you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they did it twice a day at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you've seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely um\n... like this is complicated I I'm always struck\nThe toy the lemon had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January so we didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a waiter take office for or actually so this mystery\nThing was a hundred page and they still judge presidents by ... it was a hundred days [noise] um actually I had one hundred it was because of the changes\nRight he had a forum that he had a four month a head start unless I Will not take a timeout will come back Steve and talk about the new deal and the depression and communism and and\nCardio mobile gets in your pocket so you can take an EKG anytime anywhere and right when you deal with them to do cardio mobile delivers a medical greedy cagey right to your smartphone interest thirty second you know your heart rate the normal for a troop there relation is detected ...\nFatty nine dollars is a cardio dot com [noise] got a A R D I hate dot com tick unlimited Katie's morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing\nCardio Mobil much peace of mind of your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars ... party a dot com K.

you live from coast to Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talked ten ten ... gas who murdered as ski are\nYou know when people without these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington a and Kennedy of course I'm ...\nFDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and he's certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like\nSix percent unemployment and the banks system and failed and it just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring economy going and of course and remain remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to where it started serving to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover\nGot in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raised a few taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR in ... there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the grammar paycheck and um\nThis was the experiment from the communist the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on your study uh and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put everyone to work on the government do so we could have this cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed\nNew ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks

people now they must\nHave gone sorry about the words of pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\n... ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislation of\nA um actions that were enacted a\nIn in who murdered FDR let me just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue act\nOf creation of the

aggregation of gold team in class homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act natural industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran but through I wasn't gonna work everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I was\nI'm happy to bore them with it here at all I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that then he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the ...\nThe union which is kind of an interesting parallel ... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it certainly was\nThe same basic control he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just Persian all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or good challenge and politically\nAnd that kind of salad did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great wars ... you know he's seen lots of Europe's war was going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so\nIf this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nI'm starting to put a you know implement and then the second new deal\nAnd they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount\nAnd I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books page and there's this wonderful magical genie of economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were uh they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services where were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat a ... it was a cutoff because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act to gain more power lend lease spring you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was he was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the one lease program he was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the ... the axis powers\nAnd he was given to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union so that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries having them when we have spies too are spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the Wii to rockets to carry the nuclear weapons all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo when the book you argue as many hats that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he did he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or when he just sort of glad that\nYou know I I say in my book that I think FDR is probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because you just love and war\nHe did everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese were their oil

[laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote so the uh the book being um the White House physician and that was a Ross and Ross McIntyre were they in on the murder I have absolutely no idea\nI I I couldn't say I'd have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little\nIgnorant maybe and and what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she would tops has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards\nWell they packed up the uh um uh Robbins and shuts off and they threw loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the plight that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm you know why I don't know why\nWould why fleet a scene right right\nYou know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the\nNow the law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the thighs though so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally they're both at the fed as though we're all kinds of fun\nThings happen you know this but says that could talk you know ... and and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death to him being guilty being buried they couldn't get this guy's body\nIn the ground fast enough no nor did by the way and no one involving\nNo autopsy Nolan balmy it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that the murder that they glossed over\nUm Warren Harding Warren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book is unpublished\nFor a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact ... should have put that in the book\nI mean is that the volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here ah and he's in Alabama and the wild card like any good morning welcome to cost\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about ... music ... well several of your ... garden party she cannot aunt who work at the state department and parents from nine now\nI'd also like to ... can experience with the blood dancer strapped for my grandmother at least\nYou didn't win the blood thinner prescribe for my grandmother which was war when it comes to to handle things all over the bridge because it causes bleeding all in the body Montana and it came time to name your isn't\nThere you go but you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it and she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person go get you know either their their brains will either ...\nOr something or cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course on no doctor but my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of listener so right in my late father was well sure because we're moving with any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nMy hide their good morning ah okay\nAs quick a three part and I'll listen over they at first I thought I heard um a gentleman on the air I heard ... top ...\nWho also believe that that's the voice was learned it and I'd like to know if he is familiar with him and his theory around it\nA second and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about that new the new deal as as a uh doing the right thing around that that they offer\nA show called the great depression and so I like his thoughts on that and last late ... about\nBoth of direction connection and they are both FDR and is a current stable genius you will and the White House\nIs saying somewhat different because ah with the current administration is seems to have more to do with leading up to even out he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter writes in Saudi Arabia I like him to elaborate\nOn ... and and of course the ad that do see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has a ... and then\nWell my if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if you have to put words in your mouth but I think it would be kind of positions\nAre about the Russian connection with Trump but\nLet's just stick to FDR where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with them and and he waxes on about the new deal uh obviously ... you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I don't mind I'll just never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helps a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of even a little facetious as to how how everyone is in history you kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter]\nWe were right back in the same thing we have another red scare and in the country it's it's really it's really something ... and he would he would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think the point you're making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from uh CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with from which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow old the to the history of another red scare it's starting to repeat itself all over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how hosts refuses though\nBecomes relevant actually um ... book I think you'll like it thanks for less than I ever growing up\nWe will ah we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we\nCan and here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking us into the break on coast to coast am [noise]\nHaving me real quick thing one uh if you look at the at the night before if you look so bad I have a hard time thing that we were going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry\nThat they had to kill him because he was gonna die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may Truman to buy for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think he lip second of all I don't I've read up on this or I was fascinated with tall and how it got away with all that stuff when Roosevelt died solemn that somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently\nAnd make sure that uh let's see if he would he would call these cars or a colon did a lot of that\nAnd I think he would prefer the story was that he will proprietor ... he won that Roosevelt Web cooking rake them over the cold that the that to Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of but truly I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I I think he did not want him to want to deliver market pop like that's just my my take on it\nI mean do you think John ... bad shape you going to die anyway All right All right Steven do you want to reply [noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em have shown slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting that what you said has been he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison\nThat's why he looked so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance on polio and it spills without very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who research this and I learned from every one of them I'm not going to sit here and professional every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as now in style in one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the coughing or sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that it didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you that's an interesting point there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning look at the coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for my question for Mr ... he's just show banning it in your research physical or did you come across all anything about this just a ... an attempted coup against so Roosevelt and the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a ... happening and that the ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... medley butler and that one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the ... how if it if it's truly how posted it come to happening\nOr if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSomething that you discuss in the book like a ...\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there\nI thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who didn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capital is to holding office as long as he did it wouldn't ... would not surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and I'm Sorry I couldn't be of much help there like I said I I I I Would be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\n[laughter] I mean James thank you for that Wayne is in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to cost\nYou ... you cannot do your job do you feel

I followed the line of facts that brought me to it and I found information along the line to cooperate it\nYou know if somebody else has come up with that I don't I don't maybe as quality of life couldn't have been great you know with the with the situation in the head with this polio I mean anything's possible people said that all of us ... committed suicide to\nUm I certainly certainly uncovered in who murdered Elvis I certainly uncovered information that the phone to that but\nI guess anything's possible I mean if there is a situation where I can get on the air with the other fellow you know what I mean I Would respectfully loves to do so\nI'd like to look into that a wing thank you for that can you hear Neal wild wild in Pennsylvania we're moving fast You're welcome morning welcome to coast to coast\nPart Richard nice to talk to your watch again like why thank you\nWhy should I don't want to join a mistrial ... motives yours character or anything but uh they have to remember that in Nineteen forty five one FDR passed away the life expectancy for men I Believe was only like forty nine that sixty so\nThat sixty three FDR was already beating the odds so to speak now\nAn additional medical science she was pregnant or ... or we can go back bring the Elvis when Elvis died in Nineteen Seventy sat in the ... or the medical science compared to the day was permitted\nNow as I recall Mr obey me up I Believe I called the last time Mr oh Benny when John and he said that Elvis had no history of heart disease now\nUh with all due respect Richard his mother was born and I can say ... died in Nineteen fifty eight which would make her at the most forty two and she died and his father died relatively young I Believe ... he said when so rich and we have to ask ourselves whether\nOr not it was in the genetic cards for outlets to level I'm Alive\nAnd well he's going to tell you that he's and then he talked to the person who held Elvis hand heart in your hands and said that there was no last these you know there was no evidence of a heart disease at least none that had would be sufficient to kill them I mean it may have developed later and it wasn't present at the time of his death\nRight Hi well thanks again for your call I'm Gladys died because colonel Parker she was ... was ... okay\nColonel partner toll Gladys that you're obese and I can't film you with Elvis and I wanted to take pictures with you with Elvis because people want to see all of us his mother because there was a rumor out that Elvis had shot his mother\nWhich was ridiculous so he said I Want you to take his diet pills I Want to get your skinny so they can put you in pictures with Elvis\nI'm the diet pills and the alcoholism\nCombined is what kills her okay that's what happened with that as far as all of us is concerned in his heart um there was no real evidence of a heart attack I'm In uh talked to Dan war like who was actually bought the autopsy and they took Elvis Presley is hard\nAnd they caught it they thinly sliced it\nEvery quarter inch to look through everything and they held every quarter inch part up to the light and they looked at it under the electron microscope there was no real evidence of a heart attack there was no ... there was no hemorrhaging there was no nothing\nElvis frozen his heart was a little oversized whatsoever for all of his other organs he\nYears away from heart disease and you can clearly be said that um there was there was no uh Elvis Presley did not die from any sort of a a cardiac event now the coroner who said that he died from a a cardiac arrhythmia\nWas killing more stories and mother goose here we have the autopsies not even finished the tests are mean and and yet he's telling the world that Elvis Presley died of a cardiac arrhythmia in order for him to determine that he would have had to listen to the beating heart cardiac arrhythmia can't be determined when Howard has stopped\nMessage from

number of\nShared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife tonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time and alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife bass were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact\nHoudini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and their fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princes theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do sell\nThan more than two years after his death his wife's best attended the say are\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and assigned and witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the great later however she retired it and said publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the playoffs\nDespite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nYes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fan just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nAnd they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them\nThat got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there were contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow now part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photos psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coded method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain that she could do the math and\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number ten can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket political line what is the last two digits on the coastline and they these were which\n... play answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty age\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to him verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can now of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend that they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying say now tell please speak quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there started and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody\nQuickly said hey this was all in a book\nIt's all already published in a book this is no big deal I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book either people were saying it's on paid the other that did that and they wouldn't have a name that is driving me crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents they would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just stopped\nThe relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten were and how it's used to form numbers but not out of form or\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and um it see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code and the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about that a secret message with in code word to leave and the actual\nSecret tenured message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book\nEveryone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because\nNow we get into the sale\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit one of the last thing he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message\nTo bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by on Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWell outputs are not in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked because bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments\nChecking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and\nWe're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and\nThen sit on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to ...\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware\nOf Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nDid was I going to jump in here forgive me Thomas I got to jump in we've got a break coming up we'll come back and continue to discuss the after death communication experiment with Harry Houdini and best Houdini here's Jean night taking us into the break with do me

dot com that K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas ribs that are my guests the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical dot com at Thomas tight Thomas Phillips\nInfinitely mystical dot com Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a ... a ... house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there that the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where hey would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her um well he was very poetic with very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten\nKey words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd that anyone noted did anyone knows it or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pet name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends um\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up\nSomeone said that uh there was a big romance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um\nYeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other writers\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look and be quick in and these all windy coated spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nShe declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's\nWhy her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it signed by not only her but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this wasn't success that had happened\nI think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there\nWas another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or radical rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it read ... I Can't pronounce the name but I don't\nWant name but I think the first name is R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited\nUm she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says uh I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and\nIf Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social\nThey go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so it was really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer well that sounds you know pretty\nPretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you said I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "21"}
