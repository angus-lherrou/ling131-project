by can be very human agents mentioned how all the real news all the good stories get reported first in the tabloids\nSort of hitting that that the agents and agencies are the ones who leak or plant crazy wild stories about the paranormal\nGive them to say the weekly world news it's kind of funny stuff but is it true or could there be agencies government entities that tried to influence public perception of these topics monitor these objects watch and spy on those who had experiences listen to the phones all around mess with their heads\nThe answer is yes and the red pernicious put together a new project that pulls together far flung examples and government documents to make the case that it's true it's called top secret alien abduction ... and that's what we're going to talk about in this hour we'll be right back [noise]\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia down skis or first book flying saucers a blended published in the early fifties that\nThat sold in huge figures of gigantic numbers of books were sold 'em and a a dump ski went on the ... it's a all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a call me and this type of governments on the communism was the way of the future\nAnd the FBI open that file honor dams skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by this combination tangle\nAnd I'm a number of the the contact chase I've sort of similar approaches for example it again in the ... uh you have the of the area society preoccupied George King that was closely watched\n'em by the British a police force because I'm George King various aside to be very much I'm On the nuclear weapons and so falls were opened on them so in other words yes\nSo falls were opened on them so in other words yes we have files opened on the contact cheese but predominantly because they have these political slams a in many of their claims but at the important thing is\nThe end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um with non human entities\nYou report in the book that's coming out first of November secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before a brief him as\nA ... ... ... ... this is an abduction days in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard the new explanation but it takes government surveillance older level that story\nWell you have this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional\nUm aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio villages powers claim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um I live in woman\nAnd I'm and fraud tens of purpose if he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of an Sonia ... is\nAll you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspect to the story a which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio ... sees a report that he put together\nFor um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named ... says\nUm he talks about how the craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on top like a dish that were spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making the Beijing noise\nAnd that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road to some debate to noise\nSays like the classics and you get with a helicopter now among came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he still he didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial or UFO research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nOn the door but he re did evolve a helicopter but they talk and said I'm ... working failed lights at night\nUm they release some sort of average ... ever saw\nA witch incapacitated him choking on board the helicopter and the they a woman was really that on the part was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was that's the agencies within governments\nThat may well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how very modest with the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo what extent the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\nThat they they the abduction if you like was played out and buy kind of just then sat back and wait to to say how much of the story was taken in and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books\nIt was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal target to think that it's something beyond just some alien residents there's military government involvement\nI mean they should where it gets confusing if the you know if they're on January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine\nAnd then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO and go as the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on paper doesn't\nShow you know it gets really confusing when the cookie rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both and just not telling us\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's a it's actually both because it's somebody abduct taste that I spoke with said that they are a number of occasions I'd actually paying ... by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my face situation it was more\nBut faced military personnel were actually approaching the abduct page quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them and some of them have basically they ... it was a safe the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should have done so in other words if I were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um ... of the I've got paid a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast average ...\n... tell me how um he had to pay to correspond ends in the Nineteen nineties a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nAnd Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures that I wrote to each other back and forth were open and sailed back down which type\nAnd I'm now they can play done you know a family without making it look like the ... I was taught open race failed it was almost as if whoever was doing they want to Greg and college and I know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of luck and intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the you up all the old who you know I'm not as credible is Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt that if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I I think many paper associate them with ...\nI'll tell you what were let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side of save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons I think he's Seventy one [noise]\nJoined the ... the bones of recruits show up to each of these books on bombs which ... ... ... [noise]\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and and combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and\nI'm clearly a real one um they just seem to be tied to both ...\nAnd um yeah in abduction phenomena and one of the things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these wherever flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that up right\nOutside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the governments\nBut it's not you know by the CIA or anybody like that fly Malley cup does I don't think\nI think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and and most people think of them I don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it my faith even\nSort of fall guy to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fame Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which on covered by a fading information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these radio and I think whether it's ...\nNominees rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters an unmarked helicopters\nTurning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes of alien abduct taste and and again kind of light with college or in Greg\nThis might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct pays 'em\nAnd be able to to respond at high speed if in in the event that they have that the people flying ... were actually able to capture the abduction going ahead you know in the sense of that very time\nSomebody is tuning in tonight for the first time I think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the wild that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government should wait on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't any one who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we'd dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations\nI'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... and I'm bored of the United states in in the last ... Seventy five\nAnd and just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and on and I think some violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and cause that you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences or to literally physically real or not it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out as to what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this you mentioned you bring up moms are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there's no coming out about those are new to you the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the jury because no amount of December and then there was a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case with your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know ... story is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you our rights but one of the things I've always found about ... la is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think that the big difference we'd lives oh is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was he's never expanded on it if he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago\nHe's hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions and people who claim that in some way or another they the the graze the idea in Gray's who do the abductions\nSomehow they have this day when sort of sinister and disturbing and trashed and the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he climbed that's um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read I asked for this portion of very fifty one he was working at allegedly\nI asked for this week's portion of very fifty one he was working at electrically and um\nHe said that they the Iranians or whatever they are viewed as containers and um he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the ... had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell\nOn one of the things I talk about in the book is I'm a number of abduct pays who were approached find dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still asked questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of fuel cell leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force they stopped project we book they are not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know did anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were on going studies were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous\nUm in light of the kind of wild that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's the owner intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a\nConfusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um\nYou know it really is sort of a a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know\nThe says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating and abduction events but\nThen at the same time also investigating legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um you know being a just black and white you know it it's

Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um [noise] they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nA fourth visual dimension that the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions on not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh in more and these are string theorists I don't know um if you are your members of the audience have heard of string theory\nBut sure Yemen\nUse me so yes there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these were basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions 'em and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets\nPhysicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics and the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together we have\nWe have we had a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm like governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies in San ... and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorist and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it's\nBetween sort of the ... version and the ... version you have things like spooky action at a distance which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematicians who who work on on these subjects\nI'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's\nThere's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I tried to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and says I\nMaybe we could use flat land as an illustration is both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah flatland a great little book I'm so flatland kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written an Eighteen eighty four\nThirty has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flatland as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine with Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects with just lengthened with say some of them were flask where some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object\nA sphere inserts itself goes down in in in inserts itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat land the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object he starts talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the square says this\nWho looks out on his his ... sees the appearance of this mysterious object to first talking to him and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another another world and the first is this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're ... a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere regards to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pull the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and look down on his flat world that can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them so the square becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world portion is pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately and flatland it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he\nWhere he pays for a number of years and years and and the story ends with this for flat square languishing in prison I'm hoping that by his readers ... from the readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nThe idea that the hype reached a flat land wouldn't allow or anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interesting comment on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox but ah but the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where he father that was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm so happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know make maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine but when you combine higher dimensions and the multi bars\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea are very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment uh we're talking with\nChristopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors re going through that go into the brick\nDefined were George Nouri speaking ... website scroll down to the bottom and George ...\n\nAnd wanting to find on him to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension and has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I'm hesitant incomes an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he raises map addict and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hang on to that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty onto him\nI think is his story a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know what these what if these mathematical variable in my equation you know the higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points up to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he developed a way of what he thought of as sort of re educating the fences in order to catch glimpses into the into the higher\nIn order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and then they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll\nAh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues\n... shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this ah this cue these cube SATs together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten which is one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure prints and he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these are ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document in trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a few mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto a do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book\nChapter seven\nChapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis Narnia\nThe ... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy ride ends and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually\nTo you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely isn't there and James van it and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have they they get into combat situation OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings have either an ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talk about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimension how that might help explain what happened to him\nUm well let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality\nYeah yeah it's a fascinating and um your dreams seem to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dreaming\nAround the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the Swiss psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book\nUh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams I'm In that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also with soldier and and goes into combat and the second Baugher war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nDoes that surprise him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predicted dreams are what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin in as he's camped out\nUh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was he would have dreams and then you wake up on the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island\nRecognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in his dreams\nHe noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas um that the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's he's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French\nThey don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nAnd then a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island Martin eat the French speaking island that Martin me\nUm and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dreams how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but is venture discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google M. J. W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as those countries had

suddenly have this incredible powers the vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um\nSo yeah people people and Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says the same category but you do a address say on this and that people's attempts to reach a\nHigher uh our or another world um [noise] you know what's\nGoing on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or do you not want to pass judgment on\nYeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because\nYou know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had it in and out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so you know I\nKnow deja vu\nOr how that deja vu for sure yeah yeah I'm so in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are having um you know and I tried to put them play their voices and\nAnd how they understand what's happening [noise] um but I don't I don't know about finances you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these or does this is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I I I wouldn't\nBe so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there's no way that anyone could have an experience like that um so I guess I Would just remain you know open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that went down to heaven and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book you know the bucket has all of these big questions um [noise]\nYou know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibilities are and and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after this world me personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities and like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different opinions and the reader kind of decide what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to think how old is a bunch of folks on the phone to talk to you will go east to the

D. priest leaves unethical Christopher here if you've ever read the priests leads a sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books\nAs out of the wonderful book at the great books\nYeah yeah oh good so you have read it will very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I've been having is a is with the I guess with businesses particularly you seem to still be attached it gets in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their freezer this this life I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue of of time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental\nDimension of our ah reality you know also the whole perception or not just the time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we ... we see everything is\nEverything is is a sort of wave\nAnd I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies aren't but but time becomes very essential 'cause it just the existence of matter that you do an art project or our perception of it anyway so I mean they're just any way they have any comments or thoughts about\nThank you Charles appreciate the call yeah that's that's a great question and then that's a that's a wonderful book\nUm J. B. briefly I talk about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads hints and who he talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about um and he comes up and do it all to his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has um he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time I'm feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams either dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and\nUh he got over Fifteen hundred letters from from the from the viewing audience the let many of the letters are still extent this still at the University of Bradford I've been married to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book actually will be back Christopher white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty

goes to a human like both [noise]\nTried the fraction exercises\nNo I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about I'm\nActually from classes I teach of after college I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nAn eye on crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or like the water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what\nIs that a number of people use in order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah but that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWell Marsha I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try to suggest that dollar [laughter] from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... a a dream journal [noise] and I looked on the dream that my mother's husband who was dead was gonna give me a car at

with him with a date and and everything and it came true like months later [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses on glimpses into the future and their dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard mind Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\n[noise] good good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I thought that it might be better if I introduce\nAnother concept to him as a what they call a super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and they go into these different worlds for different reasons weather's healing whether it's neat a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things out there doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is a is not like you're writing automatic because not only a matter of quieting he's really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it'll start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have this and\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young ... and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well if it's going in you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end\nThat consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into his own where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences of all meditating it's much more a\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like the way you do\nThanks geopolitical you know you read about the musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue 'em apart written about you know writing yesterday woke up with it in his head yeah or or or or their songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists will have the same kind of stories\nSome of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there ... there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with Chris white\nGeorge Rock uh I don't think I've ever called in\nWell George Rock uh I don't think I've ever called in the year so I I usually call in the George Norris southern Dr ... thank you for taking my call but\nBefore I ask that question I wanted to just\nReference ... Salem is found in Hebrew chapter seven which makes reference to the king of failing in the Old Testament genesis fourteen so I'm going to end up for reference for the listeners and Kate and since you that you didn't have a I I wanted to try and get your opinion on not\nNot feeling in my theory that you up as it goes the angels are usually\nThe same but in some cases to be different for reference I'm a Christian did hold to the Iran in the Eighteen prohibition against us on collecting the spirit world but now they contact us\nThen I have a theory that in most cases I'm ... and ... I Want to ask your opinion whether the up and you saw the video up there on on a they your post\nHers website I think that they need to use a magnet for make a that pops up a pencils and pens jump around\nBut I also think it's possible that there are genuine demons angels uh parents which\nMay laid actual I don't think it's likely later this weird but a kidney or maybe extraterrestrials eating from another dimension and somehow hold in most cases the dean on our math rating\nHas UFOs and Eighteen but in some cases there may be Eighteen so I'm a stay on the line in case you want to ask me a question or something because this is pretty deep\nWell that's a lot on their Gordon let's let's get their take on some of that\nYeah there there's a lot there um there is a lot there and there's a you know there's a whole all of the uh all of the science fiction literature and um\nAnd even alien abduction literature uses that language of other dimensions right that that these that these beans came from another dimension hum so there definitely is a lot of that in my book and there's a lot of that in American Pop culture\nAbout um other dimensional or other dimensional beings um you also raise the question of\nYou know what is the relationship of UFOs and extra traditional rational beings to ghosts and spirits or demons and that that's also a question that people raise 'em and I'm not sure I'd be able to shed any additional light on that I I Know that from just some of my reading and and not literature\nAnd I'm thinking of like ... I don't know if you know what we strive ... stuff I'm I'm young I'm communion or yes she has a new book I'm\nI'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what the relationship is between\nAlien abduction and extraterrestrials on the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley is come to come to believe that there's there's a connection um and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well if there's a\nThere's a connection somehow you know maybe departed spirits um our aliens or aliens or departed spirits\nAnd do we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program Chris I'm looking for connections and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kind of subject as well whether there's a connection you look at the idea of universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't it crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about\nA a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and\nYou know I um I Believe now that that's a that's a very mainstream I'm sort of conventional wisdom now among cosmologists in theoretical physicist at that there is a multi versus you know which is\nUm and that that's another fantastic scientific concept that there's not proof for there's really not proof of that idea but it it is it has become a kind of an appealing idea to scientists\n[noise] today might be the day I drop out of school [noise]\nLike you might be able to

I mean there's no big cat lived there well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd I get every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the okay now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo or menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the\nAre these large black cats roaming around the a K which simply defy explanation because they share a number of reports from the bottom ... went to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every now for that many reports to exist\nYou know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is if they offer flesh and blood regular animals which not every race search with a phenomenon thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beat and beans of nature of this could\nBe the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we're right back\nThe words are at high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... it\nIn that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of the name and spoke to the local police so I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut ... in ... in the you know you have this weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog on the fence and black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven surfaces an ... of all places in Sunnyvale\nSeventy seven and a window in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's a really creepy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by a lady named Terri and she had the same time to in Nineteen Seventy seven we've ... I can only call like a mommy and black\nAnd not many black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies\nBut the real men in black and much weight as I sort of very ... and don't and look entirely human by sort of almost look ... found pie alike and there are a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies ... secret agents you know of a sacred agency but Terry told me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they create demanding black time towards them sat down\nAnd proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money was ... I was sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes these old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy thigh and didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the things that this guy said it was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she had a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFolk after that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it's all lost it and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how we would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man stories in the movie version of more men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people at different times but it's a harbinger of doomed hum than it predates a bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you ... you know plays out in the men's I think the what was in ... and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at the ... story that it's sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked chopping light sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity\nUm the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injury cold it was like approach how money and black and also a lot of of the amyloid they unconscious and also reports of women and black\nTurning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on the highlights of it of course you know you have the specter of the month month flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven\nUm they the towns um as it's called the ... was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River um put presence on one side of the Ohio River an Ohio is on the other side obviously and um the bridge collapsed

deaths and you have that was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nEither caused the disaster but that's all that it was sort of a a warning gotten to tell you that in ... in its own strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters and invite look\nI'm that's still very much ... if I took it upon you know to this day but there's also an English equivalent of a known as they our mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings and a a humanoid form\nAnd a friend of mine John Diamond says looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race a chicken investigating they all my stories about things would happen\nThe chicken investigating the al ... stories about things would happen to him like car accidents and are ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized\nFrom his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over and every time he got into he said he quite literally ... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting these clothes maintain\nA resurgence of interest in marked man in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports of people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking the part of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened or\nWhether this credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer\nUm and we get tons of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there was sudden spots and outbreaks of big activity\nUm some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side things for years and then suddenly there's you know a two week period\nAnd we get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of um I really feel like he's sort of power out throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though I think that the saved as being very difference of course but uh but that that wave of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interested\nNow from my own perspective although I didn't really invest the guy the ... because um there are a lot of people um who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about aids\nAnd it ... to have a number of witnesses to them off in Chicago I suddenly afterwards had almost as they sort of preventing dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and I'm\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization\nAnd I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea papal respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these I continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um and I felt somehow that he was connected with sightings of this my last month talked preacher so I mean my sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing\nSituation you know to get old days\nNuclear nightmares as I call them you know from paper saying these strange creatures was was kind of you know be disturbing\nUm you know I think you're ... you're careful not to take too strong of a position in defense of some of these cases\nBut occasionally you will make a comment and let your readers know where you are on it you will respond to critics who try to just brush it off and I I Know you have

skies both point pleasant he'll shut a lot of cancers with men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mom and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology ... all courageous aching 'cause I'm not entirely sure they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot by Michigan a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal that night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the weirdest sight of these phenomena\nIn this book the book monsters are several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cat she chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen an awful lot of commonalities\nUm or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has changed into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery but the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seem to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs\nUm I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally shape\nShift the like in you know American we have all the London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dogs men type creatures have said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one uh where will they that was from a military base not ancient either it's more reason to remember that yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce helped them re and are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\nActually I'm an American guy but it's working a overseas are EFL can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of vices which had\nI'm an American presence there she was a high to the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot taught creature was it not for the five that just the the face was very different\nTo how you describe an ape and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big for about a with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean he's a background in the military and he said he just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people a record ... huge dogs I mean right on um held in the ... you make that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic ... and ... you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the new or maybe somebody's dog got out in the living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the donors have been really dramatic can you hear a couple of those start with the the dome and\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mind which kind of looks like a a dog like on um\nOver here you know we have the dog man which kind of looks like a a dog like animal parts you know clearly it's not\nWell in England or the okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now I'm Conan of accounting dog who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the basket veils he actually face his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of wanting to face many black dog stories that you can find in the okay\nI'm back typically I'm much luck much larger than regular dogs are faced fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if you were to say one of these um find some black dogs with either made that you would die\nOr a close family member or friend would die\nI'm I'm at and light the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards I'm vice it like that in moderation is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying the fans have black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nI'm full nations around the a K and I've got two cases for Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black ducks fan and like they okay see going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things are you know ... not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirits of of that dogs would resemble the dogs they look like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there well now you write\nIn fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd again every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the okay now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo womanizer whatever my tax plan a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the\nProblem is there are these large black cats roaming around the a K which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of his top Scott let me just hundreds every\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around

him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost like the money comes out they was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off these really I'm sort of intimidating creepy ... didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy was going to happen to her I think they they happened to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFolk after that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really for

have a strong feeling of it either way\nWhether it is wishful thinking the part of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened or whether there's credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... in Chicago last summer\nUm and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other creatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there were certain spots and outbreaks of big fuss activity\nUm some of

I'm George King various aside to very much I'm On the nuclear weapons I'm so falls were opened on them so in other words\nYou actually have files opened on the contact pays but predominantly because they have these political slams a in many of claims but if they pull the thing is\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to the FBI and the other agencies were opening serve islands files on papal who climbed close encounters um wave nonhuman entities\nAre you in a report in the book uh that's coming out first of November 'em up secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before it's about a brief famous case\nA Antonio ... ... ... ... this is an abduction days in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and ah I'd never heard that new explanation but it takes\nAnd uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance two older level so that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional\nUm aspect of the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio villas Bowers claim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd I'm and fraud and sense of purpose if he was taken on board against these will so he was abducted you know it was a Nineteen abduction case\nI'm within you follow gee you know he saw the perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia villa suppose\nAll you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspects of the story a which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio ... sees a report that he put together\nFor um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named a love of funds has\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down on he started to feel weird is if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular and um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise\nNow that's kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape they the spinning disk on top of the road to the beach and noise says like the classics and you get with a helicopter\nNow mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd the thought that he really did evolve a helicopter but they talk and said I'm ... working failed lights at night\nAnd they release some sort of Arab ... ever saw\nA witch incapacitated in Tokyo mumbled the helicopter and the the a woman was really bad and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was then sort of ceremony asleep dumb back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was that the agencies within governments\nThat may well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad I'm On the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo what extent the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was ... when he came down to so metal ... claim that um\nThat they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and white to to say how much of the story was taken in and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was apparent in books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to something beyond just some alien resin military or government involvement\nYeah maybe we should where it gets confusing if they're you know if they're on January and I didn't have doctrines and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO angle is the most taste to try and\nYou know I'm just saying how it works on people doesn't work so you know it gets really confusing when the could be real abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible their agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a bowling umbrella losing their bones but not investigating the abduction themselves nominate know or are they doing both in just a really\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because some of the duct tape that I spoke with said that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was ...\nA traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more the base military personnel were actually approached should be up to page quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't have some of them have but I basically they ... it was safe the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should have done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that would be done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of a survival and stuff they have to pay a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm ...\nI'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay the correspondents in the Nineteen nineties or with Dr ... who wrote a number of cookbooks on abductions and she was an abduct pay herself\nAnd Greg tell me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures I wrote to each other back and forth\nWere open and sailed back down which type and I'm now they can clearly be done you know age late without making it look like the ... I was taught open race failed\nIt was almost as if whoever was doing a swan Greg I call it ... know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm\nAnd I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know and which is a dangerous route to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite them with ...\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side of save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons eyes and making Seventy one\nJoined a ... page with thousands of members bits Greek for show updates and to the fans ... dot com slash ... him including ... book [noise]\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a rail won um it does seem to be tied to both ...\nAnd I'm In abduction phenomena and one of the things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that up right\nOutside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly madly cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program\nDesigned to do the work and and most piping government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nYou know it my way and even sort of farmed out to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by a five afraid of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomena and Israel and I think whether it's ... or abductions\nThe goal seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters\nTo go near the homes sometime precariously there the homes of alien abduct pays and again kind of light with college er and Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just have an eye on the abduct pays\n'em and be able to to respond at high speed if in the\nEvent that they have that the papal fly Matty\nCups as we're actually able to capture the abduction going ahead you know in the center that very time somebody who's ...\nYou know in the sense of that very time\nSomebody who's ... tuning in tonight for the first time that they were all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the violence that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government shed light on these things if someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't any one really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves and less of age to be shed and if we dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations\nI'm a wave of an counters that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... near the north and I'm bored of the United states and in the ... Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and on and I think the violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences literally physically real or not it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out and it's such a figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up Bob ... in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there is still coming out about lose our thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ because those guys come out in December and then there's a book\nThat's going to be published I think after the first year and a lot of interest in the case for your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee alien scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know was on stories always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you out rides but one of the things I've always found about there's a is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when the story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think the big difference we'd lives off is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as he was he's never expanded on it he tells the same stories a Thirty Years' ago\nHe's hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average hoax so that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions and paypal who claimed that in some way or another they the the graze the idea and grays who go to the abductions that somehow they have this\nDate for sort of sinister and disturbing interested in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with lives all when he climbed that's um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this this portion of very fifty one he was working at the legislature and um\nHe said that was the ... or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of obsessive eating trashed and in the human cell\nAnd one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still asked questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you've bought a veal salt leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of do child wave\nBut some of the questions kind of do child wave the story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to UFO topic in general and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force base so project we both are not studying it is no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were on going studies were more than one in the fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous\nUm in light of the kind of ... that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know does information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelation I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence the government itself trying to get it had to ride what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um\nYou know it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went up the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why why I'd be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of rarely blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is\nBut there but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive I'm surviving solve abductees\nYes

incredible powers the vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you are not um\nSo yeah people people and Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now by a near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experience\nI'm not to say on says the same category but you do a address say on this and that people's attempt to reach a\nHigher power or another world um [noise] you know what's\nGoing on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or do you not want to pass judgment on\nYeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because\nYou know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] yeah I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so you know I\nKnow deja vu\nA deja vu for sure yeah sure absolutely yeah um so in the book I tried to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are having um\nYou know and I tried to put them play their voices and and how they understand what's happening\nOn but I don't I don't know about San says you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these are these does this is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there's no way that anyone could have an experience like that um so I guess I Would just remains you know open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think what people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would happen and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another you know big question that I Try to raise in the book the book it has all of these big questions um\nYou know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibility there and and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after this world me personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities and like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there and who have different opinions and the reader kind of defined what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to make a couple of calls as a bunch of folks on the phone to talk to you will go east to

D. priest lease on national Christopher here if you've ever read the pre ... a sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books\nAs out of the wonderful book at the great books\nYeah yeah oh good so you have read it well very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I've been having is a is with the I guess was physicist particularly you seem to still be attached it gets in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their ... says this is why fight with both\nOf us toward a about\nTime about the issue of time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality and and also the whole perception or not just the time but uh I mean\nI when I look at things in a quantum level we ... we see that everything is\nEverything is is a sort of waves\nAnd I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies aren't but but time becomes very essential 'cause it just the existence of matter that you do an art project or our perception of it anyway so I mean they're just ... anyway you have any comments or thoughts about the\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come J. B. briefly I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads a hint and who he talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about um and he comes up and developed his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one and a young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has um he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time I'm feeling like he's out of body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dreams either dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience I've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and\nUh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience the let many of the letters are still extent this still at the University of Bradford I've been married to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book especially will be bad Christopher wait we'll take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty things as it into the break we'll get some more of your calls and questions minimum\nDuring the ... page with thousands of members ... those are good at least ... he's like [noise]\nTried the election exercises\nNo I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise] I don't actually have classes like each of after college I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces\nOh is that talk about meditations on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that words crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or selective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach higher consciousness or um [noise] yeah but that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWell Marsha I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try sanctions adjusted dollar [laughter] and I think the idea right eat the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing a dream journal [noise] and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was dead was going to give me his car and almost some money so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was gonna happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that a dream I wrote it down with him with a\nDate on it and everything and it came true like months later [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream we'd get up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalist and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and their dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\n[noise] good good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel a cool super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's healing whether it's neat a loved one or for other reasons um it's an extremely complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different means how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing and ... it's not like you're writing automatic automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all that does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have this and\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about there being free spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's like it's going in you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end\nThat consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um\nAnd yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions if you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you
