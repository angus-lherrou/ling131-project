time to have you with us\nI Know now I'm great how I feel really good\nThe world is pretty pretty insane right now I've noticed\nShe really seems to be out of control and isn't it um you know I\nI just kind of want to say I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um we just need to really mellow out\n[laughter] we really do there there's just so much negativity and so much\nPressure in culture right now that I I\nPressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of mass anxiety and uh maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh\nUh tools like a tarot cards or believe it or not [laughter]\nUm are very very helpful for remembering who we are and I'm letting go of all of the\nPolice and programming and constructions\nAnd opinions and a cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff\nAnd taking a deep breath\nAnd receiving um through images through pictures that come to us from a really a mysterious place nobody knows the origin of the child cards tell you the truth we know some things about it\nIs ultimately the tower is a mystery we know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something I'm universally relevant for everyone in the ...\n[noise] how far back you have we been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence or fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about and the tongue renaissance but no one knows who the first designer was actually\nIn I I really liked that I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from\nUh from above or from beyond or below [laughter] below or within\nAnd you know I'm a union psychologist so ah we've then is to place that I look\nLet's explain to people who probably know what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is\nUm it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not bought a to Europe by the gypsies as is often miss misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first tarot decks uh started to emerge ah in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe\nUh it is a deck of cards um and uh in in some ways is it's not clear which came first the playing cards or the terrible cards and actually\nIf you think of the standards set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are Connor of the ...\nThe ... has an additional twenty two cards\nThat is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that\nPeople commonly uh think of when they think of tarot cards you know they have they have the magician\nGold card fool and wheel of fortune\nAnd things like that\nAnd deaths your favorite card George yes it is [laughter] save her because I'm fascinated by it I Know\nI Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the jets card as is the devil card and the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most\nUh uncomfortable cards of the major economy but every card in the ... as a positive and negative aspect\nUm and the\nTarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know ... it can vary a cult oriented in the\nUh nineteenth and a early twentieth century England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot really was birds with the uh weight jak or the Arthur wait\n... the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of Jericho in that\nFor the first time the minor are caught I which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the hips are the miners were\nOf the tips or the miners were finally illustrated with rich dynamic pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the pardon the expression Trump Card\n[noise] um where we're going to talk about that on the right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and get an impression of any kind of just kind of a sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um just had geometric design\nSo if they're forced suits you know like my heart's clubs diamonds and what's the other one uh ... right those are equivalent to the tarot the terrace huge of a cops swords\nTentacles ... won ... and all of the those minor cards she's had geometric shapes on so if it was a seven of cops\nThere would be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by now there is a very rich dynamic a image that goes with the meaning of that card and\nUh there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different tarot decks today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention so that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my jak has pretty after\nThe nine you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect so you know the card is in the car has an image and the idea is that\nWith an archetype an archetype is virtually any exhaust herbal but it's only known through an image or archetypal image\nSo uh like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the uh what is it called the ah ah can thousand names of the uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to but the idea is slate George\nA lame [laughter] I Love it though\n[laughter] why the the idea is that ah every archetype like say the cherry edge or where are the hero here with us and with the housing faces with whatever the name of that book is\nCan be a bill a straight and many many ways you know one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so tell us also a richly interesting a\nVisual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype but it's the same\nArchetype Britain it's the same a principal I'm In ... when we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union since\nUm where would tire we're talking about a special group of archetypes and these are called what Yom Carl you own the great a Swiss psychologist and philosopher center\nCalled the archetypes of transformation\nUnless you were with a thousand seasons that's thank you thank you [noise] um [noise] but it's it's the\nArchetypes of transformation is what the major are kind of the towers that means these are the images are the archetypes that are all about spiritual transformation and are not in a religious sense\nI became a position to be a because of my grandfather [noise] so I can help others like him I Can't imagine

now all they had you know well it must be a cult thought that because I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nYou know George if I saw something like that I probably never gone another person's\nHouse [laughter] well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see the ... the person who died\nRight and that's why I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the left\nHis ... always near their cash gift during a funeral or are they at all is\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where there's tables set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than this bureau will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said the that lady with that had on over there I said\nUh where a man said see that lady with the hat on over there I said yep he said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so\nSo they're very interested in what goes on is very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors there yeah I ... at any rate I go to this this particular funeral and the man was standing at the foot of his\nCasket and he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter found you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I said okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just\nSort of look to your father gave him aside look and so he said well call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement\nTrying to break open my gun cabinet oh boy and I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was rather than try to do ... van or what was happening is\nOne of the collection of gun\nRole he wanted to just keep them from ...\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet\nAnd the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago and I said point them out to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he learned to do this\nAnd she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing oh sure enough that's wrong well bill was breaking open the gun\nCabinet I'm right on ... [noise]\nSo it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me were money's hidden or uh I can tell you how many gifts I found for wives that the husbands died right before\nTheir birthday or an anniversary and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box or you're going to find a really pretty necklace that he's out for you you\nYou give them closure I Do I Do think about it you know it would have been really nice to talk\nTo a couple of your loved ones before you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the ... how many of them are generally known but their debt\nEvery one of them\nHow do you not come out of your body and looked out in your spirit leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nShe'll do not in denial they are not\nAnd I know there's some psychic send me the and said that they don't know they're dead but I mean\nThe middle of that you don't how do you not know you I Would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but he definitely know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm getting I'm going to happen and how to be depressing even for some of the ... I guess\nWell it sets a lot of them are set because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on what their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss anything\nPlus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you'll get or herbs and pictures perfectly round circles that can be little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly\nThose there's fear that have crossed over in our back for a visit if there is a design in the middle of the

you concluded the ball\nWell I really believe\nWhat did you concluded a ball\n[laughter] well I really believe it's pretty easy and you hate to put\nThis out there but it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is I mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and governance garage to leave or cut his grass\nYou're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move you know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me\nI Will say a prayer for exactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't that they're\nNow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you try to throw under the bar ... you never know what\nGoes around comes around that is true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get this done with enough intent or if you actually go to some one for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody\nThey pretty much know what easily the three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problem dating and you always had a good time\nAnd all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second data which over right down the

can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone you find the same thing with health if a person has a

I think somebody put a crush on me and and I should already let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean your fun Persian you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I went oh huh and I said oh look a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes\n... and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut stop sending negative energy to hurry war off right because\nI Am so my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish ... how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women than men she's gonna curse that person\nAnd because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself you have to call ... ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every buddy susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up this force field to kind of block it and she'll\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nPerson that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that maybe has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were cursed\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact think about and ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's the game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going over leaves you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does its negative energy thrown on that per se\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the whole team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers in a slump bloodshed ...\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's especially ballplayers look the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums\nYou know you couldn't

us well let's close John very close\n... close to the final analysis nobody you know the FBI and you know the Senate We're not really interested in half an hour as a you know drinking habits as an undergraduate or to high school where\nI mean that's what the Democrats were trying to do this really what it comes down to you it's one of the biggest squads by any political party it ever a stunt drag this poor guy through the mud over absolutely nothing\nLike you learn when you were a kid\nExactly that's exactly right\nSo and at least I had grandma to go to and talk to and get a dog you know straightened around in my head\nMost of these kids don't have that something to fall back on now all they had you know well it must be a cult thought that because I saw it on a movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nYou know George if I saw something like that I probably never gone another person's\nHouse [laughter] well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could she ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\n... she's always near their cash gift during the funeral or are they\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff and but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where the IRS table set off to the side with all these photos and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than this bureau will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep\nHe said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so so\nThey're very interested in what goes on it very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors\nYeah I ... at any rate I go to this\nPapers there are ... at\nAny rate I go to this this particular funeral and the man was standing at the foot of his casket\nAnd he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can and I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter found you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I ... my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said\nDoes your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just sort of looked him you'd rather and gave him aside\nLook and so he said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son\nTo go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet oh boy and I looked\nAt him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he calls me crazy\nWas it was rather than trying to do so when are we just\nWanted the collection of gun\nHo you want to keep 'em from ...\nRight so I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago and I said point him out to me\nHe's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over\nAnd he learned to do this\nAnd she said I didn't tell her and I said please go home and go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing oh sure enough this wrong well bill was breaking open the gun cabinet\nRight on ... yeah [noise] so\nIt it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me where money hidden or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for wives that the husbands died right\nBefore their birthday or an anniversary and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box or you're going to find a really pretty necklace that he's out for\nYou you you give them closure I Do I Do think about it you know\nIt would have been really nice to talk to a couple of your loved ones before you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the siege how many of them are generally know that their debt\nEvery one of them\nHow do you not come out of your body and look down in your spirit leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial\nThey are not and I know there's some psychic send me the and said that they don't know they're dead but I mean\nYou know that you don't how do you not know you and I'm I Would agree with you yeah I'm not going into\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but he definitely know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this is all fun and games ha ha I'm getting I'm going to happen it's gotta be depressing even for some of the ... I Would guess\nWell it's sad it's a lot of them are set because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on what their family or watch their grandchildren grow up and it's like no no no no no once you go into the light you can come back and forth\nYou're not gonna miss anything plus the fact there's proof of that\nBecause if you take pictures and you get or herbs and pictures\nPerfectly round circles they can be a little they can be big they can be any color they can be sparkly those fears that have crossed over in our back for a visit if there is a design in the middle of the or enlarge it you can usually CSI profile or a face of who it is\nIf the or is like in the middle is the dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have looked a lot of negative energy ... what have you concluded Bob\nWell I really believe it's pretty easy and you hate to put this out there but it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think it is\nI mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day ... your ... what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line so every day when you see him come out of his house and go into the garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him\nOr cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you ... I Hope you break your knee or I don't like you why don't you move\nYou know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for exactly\nAnd that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't death you\nKnow can that person one realize this is happening to them and to fight it off\n[noise] they can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you credit for a while under the bus it you\nNever know what goes around comes true that's true right but I mean the the recipient of the curve ... for example oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nI didn't get this done with enough intent or if you actually go to someone for his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody\nThey pretty much know it easily to three feet of the negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years old and you never had any problem dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after the second day to the job right down the toilet so something's going on\nBut if you you know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he has the instructions and how to remove negative energy once that's taken off because and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it\nAnd once that is released and gone you find the same thing with health if a person has a curse from them and they've got a bad health problem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the peace and you'd have blood work done the doctor goes no everything is\nNormal there's nothing wrong with ... we can't find anything\nBut gosh if you have a curse than you are negative energy and you what\nIs wrong with you is not going to show up we're going to talk

take calls your calls next dollar as well Marianne let's get back into curses\nAnd want to talk about the dream stayed what can be conjured up that way but when someone puts a crush on an individual mhm does the individual what happens to them do they feel something did they see I think some would put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down there too but you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that's when you hear oh I'm the born loser I must have a cloud over my head [noise] uh if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck and\nPeople don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life\nAnd everything that's going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know ago she had some fish rotten luck for the last\nYear what the heck's wrong when they start thinking about it\nAnd like I said you know what nobody has to live like that you don't have to be a martyr do something about it have it removed it's not hard to do you can do it and as long as you know ... actually\nIf a person doesn't even believe they have a curse on him and I tell them that they do sit down in front of me I'll take this off of you they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and apparently she got a promotion over somebody who saw they were entitled to that job and she did a ... square or you know decent and everything is great girl\nAnd ... strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day said papa\n... I think somebody put a curse on me and and I should Ari let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean your fun Persian you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said ... couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes and sure enough it ended up being the person who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine\nBut or stop sending negative energy to hurry war off right because\nI Am so my question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish uh-huh how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who put the Kurds on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse\nIn other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy anybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every buddy susceptible to a ... what about someone who's got so much energy and positivity can they put up the force field to kind of block it and she'll ...\nNo unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that may be has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses\nThey just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first and\nTo be do something at a every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them\nAs a matter of fact think about it ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's a game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time they're ... gets up the whole stadium is going over leaves you jerk don't hit the ball getting out and then they clap as he does\nIts negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage chats\nExactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their plane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her mom plans in the slump let's say ...\nGood a slum or they just you know they don't feel good they're out of sorts they're tired all the time and the other thing too it's a specially ballplayers look at the dead fans that goes that hang out in stadiums you\nKnow you couldn't walk up and stand next to LeBron James at a basketball game you would

[laughter]\nOkay [laughter]\nThat that shows you know let me ask you a question and do the brakes still policy now okay [laughter] okay oh Jay bad idea\nBecause what you've just done although it is I mean you have a standard brake system like you did before abs not a great idea not terrible but um if you need a BS function of your vehicle\nOr it won't work so here's what we're going to recommend that you do with the berry because your your gentleman that told you that is absolutely correct right or because of the age of the vehicle\nIn the miles it doesn't necessarily have to be the wheel speed censor you also have wires that will\nCome up and run down to lower control arms and think about it a little bit over the last hundred and eighty thousand miles how many times the wheels turn left right up down one million seven ... five thousand so the wires themselves you may have a problem where you have a contact and not to contact\nSo before we condemn the censors you need to take it somewhere they can actually read the abs codes and if it says something like a C O one wants three are CEO one one for\nWe're at say an intermittent a circuit than I Would suspect to be more wiring then it would be the sensor so let's not condemn that I wouldn't want you to go out and spend four hundred dollars and then find out it was a wiring problem a harness problem that could have been repaired\nOn the other hand if if you replace the a bearing and speed censor assembly which is probably what Joe headed up doing then with the connector um you'll you'll probably fix it at the same time so you'll never know anything\nWell with the wires are on the control arm and not have to bury my pointed at those real scientists that right I Know where they know\nWell you could go you know something like this you're going to have to take it to an automotive repair shop because most most park stores and things like that do that do offer that free service do not have the ability to do that they're mainly looking at engine Dr ability problems or check engine light problems and not a problem like this oh anywhere you\nProblems or check engine light problems and not a problem like this show any where are you\nAnywhere it doesn't necessarily have to be the dealer could be a private ah independent shop and at least get that code red and in fact at that point ah you know if it's going to tell you if it says intermittent circuit what's she owned number that we know what's the wiring problem in that sense or problems\nAnd if they find that bill six that relatively inexpensively um but if they say it's going to need a bearing and uh uh with the sensor included and you could put that into your budget later but the main thing is you want to have it read\nRight now the breaks for for foreign debt a shopper was that down on your own\nNow but\nAt the shop okay because normally to if it was a bearing the Ninety nine percent of the time the reason why you're changing the bearing is because there's movement very seldom his ancestor fail internally so if there's no movement in the bearing that again will go back to the wiring\n\nLike in other words if you were to if you put the vehicle up in the air and you you took your wheel and you should get back and forth\nAnd if there's a lot of like not a lot but if there are some play in there we know that the bearing a yearly or any noise when you're driving the vehicle now okay yeah in a very would tell you that but it's the sets are part of the bearing\nWhich sometimes you could buy individually sometimes you buy some macho right but again just that's very important you start with the wiring yes\nAnd and I are laid it out with the you\nKnow and it's just a good idea well here let me answer is the way I Would answer it and that is that it's not a bad idea as long as you'd never use your abs feature on your vehicle so what that means is if you get into a panic stop\nAnd you try to stop very quickly and have to steer around something then you'll see golly I Wish this feature work because I just it's something that I otherwise would not have yet\nYou didn't get around it or if\nIt's ...

eight Chevy Silverado how many miles Larry\nA hundred and Seventy nine thousand four hundred\nOr a very good and what kind of gauge is you are you having here\nUm age on the gas tank edge letters it'll it'll go ... go after everything\nThe uh survey comes on the ah\nAnti break break light and the a break like that and\nIt doesn't stay in a good running manner uh don't feed them\nOkay the check engine light has ever anyone read to see what service codes are stored in the system\nYes it does it it doesn't say anything about\nThat okay so here's what's gonna happen you'll fix the check engine light when you repair the fuel gauge and refuel gauges because of the censoring the fuel tank okay that'll\nEliminate that that's why you can't read any code because it's not an emission control fault it's it's more of a uh the end on the fuel system\nThe abs light same thing again let's go back to the basics on that along with the brake light or\nEven if you would have a break fluid that's a little lower than normal in the reservoir there is a level censored there if the level is below the censor it will trigger the brake light and the abs light so did you do the basics to make sure that the masters cylinder is full of a break fluid\nOkay I had a problem with bricks animal replace okay and they let it come out\nRight that is why the abs and the brake light as soon as you take care of the hydraulic problem now\nAnother issue on your vintage truck and your your truck they were known for having abs pumping motors assembly would fail for example when the brake lines rotted out\nYou stepped down to break the pedal went to the floor and activated the ... and if the ATF system is not used in other words will say it went dormant for four or five years in the sense of where you didn't have an emergency stoppers light on ice\nThis pitched in inside the uh abs pumping motors assembly will become stuck so that's another problem so you you have air in the system and most likely you have a problem with the abs pump motors simply\nSo again would you need someone to do is read the service code on that and and if it says you know high hydraulic motor failure or anything in that order a than we know for a fact that that abs pompous simply has to be replaced\nAnd then again after a tree place there's a proper bleeding procedure ah that's going to take care of the rest of the breaking problem\nSo it's like a a victim in the ... of the uh the ... when the brake lines failed and rushed it\nAll right the very good preaching to the call you have a good day they're leery when
