I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked about would knocking that the people are hearing what's going on with that what's not Saddam\nWell you know\nThis is one of the things that we we see on the television or relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nUh they apparently believe that this is some type of communication uh between big foot you knock knock back with the signaling each other in the woods but this is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\n\nIt really disapproves of the woods knocked\nBecause according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a a semi pro landscape photographer [noise] uh and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty seven teams July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them were walking into this area to take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional\nBut he had been doing it for twenty five years and never considered himself to be a professional\nAt any rate there in the valley\nTaking pictures and there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock emanates through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up on the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around and sit through a husband I see something pacing around over there on the hill fried\nAnd he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside to\nTwo legs show he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it\nAnd he says even though it was so small in his lens at the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swimming in the arms up in the air I'm like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well ah so then they're watching this thing\nIt stand still raises its head up into the air like a Halloween wolf\nPuts his hands by its side just like you will I Would do [noise] ... voice forward and then they hear the knock you know what I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue against review your mouth [noise]\nYou've got at George is like only like you know a ...\nSo he said it wasn't a knock at all but it was more vocalization that the creature\nWas able to do somehow with the it's wrote it song its mouth who knows you can ask him questions but he said it was not a knock at all so then that was really you know interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nYou did you in your opinion is is it ...\nI don't know George I amplify aren't you yeah it's ... it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walked on Ford's very rarely will and he walked just standing up right it uses its arms and knock holds on a move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really yeah uh I mean people have encountered them uh hitting all fours\nWho would look like a beer to me did that\nYeah but a little different uh I'll give you this is this is really a stranger encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons sites\nThe strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon raw\nYou always wanted one I got a he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter] so the\n[laughter] ... they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd uh he was scared out of his way to put the he fought through it and they went for a ride and he asked the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of weight to them and said you let me know when you get really comfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this uh farmland and moral and\nWhat he is what\nHappens which is really unusual they got to a point in their flight they will all the people in the ... with them by the way it was like just him and his wife to probably five or six people and now they got to a point where the pilot or the balloon\nLowered the balloon over all wooded area so that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this\nThen he'd lifted it back up again as they made it across the next ... field he did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who carried on in this scandal\nBut here in with the big foot comes in when they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing\nThat kept quiet and you can't control the balloon this fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking it hit the deck on all fours and took off he said it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRaise you see that's unusual isn't well I\nI mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story and one of the books that cold along came a spider\nWhere these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of a federal log on to all\nThese guys were Hong Kong thing\nAnd they were sitting in a field uh coming up on dusk waiting for the Hong Kong to come down the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass and the grass was sporadically patch and all the words that were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass\nWorking your way around the field they saw what he described as a furry army how might sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome of black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass\nIn spurts similar to like a spy to want to move quickly and stops moved quickly and stopped finally they catch this thing causing an opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which was still far away\nWhen this thing came into the opening he said it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards the Hodge and as they were watching this thing it's going up and one that stood up they knew it was a big foot and\nThis thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive on to one of the harms some type of quick movement on the ground and left the field\nWith the hog under it's all in one of those are story William we're going to come back and take promise phone calls next on pills to\nOne of the ... or ... or do that you were just being in our twenties monthly line Jim or read the transcripts leader your jewelry chance with you can do the the month this visual you beat your leader and among\nYou're in the process

going to take the calls but William before we take calls where do we get the book Bigfoot terror in the woods\nUh the books are there's actually four volumes the fifth one just came out uh they're available on Amazon and pay them back and in Kindle format\nSo you know you can have your druthers whether you're a a Kindle user or if you like a a paperback book which I kind of ... myself I like the field of pages and touched\nThe old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup\nLet's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started the Robert go ahead sir\nThank you George structure you hear me okay on you know we can\nThank you two questions first of all if you ever seen a photo of a tool or they were captured and killed him and so rainy and around a little too shattering the my goodness this thing really looks like the real McCoy\nThis was in Pennsylvania now and I should go Eighteen Seventy they're all in this one big foot up and the other big foot they have them and\nAnd the second question I have as you mentioned that your little some men that shot a big select what happened after the break ... why would he go down like I mean they should or what kind of weaponry well\nHere's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania a what I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an ... interesting\nUh that came from a photograph taken from a a grandparents' house after the ...\nFinal grandparent had died in which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a\nAfter Roosevelt pet established the uh the\nOf the parks are they they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and ranger stations\nSo they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted demand off of is caught and the other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes\nAnd grabbing guns shooting at a thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment\nNow but the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seems that shock gunfire\nHas almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big what's being shot\nOr in my account called the fifth bullet this guy was hunting and um I think was Idaho at any rate he came to an area where in the woods where he was confronted with\nBut any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountain and sit in a ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a quanta taught me that sticks\nHe said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lends itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch bows or bows and branches formed and this type of thing and the inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting\nSo his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown to change on this region line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing\nA dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill now he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the fight on it and pumped around over its head thinking he was scary it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that\nThe cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was a posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms\nPumping and like nothing could stop them even load is gone fired a second round out that he was sure we hit it it had no effect on them and they kept running he fired a third and fourth round\nAnd if things kept coming at him now was closing in squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why it named a story the bullet and they finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this shooting this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger or this things coming at him like a bad idea how he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he saw it lying on the ground he can see that it had been wanting to do was multiple blood\nPatches where these bullets had actually hit it but why these things can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't have a moon shot or in Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or heart shot some type of solid organs shot these things can run\nAnd hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures it seems like to me\nIf you are going to take one of these things down it's gotta be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... something punter sadly they have to take them now well I mean what are you going to do George\nRhino R. by the way I've looked at the picture than Eighteen seventies series big foot\nOr they didn't have photo shop the news you know very very intriguing picture\nThey got a couple of these are all hunters with the big for a they're holding him up a huge zombies the dead one huge huge huge huge I mean you just Google\nEighteen Seventy big shot in Pennsylvania in the pictures popped\nAmazing ...\nAnd I I have a diary accounts a cold that the hunters diary it's it's no longer than a handwritten letter that you would write\nThe to your wife and in there\nThey're not talking

reached in three hundred and news articles written\nSo a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would the ... and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save\nPolar bears ...\nIf we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are and I have never been a fan of that because you know I I I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that we need to fix that\nThere's a real pollution we need to fix that is\nCorrect but I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere and anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist a thousand years ago and we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd uh you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting with a quote real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide\nThe mercury particulates with\nCarbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and then he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming and humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations in the European\nCommunity sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion the the first thing is that uh the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so\nThe computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is being driven forward by momentum by money\nMhm uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industry is we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations and there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second there's there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about fears\nAnd the lately the last couple of days they've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just to post an article on CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change\nAnd he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nThat yet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work [noise]\nUm the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun\nIt's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change he bloody hands\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what was Hurricane Florence\nAnd last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida but if you look back at history this has happened before we've had\nA twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green blocks Steve ... linked up the coast to coast team dot com spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. each am dot com ... ...\n... new version of ... a a map is now available Rawhide bone in now enjoyed ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today\nSure well that's this is a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and um one popular business Frazier's over and over and think outside\nThe box so the title was\nThick outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green bucks a sustainable development there they're forced to do many things that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through\nOf that don't really do anything for the environment and so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction\nUh and the fourth is a resource depletion those for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy [noise]\nUm and they're taught in universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a colored paper back in a\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper one of the way for size it's a heavy blonde [laughter]\nWell I don't know about that but there's lots of reasons why we put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\n... which climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nIs going to be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning on a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I so I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but the others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\nOn who you know one of my simple series on why the ... theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet is way way down there oh yeah and in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise] but they didn't\nFirst we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output\nBut the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate the number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families so all none of this was foresee\nSo they're having smaller families so all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd a benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross in Philly too fine and it was driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere he said was this and you know for New York and Los Angeles yeah I've been looking at how homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so it really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call wasted dumped everywhere pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is a it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand there they're going to want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo he just had about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\nBut ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United States Senate is now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide articulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide\nIs what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow a bigger and faster its its plant food\nThat's right or the idea that ah that C. O. two as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three has nothing those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you gotta clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aims that the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you've talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... ... ...\nYeah well we've had a a basically a rate payer

people are conflicting what are called real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur\nDioxide the mercury particulates\nWith carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas and what I speak to groups I like to say to them what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents for man made climate change\n... it's a bit of a long story it back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and then he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming and humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European\nCommunity sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that the the world's kinda jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it to the temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a\nMuch of this as being driven forward by momentum by money [noise]\nUh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industry is we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations and there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from a warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nBut you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just a posting article and CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer\nAnd that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had that one degree of warming\nForest fires well we've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree in that\nRespect and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that comes straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a son to say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work\nUm the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease that we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things they're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change he bloody hands\nBut I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\n[noise] well if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh um what was Hurricane Florence\nAnd last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states and these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century\nOther ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green blocks Steve Steve's website linked up the coast to coast am dot com I spell it for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. each am dot com ... ...\n... ... am map is now available for I'm bone in now enjoyed ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nAll [noise] sure well that's this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business Frazier's over and over and think outside the box so the title was think outside the green bucks\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green bucks a sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOr the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion those for fears are really at the basis of all of a or state\nOr fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy [noise]\nUm I and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's fun to read it say a color paperback and a\nLot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper by the way for size it's a heavy book\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of reasons you know put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kinda summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nWould weeds climate change you with what's happening I'm I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you on\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nIs going to be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and ah yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is gone in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I so I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase phrase fossil fuels I like to use the commercial hydrocarbons instead\nOn who you know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet he's way way down there oh yeah and in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah some of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is a lot of it has been\nYou know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the bottles of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up and until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy ... the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nBut they didn't uh first we had a global\nAgricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping\nThe fertility rate right the number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological\nA sort of a state we have more women entering the worst workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families so all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get to global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years\nAnd so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nBenefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross and silly fine and as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis I saw\nBecause I spend a lot of time in St Louis I saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nVice versa had was this and you know for New Years in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking out the homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so it really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dumps everywhere pollution\n[noise] uh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that\nIf I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo you just add about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right more would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation\nWell ... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going into land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states and then as now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow a bigger and faster its its plant food\nThat's right or the idea that ah that C. O. two as harmful as crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to his carbon dioxide three has nothing those are all invisible\nSo if you can if you can see the air you got to clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aims that the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nYou talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... ...\nYeah well we've had a ... a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um\nWe had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a minister\nOf Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leaving the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier Doug Ford took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar a contracts they eliminated um uh for the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credit\n[noise] but I looked out in my hands and was like\nWow I'm performing CPR and this guy and then actually met him um that's probably one of the coolest guy to my life being able to talk to\nA guy after I came to our\nRead was just Seventeen when he heard a cry for help thanks to his Red Cross training he didn't freeze you didn't panic he knew exactly what to do Red Cross training saves lives sign up for a class today and Red Cross dot org\nTo crowd out I'm registered dietitian each incidents critiquing brain economy in the ... kids don't like ... pizza or peanut butter sandwich steady show brackets eaters are tardy less often have higher test scores and better myself coordination in Iraq tightened meal temperature waffles are small bagel\nNot hungry as a hundred percent juices fine\nFor later skipping meals can cause overeating so wait refill and then the kids eat right or\n\nFBI almost done with the investigation on Dave Anthony Fox News Fox has learned the report could be turned over today after probing the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\n\nWe want cabinet ... last night at a Trump rally in Mississippi where the president said the Supreme Court nominees being looked at it as guilty until proven innocent\nThat's very dangerous Veronica\n[noise] well I don't know what I Want\nA lawyer for Dr Ford called the president's remarks that vicious violent so let's attack calling for a profile in courage and the president that profile in cowardice day\nRitual that don't want to poison the president's a letter intercepted before reaching the White House had suspicious material and is being investigated the FBI's also analyzing two letters to the Pentagon want address the defense Secretary Mattis they were also intercepted and initially tested positive for the poison rights and\nThe White House is calling false and an accurate in New York Times story\nThat claims President Trump years ago got hundreds of millions of dollars from his father with\nMuch of that money to tide says coming through questionable tax schemes in the Nineteen nineties according to confidential tax returns and financial records obtained by the times the president and his family set up a ... corporation in an effort to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents as Fox's\nJohn decker ... corrupt and got an Indonesian islands sending ash miles into the air the same island devastated by the earthquake and tsunami\nBrought in more than fourteen hundred people are dead Fox News fair and balanced\nNation coming to you know they can be the personal\nThings you know Fox News rundown weekly morning projects dives deep into the major and controversial during the day to buy the anchors of Fox News radio driving out of your perspective of news you won't find anywhere a plane now on Fox News but I guess you know job\nAnd there was watching the news they want someone like the ... job is to cut through the talking points Martha ... we're going to have the top question because there's a lot of conventional wisdom out there\nThey need to be challenged when I'm making sure that whatever it down for the day people are fully informed the cows were twenty four seven news\nGoing to be here let's we're going to be fair weather for am a midnight\nIntroducing the YMCA sure you know the why for us when we're a game of who who were more than that we were cause\nYou take a jumps out at the Y.

D democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have a have a form of democratic government so it's gone from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law limitation of slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's going to collapse overpopulation we got pollution we've got all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\n... what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um\nA crisis here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now we're the biggest petroleum producer\nSo should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're\nEither not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during a quote on whether and they tend to postpone

back and final segment with Stephen Moore I'm Steve when you're out of synch what seems to be the question that most people want answered\nWell there are many um [noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses\nAnd one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the\nChoir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is\nThough they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate was in the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines are grip but a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority [noise]\nAh so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm [noise] let's see what are some of the other major questions\n\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nI'm concerned about anything\n[noise] [noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations in the inner governmental panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and the low of two tenths and if you put those on the chart\nThose rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong\nAnd natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York the Rockies Joe\nHey Steve interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but Alaskans\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just hired a and a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned\nThat that was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people could of data and all of\nThis thing so I I relate this to a ocean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that second question would be\nA political climate you know ... ... talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and a and a\n... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the and trust and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial but he's already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane on the Washington Post and then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was

only buried it's still active it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles from the place all these years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you got to the point right now and I'm a big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people will take them and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um the thing you said\nAbout ... uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve is they need to be able to shut down automatically we still have plants and most of the ones around the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was um\nSatellites well you said something about governments and what's your question yeah I'm\nJust saying I I think you know as Yemen areas are undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress\nI think the majority of a arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem on most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have a we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster\nPolitical leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've gone as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in a rigorous useless forever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those volcanoes go off in Antarctica note of big bunch of south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue there's many many things that could occur\nUm again

I just think it's common sense that the human population now cannot increase out in a lot of them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not then you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points wall but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nUh we are certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think we have sixty million bikes and at one time estimates are those

I think some people misunderstand that I did a little disclaimer inside the cover and it was kind of a play on words\nBut uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works over worker fiction\nAnd the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world every thing about big foot is fiction for the most part what do you go before\nSay the Patty film or to date after the Patty film or most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod I mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about a UFOs\nYour typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face\nListening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive ... book and he claimed that he shot too big for ... and have them and of course I don't know what happened to the guy\nThey had them and of course I don't know what happened to the guy and I definitely don't know what happened to the recorded ... what are those kinds of stories in your opinion authentic or made a\nWell you know [noise] what are we talking about George we're talking about one person it's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof\n[noise] yeah I Believe that these people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it and\nI'm thinking about it the man was not being paid he could have easily just shut up and walked away he didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything\nYou know [noise] uh\nHe was reporting what had happened and the fact was he like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise]\nAh haven't seen that they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions\nAnd so they buried him a I've had a couple of encounters a where animals had been killed was said to have been killed one of them are wasn't self defence\nAnd ah this man felt this thing was going to kill him a and\nWhat are you to say about that am I to say you know you're wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if he'd like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things you or it could\nShow we will do that in we've got a break coming up in a couple of minutes or ... or ...\nOr like I said I have some people are who have seen buddies a couple of guys say they have shot them and as far as bugs are concerned\nI thought he knew his firearms I thought he knew his uh bullets\nUh it didn't seem it seemed very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down south uh ended his neck of the woods\nThat do go out on these night Hans a I have a couple of uh accounts what guys were out hog hunting feral hogs\nAre which is becoming a big problem downhill\nIt's huge and through and are\nThere are people actually being hired out now by a former and landowners a because they're in fear of their children are getting attacked by these boards and whatnot\nThat a hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf cart so they could ride around rather a stole fully\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide but um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down\nA thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a call ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as he kind of realized what was going on he saw a big flood looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the two trials the guy is ... and the big foot\nLooks at him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big flood and the big foot took them look at them and gave one death now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy cold and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most one of the most unreal stories\n[laughter] or if I heard that I Would have discounted it are entirely however having said that I had a gentleman was canoeing in Vermont\nAnd uh he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story William we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I've always had suspects about that the fishing story but let's get yours when we come back\n... the new version of the ... a a map is now available for I'm bone in now enjoyed for ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good acoustic goes to\nThis ... on demand anywhere any time I

Seventy nine three seven P. A. T. three and a nine month three\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to the cultural here with William ... author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe and break up\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was pulled urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd uh he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping on the side of the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up for dinner so he had caught a few book trout late amount of rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit we're gone now\nHis first instinct was that a raccoon took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happen to me fishing connect quite river or wherever I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow I had laying up on the side of the river [noise] ah I see a raccoon stick\nIt\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought so a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at almost ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grabbed numerous fish and retracted back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that it was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that where it had reached out at ground level\nHis tent was set up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make his way out with the canoe but he had said that he thought it was a big foot obviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand standing out of the bushes\nAnd then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly\nIn other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nIn ... Ninety company and\nWas able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing show what he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself or in such a way where it could get up there to\nThe fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him when he saw the first group of fish\nMissing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe and he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he caught was not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people described the creature in terms of height no big how big\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a\nAnd I had a ... point he had\nYeah a lot of people say the comical shape Ted there's varieties of ah a hair for coloration ranging from like ... salt and pepper\nChew a lot of people use the term or burned or read a and then of course brown and black so there seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique [noise]\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost ... very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the tenth degree type of body\nYou know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the tenth degree type of body extremely muscular a V. chest you know Bolger thighs you know just like a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one I'm\nA one story called decreased and an incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who's twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet\nAnd this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is\nIt seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was both hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises one not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd as he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and gently grabbed the heel of his book [laughter]\nThink about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong in this measurement nobody sits there trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ...\nI don't know Seventeen\nSomething had to have tremendous height and reach\nBut the amazing thing about that story was\nThe way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boots\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when you look down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost all what that is I just wanted him to know that they can do that that it could sneak up on him and grab is blue\nAnd then left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know the name of your book big put her in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot I take I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\nIs it ... is it not enough terrified to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder of the road or is it more terrifying to have one linking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people are a lot of the encounters a somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily\nBut then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion\nThese things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion the chasing the people out\nThey want them to the region and so they they\nDon't want them there and I think if you push the envelope a you're going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to him [laughter] he gave them one\nBy telling you right now George that big foot if I see that big foot I'm going to get wheels like pop up on a Kansas [laughter] we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a

fourth position and I've been in jets Kevin opposition where um I was attacks there was a ...\nA in a doctor's office in fact and then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation\nOn so I Would have believed her if she had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you creep you did this to me and if he had taken her demeanor and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was in high school I wouldn't put the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I would have started mantra on your show right now Dianne Feinstein last resign\nNah I appreciate it eight five five forty Laura ah let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\n[noise] um I I just wanted to say I think um everyone tries to say so many people said a doctor for ... testimony was credible\nBut that's because it's the polite thing to say it's the politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists\nI think anybody that looks at her testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible and Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social law and he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here\nI appreciate it a five five forty Laura aw Vince is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history is not the most difficult\nOf it in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous cooperation who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it and same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it we know people who practice emotional extortion\nA political extortion this is a this is like an emotional terrorism\nSo conservative need not apply because if you ever had a beer

starts talking about it a and says look this could be your father your brother's time she's getting its gory ate it and the media\nOr they're saying he he's attacking a victim how did you take it\n[noise] well I agree with the president hundred percent but you know the war all women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case you know a doctor for one of the you know I don't know the woman but she was\nYou know a doctor for what you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leaked it and exposed it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who was putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAnd Lou everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake favorite our in the elevator and then you get these ladies are yelling at me it turns out the woman into ... executive director of\nOf the Soros funded group as you said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables where okay sunshine on you who are you people who are working for this organization\nAre carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a good lawyer the plaintiff lawyer could do this or just good good litigation attorney could do this this kind of a\nIt's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there are inherent in civil rights and totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nThere apps get up and absolutely harass them\nNancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on and tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep where they work until they stopped being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and it if it doesn't do anything else that should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats have been playing off is for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party and wrote and and go in\nFor a lawyer up and say you don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator for do uh there's so much a that is happening ... which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been a ... ... only negative um because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to I mean we had this NAFTA deal pass okay or or or be on the ocean as a pastor's son\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big uh ... uh\nObama ridiculed I'm going to maybe the way this magical I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work a and and you must hear nothing on this huge alone milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it is part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero tariffs we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea this presence agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the office talking about what's working in this gender before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to\nTry to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant\nOkay this is a new on tolerant that anyone in my family and my kids they they they better be they'd been it'd be really reading because this is I'm not intimidated by some rich kid who lives at home with his parents than in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders\nOkay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your your activism\nOn the side and I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's where we are going to be under the this week and it starts right here in the United States Senate people who are supporting this actively encouraging and citing it we have a state representative\nThat actually was in ... involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people\nWho are ... without a doctor for it or anything else they are paid activists this\nIs a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them instead\nThe George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them and stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nYou think we have enough Republican money bags types to counter the effort of satire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars in Newark and to voter registration and to a educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nUh this is you know they're going to the the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh\nTrump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this tight governor's race which is really disturbing Stacey Abrams Abrams who's lost\nWeight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's awakened the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race and George has drawn thirty million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia steal that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday it seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense that a judge I'm tapping on gave ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of the ...\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected ended the he was in dignity and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it's not convenient for the Democrat I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just this the tip of the spear of what their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia and going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was a poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit unlikely voters hum and it was basically a forty five forty five\nDead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons in state of Georgia a and the growth economic growth and Georgia's been very strong but what could a left wing governor due to that gross\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants all these give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else is confused issue Georgia right and it was rated the best state in the country and what to do business and she wants to tear that down\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian ... is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little a little bit of an awakened awakening during the Senate entire cabinet deal I think camp should make that's a huge issue down there and push push this uh this Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out in the cabinet thing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "03"}
