comment and then jumping back on the air you know what's going on here right it's it's just a wonderful evening and we're talking about Egypt and the great pyramid somebody pinch me it just doesn't get any better unless of course\nYou're watching beyond belief with George ... you need to check it out go beyond belief dot com\nOr George gets into all of it everything that we talk about here on

unlimited access to beyond belief where you can watch it anywhere you can watch it on your computer iPhone eye pad and the cool thing\nYeah no absolutely that it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a um I'm gonna get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina very welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry the jurors\nGo great Cathy\nYou liked that minute you liked that area [laughter] okay I\nAm today or I always love hearing is that all that you may have more do you place great for me to have the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I got two crashes and then I've got a great little short green quick joke about their armored tower just sit there and\nThe first question they asked her is credited with Jimmy ... deciphering\nAnd learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is all Howard graphics around\nAnd then the second question is all the ... go back repair and Egypt in that area of the world the same hieroglyphics that are found and the pyramids of Mexico central and South America\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are your list here were lipic inscriptions in Beckley therapy is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking are the ... that are written all the ... and Egypt on a pair of the civil war and go back with the other to same hieroglyphics that are found on the pyramid is in Mexico and central and South America\nOh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so there there are different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you asking this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the your lipstick inscriptions\nIn decades heavy in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry\nOkay although I'm not an archaeologist I don't have any fancy degrees after my name on it but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones and go back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they in the same I don't know there is an H on the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks and boom boom to are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby are they are they representing zodiac a that a word in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that\nAre they the same I don't know but go back to happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first is the oldest is at the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I call it the army's age I'm the bells and one of the looks like but did that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to ... um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there is a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I've probably might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWill do right here on goes she goes oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me very it was right there but it just disappeared I'll mention it later on in the show thank you bury no\nProblem thank for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this uh are completely jammed up let's get in one more call on all of them yeah let's let's go to this is going to\nGo to my dad in New York my on Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen great guinea and nine and\nI guess I have a two part clay and I'd like to know if he um\nHad you looked at any of that of highly effective highly of any age and I and I'm also I think that might be the one that deals with

cabinet where we got word from Tennessee and also um the what you call I think\nWas that was it was I think we got came up with and to me what they define with the little if not what it is and the African American outlets that I'm thinking that they call it a little odd that arise so they use that time will sell out\nI ride so they can have real oh shah of fat if you follow a ... and I'll let you know like to\nThank you mad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that she just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around on the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... pirates try actually in my book um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this is an ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about a pirate that's I think over sixty foot long uh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe tapes to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um if there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians\nI'm the second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from two of 'em you Jay\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto and Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with a mia with\nThe live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a fixture all so it was picked up graphs\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the ah the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds the Greeks adapting uh the analogy a chemistry coming from Canada\nRight yes ... issue I think she mentioned is so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Crawford game I think there was a we think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or did you\nTake a break right here coached [noise]\nFind out more about tonight just log on to ... am Duncan [noise]\nGiven me [noise]\n\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university offers over one hundred and fifty highly ranked at great programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree as what on campus then wherever you are on your scheduled class the one line except for the most transfer credits for information that's lived took three five five line seven\nLearned for yourself fly off the air is ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line tax live two three five five one five and that's how the ... three five five one second\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBack to coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I got some ... minute save Saturday more talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week\nOn how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a Jay ... and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show either of for me or\nQuestions or comments about Tonight Show either of for me or or my new right there and this question just came in before we get to a a page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coasts audience and and I guess like you're so there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alex Green who is look he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to collect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates a lot to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the court and it's of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinate that Alan ... discovered\nA fall right next to the ... which is next for the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd his you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it is absolutely incredible and we'll have mine coast next month\nOkay so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show\nPossibly six to eight additional chambers where we have been told there are none\nRight right and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun thing you've Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what comes and bring a pound is when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops suddenly there's a depression\nAnd the way he's interpret one of the two ways he interpreted that is a must be a space\nThat allowed that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty fix or quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then that let's go out and so you know there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by them you on again\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this for a second in the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and ah it going up words every body of one of seven a and I'm looking at it here as it continues up these are rose layers of the\nConstruction that have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight yeah and and it was graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just use this illustration is is an old illustration um so that that particular shafted not go to the surface of the wall but\nThe chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words there is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space\nIt designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project there which I did help them find\nThis ... this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being placed I'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what the new on detectors actually do where do they used for\nLight so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when a cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of particle called them you on has created enemy on is\nA negative charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than electron but it can pass through solid matter if it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the defectors below where you think there is something and then uh it show and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yuan will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stolen so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for it then goes beyond will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors play in the grand gallery could they be used to find the the chambers that you are proposing in the ever happened to me\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact role\nAnd I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real but it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that that could be some some of the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nBe that person adopt\nRock you by the council and the ... project ...\nPeople are always looking to invest in a good opportunity so what

I'm I think Robert de ... was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep\nI'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but um but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that um\nI can tell you that the uh you know the world to cruise ships um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth\nCharted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling the quote was a crucial and he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there is another line pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves\nOr into the things that are looking for chambers and then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are it to our space is under this things\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert truck or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um it might be something in it that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to bleed drill right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first as to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced uh five small graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts uh you know did his studies have a couple of years later and Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I of us in marketing or drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and uh\nDrilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so it didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know it's like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really fine map the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then we're try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumors going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally uh\nBut just to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever might be inside a you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that it does things may\nHave been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body yes\nWell if we think we think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a

I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think uh I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in Cosby gloom is one way you can explain or some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum field\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid um I think\nIt's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace it theory like that until I see from solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line route Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake where do you have for a minute\nOr absolute owners Richard ... is really

we mentioned already six to eight voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I have to mention shop you know so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is the logistics basis basically to get the stones up the pyramid and this data from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scandal was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying they could be the logical and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know your your paper uh but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know be that as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh cause the pyramid of coal fool\nIt's it's it's hot spaces inside researchers in the sixties wet the coffers pure of it because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... all we have his

David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's written books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think uh there is\nFor especially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a a into them in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and this is archaeological evidence and well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay's as I heard that surgeon tools were found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a wait a minute Dixon\nUm and he uh and it's now in the British Museum a with a with a ... with a granted ball um but whether or not that was a surgery with you and other

discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I'm more than once you speculated a little bit if you just chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological\nCould be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those are the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm ... I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate now I I'm I'm looking forward to ... I think\nBecause there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end that\nSo in the ... ah the ah the hopeless was known for the center of the worship of the nine major God's this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think uh these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned um but I'm suspecting there could be ... and there are with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if what if that were ever to be found\nUm but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been spaces there that help the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um\nAnd we'll just have to

I see the south side yes um there is\nA ... so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember this correctly or their worst faces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes um\nAnd ah\nBut I mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when it when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published a data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so you'll get a good mind but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not applying chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I'm with you I think uh I think ah there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around and he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looks down on the ground and he sees what do you think is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs the wood picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood and he lifted up and looks and it was an entry way there was a tunnel going straight down\nAnd as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the rear flanked by the tail of the things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw it with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about uh the ... the I think that there is there's there are spaces under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind pouch that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean and is nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a tunnel a that started in the north west corner where the bird uh two was but and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long dead stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex\nThere wasn't supposed to be anything there then ... denied that there were any tunnels there later went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nThere's also a potential halfway from the ... or from the uh the Cyrus shaft\nUm you know that's I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course these Republicans are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom um but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifics\nI'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the ... it's possible that the upper two layers are they taking them but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure and it may connect um but yeah without a probing\nUm nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah and until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of old Cyrus\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of conflict causeway uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you have to start coughing cars submerged in water and the surrounding database and had sort of the shape of the era glove\nFor house I'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and ended the four pillars around and it was fascinating um you know this ah this some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the Hitler that were surrounding the area where this our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the ... the plateau and there was\nThat's right and so in the inventories the right you know we talked about it earlier\nAre so Robert and I think there are the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to to that of style is Irish shop we think it's possible that is referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a\nLate period tune belonging to a no official called um ... cop or something like that I Can't remember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nDo we think we know\nAnd ... before we had to the break ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the ... there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know ah besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things it could be in front of this thing's temple and then the other thing is we I predict inane mentors the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another things\nMaybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the use of ... of course everything they sing west in Beijing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there have been for reasons with a causeway in the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the gays blacks so\nThere is an awful lot of that is behind the uh the pyramid complex facing a west northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction that is represented in the original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of his ally yet or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends and the oval office placement\nUm but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west fields way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows what we're going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back this coast to coast am stay with us\n[noise] um [noise]\nNever misses issue\nNever missed a detail or show or a gift sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free you coast to coast am Duncan\nAnd I miss you have been

produces under pressure five electricity and\nYou may know all of us are already armed and they'd be regarding that you know I've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey energy the tell your current current the Nile is rerouted\nRoute are adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the er the purpose was to generate a electricity\nMalaria let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question\n[laughter] are you ready if I can answer your absolutely\nYou see a you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator of power and energy that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nUh as I said to me last week while he talked about it for years of course I'm wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that as he you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have him on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card let's go to Daryl in Charleston the sea Carol you're up next on coast\nWow Hi Carol hello Carol\n... several years ago\n... national me twice what ... found some artifact I thought oh man found the Cleopatra him all underground oh did you caring about you\nKnow I as far as I Know it I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know but to them is not discover it but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of the research grade\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explain to her every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I'm a you know a social affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to as\nA day after review the application and they may say no and you don't have a record 'em you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I Want it to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nI'm ... and ... ... what they found and I carry and why ... ... national news twice\nYeah and and Carol or one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new\nThat others out there are attracted\nTo you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I I encourage that I encourage blogging and creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end let's uh let's go east um\nAnd look what happens in the end let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next tacos\nThank you how you doing and I know a thing over participating or what I what I wanted to know like the gentleman that called before a saying that there wasn't a bird or something\nOn the ... picks on on the the the\nTwo of the team but there was also one in in a team how cruel and there was a little one the met people\nIt does make me the same thing in the ... the same thing oh that's a good question and your other question I wanted to know how can we get all this and come up before and you say right off the bat a lot of money it costs a lot of money to do stuff in there\nYeah you're not hearing I'm hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you had brought up a why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where the point

was just like anyone else watching\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert ... and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the Germans were allied with the stars and it's just that that just kind of opens up the up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shark or a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing\nUm a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those at length tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the row a new is the first and so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight\nUh you and a Robert football and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the strings and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah what you know this is a this goes back to override mystery so I you know while I was reading things I haven't met the two gentlemen and yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah built the pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three belt stars for why and they had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great care of it the first of all of the three it was you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue is probably look at the statue of humor when they were looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while at so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I noticed that and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in ...\nIt on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dream Steeler which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThat was a a so he was talking basically lots of things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the Puritans were built if there was this famous than it's it would have been such an amazing monument that there should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the lioness on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the use of my own general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut not documented the anywhere in Egypt history where you would think\nWell you know the ... love to write everything and he loved to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes in in accounting and season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the grades things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed um but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or maybe total absence\nUm and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool in front of the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fool key ops was alive and if you walk into that to him do is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup food and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually Humphries pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and Google's pyramid was called the rise of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou're going to the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how was built built in the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it can do all\nThe way to her ... um you know fifth century but to see you know this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plot so and then the pyramid was done in Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up the blocks that\nYou would think that he'll just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this\nUh it's not the or the other part of this or that is just too confusing is the great things we also have the same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a\nWhile and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes that\nWas the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be close to Fort who is the author of the dream still up between the part of the things that he used to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to cooperate but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that he definitely does not say that you built it\nUh and so that's the dream still at the event towards the all the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that what ... what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as it keeps the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that the mentors the likes

the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery\nI Know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by things\nAnd these pictures are um you know they're on mistake of all\nSo so the opposite of questions specific of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things

authors\nUm I I was a you know I thought to myself if\nIf an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with a three belt starts off Iran they had to be some

was funny that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second sings a as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and do you participate in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things\nAre and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these pictures are um you know there are unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques\nSo they're they're terribly was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but it's there it's things buried under the fence or that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\nTeam in Georgetown Law you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repairs is being but build the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy but and then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most is your pauses do not accept the inventories the la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm they're the uh you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to me means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a bad\nOr so that becomes the combination is that we have if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip affects where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and the the verb ... this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the fires of ... that was found in ... in the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is my ... talks about tour store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that\nIt was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who was a ... interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up the courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives are you a pyramid like who who is dealing with uh also one of the ... watts riot could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramids\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes yes there is\nA there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is with the news and so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pyramid for her the southern most of the three ah off the three a queen permits that are on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in the mentors though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying\nThere is no evidence they knew it was a princess so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think the poop shows that she was a princess\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then do you and your oh there's mentions of ISIS and hop or a an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why each opposes reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an oath getting them story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know as as an aside as we're not yet a work being worship there weren't not official states sanctions a ... and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same hands with the same pair\nFlight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect to be justice allegation is even you know more complex yeah but they're not and there don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the parents after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle king of pure ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive you didn't have to drill olds you didn't have to you know like ah ah the early explorers they used\nThey have to you know like a a

I Believe tapes to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians um\nSecond part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly fanatic um and the evidence from that comes from two um UGA\nA king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt or probably from Bhutto and Bhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with a mia with the live on\nAnd so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up perhaps\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... maybe I'm maybe even further south and that\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds the Greeks adapting uh the analogy a chemistry coming from Canada\nRight yes the issue I think she mentioned his face so uh my uh we we think this thinks was making before uh before Crawford game I think there was a we would think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or did you\nTake a break right here coast to coast a damn it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get my news saves on day his paper is right there click on his website a coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us [noise]\nFind them more budget nice gifts log on to ...

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I get tonight and Manu saves the day we're talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week\nAnd how to locate them and I wanted to say really quick minute then Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a Jay ... impose your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to hand in\nHeaven yes um I haven't I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience\nAnd and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alex Green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to collect uh the uh the title age of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates a lot to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it'd ever write a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically a the the coordinate Thad Allen is discovered\nA fall right next to the ... which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month and it is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation but that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have among coast next month\nSo okay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to the it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show\nPossibly six to eight additional chambers where we have been told there are none\nFive right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a pound is when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the four off of the of the canal drops probably if there's a depression\nAnd the way he isn't perfect one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space\nThat allow that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with or if I go back to three twenty six will quick\nThat could correlate with the course that marked with twenty fifth um and and then that let's go out and so you know there was some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by me on again\nNow the row let's let's let's get to this for a second\nHe rode mutts or let's let's get to this first second and the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting in a row eighty four which is\nA shaft 'em and are you going up words every body of one of seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction than to have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration does is an older list ration I'm so that it that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yeah so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words there is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space\nAnd designed space that correlates with each one of these particular course you\nKnow you just got back from Egypt yes\nWe have to discuss the ongoing move on a project there which I did help them find the cavity there's new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being place um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that they are scouting\nNow for the audience tell them what the ... on detectors actually do where do they use for\nWhites are these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you want is created and then you on as\nA negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier or didn't electron but it can pop through solid matter if it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray the pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then a show and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yuan will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the pathway of what you're what you're looking for it then goes beyond will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors played in the grand gallery could they be used to find the ... the chambers that you were proposing and the ever happen to the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe ought to factual\nAnd I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real what it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of\nScan that yes that there could be some some of the lower once maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nUh-huh what kind of time or even now how we asked my family has a camera on them right now it's time to rain rain

I don't know you know if when you when a antiquities goes and investigate those things and their own published that data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I'm with you I think uh I think ah there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looked down on the ground and he sees what do you think is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs would mix it up and it's a a piece of plywood and he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way there was a tunnel going straight down\nAnd as he was looking into the whole a guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what\nI personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the\nSouth side of the rear flanked by the scale of the things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw it with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about uh the ... the I think that there is there's the ours basis under this things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind pouch that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean it is nerve wracking and if you got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was but and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long dead stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then I Want to or denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again was supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential pathway from the site or from the uh the oath Irish shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course he's your poses are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the old Cyrus shop it's possible that the upper two layers are they taking them but the the\nLower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure and it may connect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of old Cyrus\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of conflict causeway uh and then that's how you\nIt's on the south side of the ... of conflict causeway uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you have to start coughing cars submerged in water and the surrounding database and that sort of the shape of the Iraq with\nFor a house I'm a and a and you know it had this conference inside and and the the four pillars around and it was fascinating ah you know this ah some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet in the in the Hitler that were surrounding the area where there are ... again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to do something to keep the plateau and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the right you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think there are the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to\nTo that or ... or Cyrus shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that or chemicals to now mock later is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to a no official called um ... cop or something like that\nI Can't remember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nYou know we don't think we know\nThe ... before we had to the break or how much do you think is still love to be discovered on the ... there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert's favorite place to look would be a besides the you know uh besides that left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage that\nWe think is under the things it could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict in towards the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite place and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another things maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the ... of course everything they sing west in Beijing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there have been for reasons with a causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau there is an awful lot of that is behind the uh the ... complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction that is represented in the original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nA with a huge trends and this oval ... placement\nUm but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fat and potentially\nAnd who knows where we are going to be able to on earth them\nWe'll be right back this was coast to coast am stay

just it's such an important time\nFor research and what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up or some of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last segment here let's go east of the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nA M ordering new for thought I was born in ...\nA good morning Larry and how were you in the hurricane were you okay\nUh where I'm located Irma got me but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but he he he was a such a wide big storm that it it it affected everything up north they're\nA feel for those people that they've lost everything\nYeah yeah so you guys were okay over on that side war\nWere good on that side we've got a little weather but rain and whatever but we're good\nAll right Larry what do you have for my new\nSomething quick a Edgar Edgar Casey reading Edgar Casey on that land if it's a it's a paperback right it might be interested in reading your does life reading a first for the march Nineteen sixty eight\nBut he talked about between ten thousand eleven thousand period um the migration of the carpet in return and then vote voted in Concord Egypt\nOne of the leaders of this trial was ... or Edgar Casey with rain carbonated of course\nI'm ... all are wanting to say we're basically the chamber of the ... and I miss you can train for it it's not a to write a according to written as you might check that out at the very end lightning\nAnd the original capstone with courts um ... the pyramid pyramid has granted in it which produces under pressure five electricity\nAnd you may know all that's already happened and they'd be written that\nI've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey\nEnergy that tell your current earth currents of the Nile is rerouted it did route uh adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose was to generate a electricity well\nLarry let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question are you ready if I can answer absolutely\nIf the uh you\nKnow and Christopher down and others have talked about uh the the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator of power and energy that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nUh as I said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that is he you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview\nYou know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston ... do you see Carol you're up next on coast\nHow Hi Carol hello Carol\n... several years ago\n... national news twice that they found some artifact and thought oh man found the Cleopatra him almost ... underground oh did you hear anything about you\nKnow I as far as I Know it I I I haven't looked into this in detail as far as I Know the two of us not discovered but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nAnd what was your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with one of every third grade [noise]\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explain to her every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course if a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I'm a you know associated affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to as a day after review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse um you know so we'll have to see if they allow us but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think\nYou know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nI'm ... and ... ... what they found an out of carrion why nothing out there than added that and they sit in a national needed twice\nYeah and and Carol ... one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog right research and and and publish and self publish yourself and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and certainly so does my new\nThat others out there are attracted\nTo you and they will find your information and then they start sharing their information would do and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I I encourage that I encourage blogging\nAnd creating your own website just like my new and and look what happens in the end let's let's go east and the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next tacos man you\nDon't do you how you doing and I know a thing over but participating or what I what I wanted to know like the gentleman that would be

hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money that's where the devil does point but the first\nOr the birds that are represented throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramids and right and we're seeing it over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that uh
