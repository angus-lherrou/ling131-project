is still for me one of the greatest UFO stories of abductions I've ever read it is one of the reasons I got into this business\nBecause it wouldn't look magazine came out with the interrupted journey the story of Barney and Benny Hill I mean I was just mesmerized even at a young age how would you categorize that case the Barney and video case\nWell I I think it's a very important case and for several different reasons I'm On the people uh we're not talking about people who don't have a reputation\nWe're not talking about people who are trying to seek attention for attention say that he was a social worker or respected member of the community\nShe had a mixed marriage with Barney ... she was white that was very unusual in the early sixties it took guts for them to\nCome out that's right and they were\nVery concerned about what the reaction would be a ... this was in the early sixties\nAnd you know it got a ... if you're going to have people who set a new standard\nOf what's going on ... you got to have people who can handle the heat's speak it's unfortunate that Barney didn't live terribly long tide when Nineteen sixty eight I guess and uh I'm\nBetty I'm Around a long time for which I Am glad and uh it was a good case to set the ball rolling so to speak on the whole business of abductions and interactions with early\nNot sensational live I mean let's face it stand back and say very Varney where specimens for somebody yeah\nAnd they weren't melt treated but they certainly weren't going off and glory and claiming all kinds of Nazi things as being part of their interaction with the aliens and\nYou know I I was fortunate to have the opportunity to meet them early on\n... ... and I was very impressed uh and I was impressed by something else uh the media\nIn that case a K in Pittsburgh biggest station in town and uh uh you know I I that's where I made my view on the air so to speak\nAnd they called me and told me that they were bringing Betty and Barney in town and told me where they were staying and which is very unusual you know and I contacted them we had dinner together\nOr just the three of us and I had a chance to you know one on one kind of thing and I was very very impressed and I had known what to expect for hadn't film stuff like this I mean\nIt isn't that crazy story aliens grabbing a couple a an interracial couple\nIn those days you were just getting into this field weren't you\nWell yeah I mean you have you done a pretty early on was early yeah\nIn the sixties and it's no longer in the sixties or seventies or eighties [laughter] that's right no till I was very fortunate to have met them one on one\nSo to speak and sorting them at conferences I didn't get too many meetings with Barney 'cause he died within two years when I first met him a less than that\nIn two years when I first met him a lesson that a very who's gone on and of course I work very closely with that is nice Kathleen Martin and we've done three books together [noise] and uh\nThat's been a pleasure to a if not often you find it can break with people uh have a co written ... books with other people but uh we seem to be compatible\nYeah you you you too clicked and she's great in the field and you follow due to a ... super pushing you don't gamble when I was that Twenty one year old reporter who interviewed you one of the other interviews I did was with Dr Benjamin Simon who who is the psychiatrist who\nWho studied Benny in Barney hill and this is I'll I'll always remember this because he was in Boston I interviewed him over the phone I'm In Detroit\nAnd in a you know I'm I'm obsessed with the story and I asked him I said so what do you think Dr\nA ball they're telling you the truth or not what do you think in he said I don't know if the story happened or not but I Will tell you what I Do believe\nThey're they're not lying whatever happened to them both of them ... under hypnosis separately told the same story\nAnd they they believe whatever they saw happened to them and he said based on that I cannot say what happened but I can tell you they aren't lying to me in a what an amazing story\nYeah ... we have to remember that the doctor Simon random facility for three thousand shell shocked war veteran\nYes called the ...\nWay before anybody would get involved and stuff like that\nYeah and he had learned to use of those as as a means of bringing guys who've had terrible experiences you know your buddy said on off next year battle\nA that's traumatic but weeds and so he learned how to handle this and so they were very fortunate and winding up his hands\nAnd you know I I'm Still not sure exactly what he finally thought about the whole business\nBut he surely thought that these people are an outline that's right they're not looking for attention cetera et cetera\nI was impressed with him and uh I was impressed with that ... to ... and ... unfortunately but they they were they had nothing to gain a mixed

yeah I have Lord's Prayer\nCarved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been change so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make

another one\nIs a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the video said\nThat Isaiah eleven six have been changed now I say I love and six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings uh songs Elvis sang about it I it is the scripture that
