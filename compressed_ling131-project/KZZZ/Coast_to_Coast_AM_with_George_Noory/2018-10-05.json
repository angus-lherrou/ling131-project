awesome it's part of the uh the conjuring movies so far I'm the one of those yes to Greg I'm what I called you about is uh what's your thoughts on the fog and Santa has them which are two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties and\nAh I I absolutely love fans have them up and pass them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who may fan passive smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot fans has them\nAnd um and when they when a cost to rally a you know it took him almost a really long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage for the film\nAnd um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I kinda hearkens that sort of blend of fantasy side by and horror that you see\nIn a lotta later uh eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screened villains of all time uh and the fog is\nTruly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian ... great ghost story about um the lepers or a Nineteen eighty comeback\nBut the goal but through the fog uh it's just a so good you know are just so many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed\nTo be um Donald pleasant but I I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpenter's films hallelujah being one of\nThem uh they live being one of them the fog won't let them one of them so I mean John John Carpenter\nYou know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if there\nWere these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I spoke to the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom you know you have the right distribution absolutely\nThough so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see them more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot to uh the slight I think it's very easy to over produce for I think it's a horror movie has too much money and it\nIt will protect it you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it\nIt stopped flew more like a surprise and and if you can keep the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living Dead Sea grant a\nAre incredibly scary and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror films\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier\nAround he really is [laughter]\nAnd uh you know and and I you know I got to

think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night\nThey're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that they are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nUh it's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams too\nOld while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience

the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body that can access to other mind bodies or suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness experience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to do a

documentary by that title and he was the one that I was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like Marilyn let's make a movie and I thought well wouldn't want to make a movie with the ... Oprah and then I went to bed at night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explained that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually although the world that's a whole interesting thing\nTo in terms of future science you know we see now that all of this cloning is

start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn hogwash life after death knocked continue when we die ... ... what\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're going to end up and\nAh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of an lightened meant um may end up through in a\nYou know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past\nAre now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed\nThey start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nHe's the skeptics used the skeptic the well known skeptic he's also you know really spark guy very interesting and a nice car guy\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that one has mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really love you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's an interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting that God's ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or has\nA now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of\nEntrenched position of skepticism\nWhoa what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests were the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than the bunker\nI think so too and I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work in our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we

take your calls next hour with Dr Merrill Lynch ... author of debts makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\n[noise] well there's so many stories but I'm\nJust want him to step birth march or something like that right well Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who\nA very strong in chest and trying to document cases\nVery strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit of where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but are evident shawl but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had founded and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers or I used to change your diapers\nAll and\nIt was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid's started\nRemembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and\nThey asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death\nBut these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\n... luggage truly remarkable ... remember the study of the little boy who claimed that he was World War two pilots\nAnd she knew things were both the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his ... and the and the doctor ... and they took him to a reunion a a World War two veterans and he knew shovel of people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the up to ...\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle mantey um um this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets and they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody develops this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nA mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but\nBecause you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there's been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely\nThey have and it has been shown to be extremely\nUseful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity they have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author and researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... users black Milan ... to do a lot of ... that's\nRight and that's really strange uh-huh for the ... interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you would have Marilyn then you do get you in touch with her on her website is visionary living dot com you might be streamed through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but\nHow those ideas and beliefs and form how we live now and you know we know that people\nUh believe different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of ration rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nActually our special guest Dr Merrill Lynch ... we're talking about the really things dealing with ... how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the pressure\nI think it's a tricky question I'm\nOf course in warm weather [laughter] that about you\nGeorge ah I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they define God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... while as long as you're eligible to of course\nRight hell and damnation can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't a God\nPer se but there's this idea of\nYou know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm a beautiful journey toward something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we

said and um [noise] I have the proof that\nThere is the other side George when my husband\nPassed away six years ago he leaves on non believer it was a good question but doesn't believe in spirits and thanks I haven't been\nListening to you know all of the programs from way back when I was on and his wife and you yes and I had this experience and I don't know who who tell them to some time now my husband of course who is a known believer\nI'm sure he passed away about just three days\nUm but before this happened on the surface burial service so on and you know just says he was going down into the ground yeah those farm came up\nAnd view it was wild and when and everything has just happened so fast and then it stopped it took only a few minutes it was very odd now as we were leaving the cemetery my son the oldest one\nSaid mom when we were getting into the car to go home dad came home with us I said what do you mean\nHe got in the car also because they could just smell him call was filled with his body odor and my husband was very clean person but he had this sense about him he was in a smoker and nothing but here comes my son said that\nAnd I just go\nBut then a few nights pass Ali sleeping at my left foot but still bothering me from the accident we had that serious a skill later and um\nI was on and say no I followed my left foot going up in the air\nAnd there was my husband at the end of the bed lifting my left foot\nWhile you could see him\nOh beautiful yes yes yeah he always wore his white T shirt visited the neck and short yeah the ten short and on and he passed away before he could hit Ninety four\nSo sorry for Renault was\nOh he wasn't perfect specimen that doctors always says what do you do for a decade ago Seventeen year old man in Ninety three is a little\nI said nothing he does it all the exercises you know and walk and he watches his diet my husband never had a wrinkle on him but George this is this thing he'd pull my leg up and I woke up and I said you know and I looked at him I sitcom that sports\nIt my foot hurt and he says I Want you to take\nCare of this sport you see the doctor and and he dropped it and that was it it was very upset that I wasn't they\nCan go to the doctor after that\nYes I have been but the thing is George my mother also came to visit him I said no he lives in non believers as I Do with you but they are able churchgoers good Christian Protestant but\nThey even taught Sunday school is that the doctor in but the thing is\nHe told me after seven years this happened he says Alice\nYong mother came to visit me I said when when we lived on them I won't mention the street but I said why didn't you tell me after the seven year you're telling me he said I didn't want to tell you\nThis I said well it was all about what she stood at the end of our bed and and he got up and there she was standing at the end of the bed and mom what what is it you know and\nHe says well Tom I wanted to know how Alice isn't doing because I was six months pregnant when she passed away and she was concerned homeland helpless knowing he passed away much first she was only fifty for\nSomething to how old are you know I'm not into four Ninety four good for you\nAnd I'm the senior George I haven't been wind called several times because we listen to you every night my son and I and he's a believer now like you know\nAnd then I and Asia believe right now like you know it wasn't a believer slide it to go but isn't listening to your own rent and he has changed and full of wonderful he leaves afterlife and so he's not afraid of that thing on just like me\nBut I have no\nOther children who are not relievers they just go\nTo church all the time but you know those who don't believe\nYeah they don't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having just first attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything if my dad says just you know\nHow would you what were you raised ... we were raised as just full of hot kiss your church is right here right in your heart no formal ... you have to go to a certain church never my dad with my dad was a Roman Catholic\nMy God like Nelson lives also and they were the Catholic they restrict it became a father and\nAnd um and then they decided that could end in his late seventies he wanted to become a Bush is an issue as I said that what happened they said because the British people don't go to war\nThey don't think it'd be fighting all the time was\nWhen you read the Bible you know it's always fighting on George you know the Bible I I have read the Bible to into law school and everything but\nThe thing is this happening to me when I was seven years old 'cause my two girlfriends were Catholic that went to the Sacred Heart church and a\nWhile I was in there I was in the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock masks on Sunday and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you get neglect to confession and I can eat also but there are lot while they were getting dark confession done\nAnd uh I was sitting there that's if you\nAnd I pass out your passion I cashed out my neck fell on the back of the few you know so I my breathing was cut off each you could have died I yeah\nI was that's when I met the ages I mean this is something that to this day you know and even the priest when they came to get me to have a ... a child I was gonna\nUm but you've been through a lot to me when when my two girlfriends well right yeah and they came up to me when they came back\nThey said oh this is\nAnd you know what Jesus was already late outstretched and and the angel behind him you know when George I have never seen anything so beautiful my life and we never had color t._v. or you've only had was a radio at home they sort of back into thirty\nMore so than those news that's on Thursday\nAnd no I tell you what I got it all and colors and when I hear your caller called in to say they they ... they had been up and came back I find it very difficult to believe some of the story because my it was not one that I knew what he looks like\nYours was a good business beautiful\nGeorge and Jesus is so true\n[laughter] I Love hey we're going to take a quick break in a moment Marilyn that was recalled Ninety four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things I pull things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive and so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours\nWhere people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they have these experiences and there's something to it\nThere's no doubt about that Marilyn we're going to go back and take final phone calls with you just a moment in Dallas you keep calling us from want you to get the Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven too long\nThat

I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question I I we evolve ing toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity in technology but I'm more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese\nAnd we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption\nAnd you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or you know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly ...\nAltruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on that\nI think eventually good beach out over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative and the little um huge yeah I'm a little skeptical of how\nMuch we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the ... in the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nNow one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that ah we know as people grow older\nAh there is this concern that we lose memory\nBut at the same time we gain wisdom\nSo it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go to first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nVillage okay\nI just wanted to call because I had this story that I have a\nI was listening to Maryland and uh normally listen deal might not ever have anything to say\nYou know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle and I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember getting hit by the truck\nI remember hitting the ground and then the next room or a have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I look down and I can see a circle of people around me laying on the ground\nAnd I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you have something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own ... instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience and it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the new ... new organization scores named after one ... science is well what is the ... experience\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about how what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reason to kind of this course and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we know but intuitively we know it\nAnd that often can be the most reliable source of guidance for us even though it doesn't have the rational logical kind of

I mean I don't know if I classify shining the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and I and I and I am a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty are you know the rainiest Twenty years old you know\nHow are you know the ... is Twenty years old you know so um [noise] you know it's a ... you know a lot of 'em are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well with age and I I really I think a Halloween with first Halloween\nIs really a a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent as kind of like the captain kept trying to stop this uh\nYou know maniacal a killer actually not even an article that someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original hollowing imagine it's been that long like gosh\nUh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of a thing and asking for your care in a bunch of other uh [noise] or films a science fiction\nA heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and the babysitter killer and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story Halloween store kick them and uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing\nThey were trying to come up with a scary math and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek mass and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's that's a lawyer Shatner Matt Good Larry I'm I Wonder how bill feels about that yeah I don't know\nUh but uh you know ... and so what you know the fact that it's such a blank you know expression on the math and and and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they tried to car you're talking about the conjuring and\nSome of 'em there was a family of films there's an a bell which uh you know the original dolled at the Warren are having their a basement full of uh object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of your Halloween you know and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stall for two seconds you know there are like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the bat you know much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that there are little ... gonna\nGonna try to possess them or haunt them or hurt that\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started to leave that either and that's been ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of seen as she got kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with short\nHair right she ... Frank Sinatra's protege\nAnd that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle want it to make that movie you know William Castle was the producer\nOf course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know all all I could emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel the buzzer is in the seats and the uh uh uh you know all of these are moving\nGimmicks of a house on the hill and uh um you know straight jak classics\nHold on for a second Mr ... we're in a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nDo have a photo that you think would you go to ... we're always honk for unique an unusual images for a photo gallery to submit your image simply go to ... am dot com and most of the media button on the upper navigation bar submission option [noise]\nBut yet when I was a kid [noise] uh I was terrified of these I mean I I I was like\nIn my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table shaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of a kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island\nI Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's ... you know and we were watching a movie like that and I think what a lot of these movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching the movie the kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watch when creature feature right next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometimes\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl ... different

know so uh you know that was kind of first of the sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that that movie was a that was the director hat final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happens do they read a really great job\nOf not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and uh you know you nowadays I think that'd be hard to do because\nOf the Internet

gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dreams skate which I think came the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nAny on any of them were never they\nGo five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I

hair\nAnd he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I I didn't really I mean it just it didn't I never really believe that the ... but that wasn't the part of that is why I didn't like that it seemed like a two hour zone\nWalk commercial where it was just this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it [noise]\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think it's you you sir you won I think there's two there's two aspects of the roller coaster you know there's

and things like that you\nKnow I like those movies I think the shining is actually a an excellent ghost story a you know in addition to uh being I guess it's not ... I mean I don't know if I classify shining the slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and ... and that good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty hire a you know the ring is Twenty years old she you know so um [noise] you know it's a\n... you know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween but first Halloween\nIs really a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent\nA a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant this really excellent as kind of like the captain kept trying to stop this uh\nYou know maniacal a killer actually not even an article\nThat someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween blue magic and it's been that long like gosh uh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of a thing and less from New York here and have a bunch of other\nA horror films a science fiction\nA heat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of a scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers\nAnd and the babysitter killer and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story Halloween store kicked in and uh the character\nBecame so popular um the mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary math and and what they ended up doing was taking her William Shatner Star Trek mass and spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's that's a lawyer Shatner Matt Good Larry\nI'm I Wonder how real feels about that yeah I don't know uh but uh you know ... and so what you know the fact that it\nTook a blank you know expression on the math and and and not deliberately scary face\nA you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are newer movies they try to heart you're talking about the conjuring and some of 'em there was a family of failed there's an a bell which uh you\nKnow the original dolled up the Warren are having their a basement full of uh object\nIs Iraq at the end all and we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of spirit Halloween you know and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know no one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the bat you know much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that\nThere are little ... gonna gonna try to possess them or haunt them her birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that story leave that either and that's ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of you know she kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with a short hair\nShe ...\nFrank Sinatra's protege\nAnd that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William\nCastle want it to make that movie William Castle was the producer of course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know all like emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel with the buzzer is in the seats and the uh uh uh you know all of these uh movie gimmicks\nOf a house on the hill and uh um you know straight jak classics\nHold on for a second Mr Lovell we're at a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nLike in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under a coffee table\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of a kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the real you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching my dad and I think what a lot of you will get the bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind of on the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching movies the kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature feature right next to him are hiding behind the recliner sometime [noise]\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just hand but they had this very convincing hand ... different body hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I ... and it bothered me so much to my dad you know if the robbery and a fake bill with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and ... and I'm sure that they usually had raw but but put into this perspective of weight there\nBut but it put into this perspective a wait there this is fun time they're playing this is a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something to make a ... this isn't something to just the torture me this is this is something for fun and\nI think it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it ... and not just for all of you know where I feel is is that under horror anti fi I think are under the bigger umbrella of fantasy though uh\nI think the horror ... is an offshoot of fantasy and so it's fine I I like all of that I like a John or movies I like a you know monsters\nAnd a robot and inches and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid\nI I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old is too long ago yeah and then of course the scary one for me I was nine years old the house on the haunted deal with the original one with Vincent Price right I mean\nHow hot wire blind woman and the seller man I thought\nHe would really do all these movies now I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go ... [laughter] well when he just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too yeah and then the T. V. shows he would love to see\nScience fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you have them on all the time I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWell sure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and uh you know all sorts of things\nYou know I think that that the curiosity for this a cult in the supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the seed of a lot of um your your guests on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four much\nYou know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre ... has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou'd think there is you think there is and I think the area to write you know and you go back and watch it\nYou know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and the chainsaw and the little how weird their house\nWas with all the the mold mobiles phones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it those were really I think they're really sloppy flat dash\nYou know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because they know when I was going to go here\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho lose shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not one to ... did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point of the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think at a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of melons that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons and Hitchcock is getting her ... channel watching this down guy you know making all these weird hollow strange down having all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter]\n... governments say a word and happy to walk out the door he just says his top\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know they were uh unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up vomit every single night his job he couldn't handle it because ... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because\nPeople hadn't had become accustomed to the found footage\nFirst person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUm you know so uh you know that was kind of first of the sort of found footage type films and an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but you know that in that movie was a that was the director hat\nThe movie but you know that that movie was a that was the director hat final cut and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDry then they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they read a really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but creating a a a a story that people wanted to believe in and uh you know you and nowadays I think I'd be hard to do\nBecause of the Internet it gives you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine\nA fool with everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhen did you think of Freddie Krueger the nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kinda just\nGreedy and came out in Nineteen eighty four eighty four\nBut you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream scape which I mean kingly year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right ah but ah yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and and uh\nWith any on any of them whenever they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nWho's a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw did you got a weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the bottom of Duke\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bother to pretty much did it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing with the grief a of a loss of of a spouse\nOr whatever and a father um and I think it's manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know you've got like a top hat and kind of ... kind of hair and he's a cartoons out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it just it didn't I never really believed that Bob but that wasn't the part of that is why\nI didn't like that it seemed like a two hours don't walk commercial where it was just this allegory for their depression and their Greece and that you you don't ever really escape your grief you just have to feed it\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally like to be scared\nUm you know I think it's you you sir you won I think there's two there's two aspects to roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to get you get All right you get on a roller coaster and you'd have so much fun but you want to get back on it again\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in a for effort want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and they're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you you're safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing we'll things in real life that really do terrified and I think that that that's worth the price of admission by itself\nMore than one million wild animals are killed each year

he got paid with a painting of Michael Jackson [laughter]\nThat was probably worth something [laughter]\nNext up let's go to chip peas in North Carolina forty nine years old chip do you\nGo to movies I'm Sorry you go to movies\nDid yesterday yesterday I just saw the ... super too long ago and uh on my list that I haven't seen it yet\nOh it's awesome it's part of the uh the conjuring responsibilities so for me I Love those yes to great um what I called you about is uh what's your thoughts on the fog and sand tabs on what your two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties\nTwo of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties uh I I absolutely love fans has 'em a fan's has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who may fan passive smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot bans has them\nAnd um and when they when a cost to rally or you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage for the film\nAnd um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by an were and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I think it kinda hearkens that sort of blend of fantasy side by and horror that you see in a lot of later uh eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains of all time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere a digging bar both great go story about um the lepers or\nA Nineteen eighty to come\nBack for the gold look through the fog or it's just a so good you know are are so many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um\nDonald pleasant but I I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John Carpenter so Halloween being one of\nThem are they live being one of them the fog lawn them one of them\nSo I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imaginative filled\nWith these inexpensive movies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom you know you have the right distribution absolutely\nSo so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the more interesting it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the less the shark you see them more effective job was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the slight it's very easy to over produce for I think it's a horror movie has too much money and it\nIt will protect it you know you look the second Terminator movie you know if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one because it's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film\nYou know you almost need the cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's thought flew more like a surprise and and if you eat and eat the train coming down the track\nNo one is gonna you know one shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be a slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why\nA lot of low budget horror films like not in the living dead\nSea grant a are incredibly scary and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell has made a living doing lower budget horror films\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier oh really is [laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he's charming guy and uh you know he uh\nHe loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to check the likes\nOf paycheck absolutely you know and uh I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chaplain where it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that feeling for him a cemetery in things like that yeah\nYeah I mean I I like Stephen king's films a lot more than the books I I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean a dance is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a padded too long winded you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man\nBut you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps writing he he's just as surprised as we are because he just keeps writing and drinking and riding until it finished you know and uh\nYeah and drinking and writing and finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it done\nSo there's NO PLAN going in\n... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again ... ... there was no formula so I can create I think that that's why his books are so surprising\nBut I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of oil back down to it asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with for like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean walking here definitely I feel like owns everything right of the living yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart when you see that [laughter] you know or the rubber ears that you hang around your neck or the\nYou know the whatever get inside the signs and you know it it's all um it's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that ah you know like a soap opera\nUm and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to I smoke that I'm In modern zombie movies you know I Know donkey as the enemy that you can shoot and not go out and we don't have you know ... ... ... in the world of revert politically correct world\nThere there are there aren't many a screen villains that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot down mowed down

there are a lot of smaller out that um that that is that do the same and I I I think again it's it's the type of a kind of movie that you can make inexpensively it it doesn't even have to have a big name if people are intrigued by the subject matter they'll go see it\nAnd interesting take the people make movies for YouTube\n[noise] uh people do make movies for YouTube I mean you to having a lot of problems with uh in these right now because uh they're changing a lot of their rules and stuff\nIn favor of their own um you to read which is there um you know there are trying to develop their own

[laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter] I think there's\nJust so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night\nThey're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that they are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nUh it's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nAnd I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines\nOr the Iowa for example or something that they use for big visions so if\nThey want to anticipate what the whole group should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a collective ritual and that includes little kids you know seniors everybody in the whole sort of community participates\nExperiences make you more aware of the possibility of God or to use the word\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God I think that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this encapsulated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies\nOr suggest something vast and I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states of consciousness\nExperience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWhen your argument due to do a lot of different aspects really supernatural image virtual reincarnation things were done you've got some great stories will read\nThe books that you roll back into the mix was possible told me about the targets how did you come up with\nWell I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra a for a film we made a feature\nLength documentary by that title and he was the one that\nI was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like Marilyn let's make a movie and I thought well wouldn't want to make a movie with the ... and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared to do it\nRight and we will eventually although the world that's a whole interesting\nThing to in terms of the future science you know we see now that\nAll of this cloning as happening they've just cloned um eggs\nWell this cloning as happening they've just cloned um eggs that can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri dish his crazy\nIt's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and please you're on a chip watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn hogwash life after death does not continue when we die ... ... what are you saying\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and\nAh so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of an lightened meant um may end up through in a you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at\nThe the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things that seemed completely far fetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple with when I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nIn the ...\nThe well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting\nAnd a nice guy using guy\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that went to his mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well that's an interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he\nGot married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father and grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of\nEntrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important too is a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic watch pool\nRight I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than the bunker\nI Will tune which was ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get to prove\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses\nYou got to Marilyn those roots are good quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work in our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this would also want you

tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories let's um\nThis one had to step Bruce march or something like that right well in Stevenson\nWas a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark ah so it's not a typical mall but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place entry and exit or where the bullet ostensibly went through the body\nAnd so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people\nYou know it's not absolutely evidence but are evidence Shaw but it's still compelling\nOur in our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had found it and he tells the story of a young boy who ah you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a\nI used to change your diapers and it was kind of shocking for these parents ... sure and then this kid's started\nRemembering other things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little testy a parent's got a bunch of pictures from\nThe dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car\nAnd he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive their car and so again it's not definitive evidence that there is the kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death\nBut these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\nThat it's truly remarkable in remember the study of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots and the new things about the plane when it landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew that other than the crew and the pilot and he was telling us\nBut he knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was joined us here in ... in the doctor verified and they took him to a reunion a World War two veterans and he knew several of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the Jews\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle mantey um um this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets\nAnd they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at are gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but\nBecause you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity they have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nAre looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author and researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... users black moon ... to do a lot of\nTime in history really strange uh-huh when the war be interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you would a mirror one then you do get you in touch with her on her website is visionary living dot com you might be more humid was straight through there\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for a website is really not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and beliefs inform how we live now and you know we know that people\nUh believe different things even within a common culture a oh you have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rationed rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that is going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely our special guest Dr Merrill Lynch ... we're talking about the really things really was ... how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the percentage now\nI think it's a tricky question on the Korean War and plenty [laughter]\nThat is that about you and George ah I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they define God to be\nFor example in um the Christian tradition there can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... and if you're eligible to of course\nRight hell and damnation can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition where there isn't a\nGod per se but there's this idea of you know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become a God or that can be a much more um a beautiful journey towards something that allows\nA beautiful journey towards something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nFor you the pole cameras nine to

President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional is that all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the hotel and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the uh this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe then you're anti woman or you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance as a person as being advertised victim\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is it raises every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of sexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here\nAs well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that have really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh\nAnd his shoulders should not be should not be showing the entire me to live in by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary of the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein ... hearing today it was Harvey winds dean major democratic donor\nYou're not going to find him in a picture that Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lot of lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses\nIn Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't have learned that women describing conduct not something thirty six years ... years ago and song corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC or network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so pretty much of an interesting it's so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to ah your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... or ...\nWhy can't you be the egg\nTo land the fabric egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth\nYou say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding a compelling well let's hear yours that's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have just smoke shouldn't hold on I'm not I don't know you hear about you know okay you can't just throw\nThat out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president your reaction to that\nWho I have their reaction to that but I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or or harm or the recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back\nOn and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura uh to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied and won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be believed 'em and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that that I find it to be on basically are relevant and when I talked about the fabric drag which by the way it is trending on social media I Love I Love informing generations that\nOf a new term that may not know it uh but when I was talking about that I was talking about the process if you look at the entire cut that's me talking about how\nRight well I have a right where it was a comedy I write of course I Am so she was talking to I was talking to NBC\nReporters two of them are shouting at me and I looked at the one the male reporter uh Pete Alexander and I said do you ask her operation you
