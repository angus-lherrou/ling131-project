back yeah and it's because of that that\nUm he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people\nWho are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and uh\nAnd gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and almost ten years ago and to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called into the show\nI rely yeah live\nIt was just me and Robert and the whole place just the two\nOf us was a creepy yes it is great [laughter] it's\nAll a I mean just anybody who has never seen Robert The dog just go look him up you know on a just type in Robert but all Google and yeah you can see he's a creepy looking guy but from the moment I got there I was respectful\nI asked is prevention if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert ... and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert I got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably\nAnd helping to educate people that there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to this stall and if you're nice of adult then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the dog was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the ... like in the window we're running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest thing creepy his thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called\nEugene ore gene and gene\nBecame obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very successful man a ... had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with the dog\nI mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some poison was special to you and there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened\nFor gene auto he kept this\nThis a drawl a till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean\nHow little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so are his room was ... moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up and you knew that house\nWas really one new\nThere ever read see little Robert de do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next up let's go to the time or in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nFourteen years ago it was around uh August and I experience who crazy life on to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black fall some area\nMe and my friends were just hanging out up there and then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden it's super thick fog just sat and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be like jeep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right at us we've got to thinking about it\nWe're at and overlook there was no way it could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what the heck was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh then\nIt was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you learn\nThis they connected the dots I've I've been really tried to contact you but we're not trying but no one to talk to you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it what is that Josh\nWell Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville and another Tar Heel and um you know right I'm In North Carolina everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the ... mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange\nPhenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and uh you know which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear now I Believe\nThat [noise] if you if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain whites dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct a bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more grossly encounter is people seeing UFOs time flips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian on planet earth that accurate puncture is Mike compare it to the Meridian of energy that flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white are just\nMerely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you got the information coming up with a Saturday Los Angeles event at his website ... if you get there the first five

war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us\nSo Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally get started in paranormal investigator what was that one catalyst that got you into it\n[noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um\n'cause I I come from a large family uh my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything and the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photograph them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they weren't able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tells\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nI'm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no call\nAnd I'm a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe I'm David ladies involved and the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area in ... and what's even weirder is that you know they I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his watch\nYou know in the middle of a story and reading a magazine and how could he have disappeared was the abducted was the rapture the way that he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I verified the whole story with\nElderly people and historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family ah they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound\nGrow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of tried to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was well I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own to ours\nWho let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI my ... is no way to go go ahead and I was ... it was I\nWill also said yes and how does that relate to how also stay in Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day um but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas\nWe're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church has said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nYoung

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring a most of Japan uh easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread\nStories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows what else civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights\nRight absolutely terrified to when the Americans did\nInvade the civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and now you know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story\nBut now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book is that a group of tourists were at a peace museum near those cliffs and they were walking in the field near that that museum\nAnd they heard the sound of what they considered it they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a win this past them and then later heard what they described\nAs cries and screams so that was\nPretty moving for me um another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um heartbreaking and\nHe would Jima ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland to any\nHe gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these are soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan\nSo those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume mentally\nWhat's interesting to map is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of of the world war two supernatural is that the ghost don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman ship\nYeah absolutely exactly\nPeople see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is a and and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily did they hear them too\nWell some do and some don't but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise]\nUh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k.\nIt it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five I'm\nA bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm driving down the highway and they sold this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway\nSo this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway or and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and ah you know I think they described it as a a for prop I'm an engineer to look like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a a bomb or going to an air show\nOr something like that was what they do what they thought yeah you're right but to counter that\nA lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern or a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA somewhat our flight mechanics for the for the uh R. E. F. so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get from Hercules aircraft and something like a beat twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so to thousands Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least I hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time war for something right\nAnd and the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said\nThat as they were starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a naked found went overhead and then just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any stories similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI've done the handles hundreds on we're going to come back and talk more about

little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest taunted World War two soldiers spirits those planes and strange ...\nPearl Harbor is it hostage or not\nIt's extremely hearted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people towards people who were interested in history go there uh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're torn Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave\n'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor\nAnd the stories that have been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nHis watch on the USS Arizona\nEarly left his watch on the USS Arizona [noise] ah just briefly and then\nA during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked and and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona now rests\nA so that goes story has been told\nA quite a bit um [noise] excuse me there's also a story of a of all of\nOne lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces in them into the picture\nIs a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and go stories at places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to the sea cue desk which is usually inside the building\nThey say now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake\nSo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the Nazi tens or think leader and some incredible things happened to him to you died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWas that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind\nA a ...\nArchitecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall or maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents\nA general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that\nRaw will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that are between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip\nTo America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this story that uh Irwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here\nAre people who believed the story said it was a a secret\nMission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nIn what am I on on the world war two infamous people they still show up ponds\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway\nIn a in a\nLondon that once served as kind of a temporary\nNo in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two\nTo be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a\n... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of Lincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill and\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War\nTwo and disease continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the the bullet a I Believe there's the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nUh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bowl it ... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous\nAnd that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost playing flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIt back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them poof fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nMy name is Joe Thompson I'm twenty nine and thanks to my college degree I'm a systems analyst and the college me would tell you\nI wouldn't be here without big brothers big

I thought wearing costume\nOf the civil war and their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely song they were just awfully awfully worried from their expressions and\nThe smell of something that I had to get away from so I went back in and our guide hot ... and said we're have you been and I said\nI just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour\nWow a while and we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming those costumes are excellent please explain to me how they were able to get that ... that smell hideous melt and they all looked at each other and they see there isn't anyone out there\nIn each other and they see there isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these teams man\nThere is some genre of a sense with um with ah some of these things and a for instance\nThe Irwin rumble um ghost story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so there there are stories like that there are stories about people getting the uh I think in the case of the hit come a airbase\nThere's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people\nUm the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um [noise] ah articles uh after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as\nMany drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so bad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be the Seventy seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenties maybe Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um [noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nRyan in Indianapolis is with us She's still the Rockies good morning bright

with Joshua worn are very expert paranormal investigator as we talk about several things including the psycho man the him which was popularized by or different dream in ... the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing if I come at the mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later all we're going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nOn the way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nYou've got that aren't the cycle man the of it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I could figure it out and walk around and I find a room had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infinite tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite puddle of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state then if your intention is\nIs on it and you go into a meditative state then if your intention is to have a paranormal experience\nYou have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state known them\nWhen you do this properly\nAnd that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you\nBut touch you\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly welders behind properly oriented psych them anti and they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her and he pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment a you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble that's right a thing you know you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ... you you will well you know you get what you ask for right\nI just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of it and I'm not that old saying remember on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de lap in the background\nAnd maybe some white and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a lot of people ... it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on him\nThat's dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists all Ruben from Santa Barbara California with a song called winter when\nThat that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology\nGoing to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to the area fifty\n... Las Vegas\nOf Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition ABC NBC CBS Fox News media Russia China\nIn DC CBS Fox News media in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert and it turns out that that is\nOne of the most extreme UFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played\nA a a group from Ashville North Carolina the group [laughter]\nYou know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very sitting declare an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and\nThat just doesn't make sense does it Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip\nSo that was a big deal they should've been covered even more by the mainstream media but it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of apple opportunity for everybody to really get\nThe scoop uh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada Senate\nMajority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night\nThat I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force so here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and a good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications\nAnd propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nOn to say even more and this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory graphics and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified I've independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered that exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWhere could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and uh you know ... with which July twenty fifth\nAll right so that said now we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ...\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments\nDropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at knell is air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space for us\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here\nThat there is some kind of amazing technology that is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PBS or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George you think that that is all coincidence that this stuff is winding up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in the let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and want to do in this huge Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from\nIf you own a gun you have a full

this past week did not go far enough\n... did say that confirmation fight with some deep wounds in the Senate but for now calls any talk of impeaching Kavanaugh premature colonel Scott Fox news it's Columbus Day but not everyone calls it that any more\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed October ... officially Columbus Day back in Nineteen thirty seven and celebrate the man who sailed the ocean and blue and fourteen Ninety two and discovered America\nBut he didn't really discover America in fact he never even set foot in North America he's exploration was limited to the Caribbean island and that's for discovering anything well native peoples were already living there as we know\nSo dozens of cities and counties have chosen to instead celebrate Columbus Day as indigenous people day it seems just started in Berkeley in the early nineties when the city council voted to honor native people after an international plan to celebrate Columbus fell apart\nBut a few years before that South Dakota decided to rename that Native American day\nThat's Jessica Rosenthal and this is Fox News [noise]\nYou know\nNation coming to me the personal\nBoxes you know Fox News rundown the weekly

including the cycle man the him which was popularized by are different ... the originator of the term near death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight it's Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing it's like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nOn the way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of be will be with you OK\nWell ... you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nYou've got that aren't the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again when I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and say this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I find a room had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRight like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of white which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know about consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite puddle of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of the spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gave on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience George and and I want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like steak none of them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three to\nYeah it's of a full bodied tangible three dimensional seemingly ... portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is\nThat if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho mantey on they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her any pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her and so then when you go in there\nYour mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through\nNow when this becomes\nVery scary if when you have people who experiment a you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble or thing yeah you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something\nAnd when you go in there with that attitude that's a ... you you will well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kinda stuff uh yeah I think ... the odd\nThing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually you have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white and ... I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through ... him experience and I would say that a lot of people chores or is it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about 'em or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on it\nThat's dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps and some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California was a song called winter when\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery of HIV was Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO\nHot spots in the state\nWere incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way very cool that you played a a a group\nIn Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played on a a group from Ashville north\nCarolina green group\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting declare an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence\nOr are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to Europe\nAnd of course I never believed it coincidence\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be an effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does of Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip so that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media but it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop\nUh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up\nTo June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next to Harry fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announces there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and they're good one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine\nIf any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it this is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise] he's saying George\nMy own sources here in Las Vegas [noise] he's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWhere could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes and space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out\nAround the same time and uh you know ... with which July twenty fifth All right so that said now we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined\nThe mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments\nDropping a new kind of weaponry which is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at Nell us air force base\nWhich happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space for us\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that as being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might

treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was essentially moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in that house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up by new new that house\nWas re one new\nThere ever read see

welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nFourteen years ago it was around uh August and I've spirit who crazy life on to make it to make a brief [laughter] I was up a around like black Baltimore area me and my friends were just hanging out up there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the sun to all of a sudden it's super thick fog just said and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be like deep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading right are are like right at us we've got to thinking about it\nWe're at and overlook there was no way that could have been like jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what that was that\nWhat's going on on that wage\nIt was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you know we're not trying but you know willing to talk to you for about\nTwelve years now to just see what you think about it what is that Josh\nWell Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Asheville in another tar hill and um you know right in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous exam\nAnd you've talked about them before Josh yeah I've\nFamous example you've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know the which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain lead a leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear now I Believe\nThat [noise] if you I mean if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain whites dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy have as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so\nYou get more ghostly encounter is people seeing you out of time flipped scripted all that kind of stuff but [noise] and its role as form\nIt's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare to the Meridian of energy that flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and ... ... in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up with a Saturday Los Angeles event at his website if you get there the first five to ten

hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us\nSo Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally get started in paranormal investigator what was that one catalysts that got you into it\n[noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um\n'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything and the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they weren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to clogging called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nI'm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no call and I'm a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe I'm David ... involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh art these days you know the ... national park area and ... and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of a story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was the abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and what I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family ah they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact\nDoes that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was well I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two wives\nWho let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI my ... is no way to go go ahead and I was wrong it was it really will\nAlso said yes and how does that relate to how all souls they in Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day and the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween\nAnd so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day um but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas\nWe're going to be hearing more stories about this soon uh probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church has said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nThree

hard to again when we talked about it these\nThese stories tend to be more oral there between people and they don't go on line to your it's almost like I have like tens of thousands of reporters out there bringing stuff to me\nAnd I I assume the same thing is going to happen with a haunted World War two just like haunted rock and roll and in my ah a ghost stories about universities\nIt's going to Leo in Phoenix first time caller force highly oh go ahead sir\nGood evening gentlemen I\nNeeded to a question on the um most tons of data film\nI had an experience when I was visiting Gettysburg\nWe were with this group and I went to this area uh in the building where I could take care of myself and I walked out there was a hideous horrible smell it was then ... there were men who were in costume I thought wearing costumes\nOn the civil war and their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely song that they were just awfully awfully worried from the expressions and\nThe smell was this something that I had to get away from so I went back in and our guide caught me and said where have you been and I said\nI just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour\nWow well we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming those costumes are excellent so please explain to me how they were able to get that then that's now hideous smell and they all looked at each other and they see there isn't anyone out there\nOf a sense with um with ah some of these haunting sand or\nFor instance the Irwin rumble um ghost story is really focused on uh the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so there there are stories like that there are stories about people getting to\nA I think in the case of the heck I'm a airbase\nThere's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for them when the caller reminded me that uh [noise] my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um [noise]\nAh particles are after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they use to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be the seventies seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenties they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um [noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done

the sea the sharks were there it was horrible yeah\nYeah twelve hundred men went into the water to ship the ships sunken twelve minutes the twelve hundred men went in the water or know\nOut of twelve hundred men eight hundred and eighty eight eight hundred and eighty men went in the water three hundred and went down to ship five days later only three hundred and sixteen now because of new research done came out of the water a there is only\nTen survivors laugh and I'm the next July this coming July will be the last reunion here in Indianapolis because it's so hard for them to get around like you said there are night oh yeah absolutely guy and we always got to remember the greatest generation they sacrifice for us to do\nUntil but here I I was stationed in Germany are back in eight maybe one eighty three I took a day trip which some some\nFriends of mine down to back out concentration camp ha ha\nAnd you know it was more of a political prisoner camp it wasn't like a extermination camp you know like I'm the mother ones were but we were we were able to take pictures and stuff you know in and when we got scared when you as soon as you walk in the gate the pressure on you which just

than about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd will conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic party over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that the episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this poster where did we go from here\nOr by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow running to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the Flanders the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right that's a pause there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted and lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school students believable uh the smears that the the Flanders they they directed against ah against judge Kavanaugh so I can send you a bunch of slandered the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if\nAnything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact for many years to come and I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the Kavanaugh nomination with John Malcolm\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of fees contact resort released today\nAll it takes is one

com\nWell clearly he must have done the things that he was accused up because somebody who was truly get it said what would have been a ... that this would have shown that\nA fight you know paid a little angry in responding to those charges so I really think that would be good and damned if he did it the fact that twenty four hundred a walk professors or you might as well throw in former Justice John Paul Stevens a leap into this when everything else failed\nA hardly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen\nUnquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest adopted a ... that lists that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabinet or cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that to show people he was he was sincere\nI and I pocket that that's what happened I I Am\nYeah and I and I thought that that that's what happened I I absolutely\nAgree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say that you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as they used to the police compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as she did and said\nYou are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime ... also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people's service judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI I think that he he very much help his uh his claws and had he come out and been had a flat aspect or he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the his nomination\nWas talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the reduction or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this\n[noise] well I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down\nThe integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped felt in that regard because that is involved itself in more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people\nBut you know that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you have Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving stretching it called policies\nNobody was filing recusal motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage that you are hearing at the beach west court Brett Kavanaugh of who all after all only challenge the tactics of senators on the Democratic side judiciary\nA committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote or whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach Brett Kavanaugh but be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office\nAnd there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nKnown as right when we looked at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but as the the Democrats who showed up and as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crane is I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there was with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturned\nWell a step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left David predicting the demise of roe versus Wade ...\nThe on the left David ... and the demise of roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nAh starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out three people who voted to reaffirm wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court\nOr would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade decision overturned\nMy prediction if I had to had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned\nThan it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will be more likely to be upheld that's how cases that tended to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states that we have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of the whole frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the court I Know exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat a woman with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the
