something like ... to on the clock\nI'm thinking of important messages you know something on a point in your life seeing these signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nWell awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe a Bible or some religions it's the body and mind here at all\nAnd so I kinda think that what your phone is differentiating between the spirit\nOr the other person is is it's outside and the spirit inside [laughter] or either or but um I I kinda think of it on there to level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the city would you say\nThank you for your question on ... um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full dissipating and the water does that leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me of consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a world full or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or each supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain golf it's over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not die when the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talked me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain as either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted to during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day was that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through James eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how he treats people rather than material goods so it's when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given a gift to be able to do these incredible things through consciousness free cognition elected the ... and things like that\nWell yeah I I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the collapse of the study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even ... than people who aren't trained\nI think there are abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered anomalous and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book and felt so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do for\nAnd if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghosts UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was assigned to a multinational unit two thousand six in Iraq\nBut by the way thank you for serving first night where\nYour case that I was assigned to an F you every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand if he remote viewing from a section of the free intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings were able to find that three UAB and\nThe person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in a was Paul and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli defence from what I can get up who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that's consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to proceed something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind the loan has oh he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir\nI'm sure you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's er it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately with me only because of my background [noise] it would be you know personal experience I a a lot of things that I that was a I including those

to coast to coast our final segment with mark ... market can we conclude that consciousness is a part of the universe ... always was and that it survives outside of the physical\nAnd that it survives outside of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in these are I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when\nYou put together the phenomenon that we've discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like till after the psycho can he says pre cognition near death experiences children with half like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's to get that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the program\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your\nShow continue blessing thinking it was wonderful really wonderful and my ah my question is do you ever got tons of cars a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us\nAnd the so AKA consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil how this free will play a part in for a fact consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nThose free will have anything to do with a mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the ... body having free will are we talking about like the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is\nConsidering it felt to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free well does not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about tonight I think are beyond what our linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists but we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concept that our brains just limit us from understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and da da da da da da da and the ...\nI think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might have interplay with consciousness but from a missing pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he's conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose in his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in in the sentence on candy so if somebody goes into Las Vegas\nOffbeat positive uh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results were uncanny\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a shuttle James\n... Ah yes real quickly before oh make my favorite I like the a speck of this disagree with a ... that are a few is a view about the effects of a drug this Bush in the fall and the mind you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ... I'm a you know as you the person speak them into a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be a consciousness and ah the play back\nThat example would be a consciousness\nAnd ah the play back of the tape recorder a you know the type it rankles clinical those something will end up playing it just started a voice or you know distortions that would be an example of the drug mine\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus this I'm\nBringing about a distortion\nOf what consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know the wholesome of consciousness that went to is\nA but anyway uh I think the prime example of a\nA spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a example of a active consciousness uh this this thing outside of the body that um you know able to live a paid have knowledge of events that\nYou know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise I'm tell us could nieces and everything else\nI think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhen you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the medium the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased is speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to\nBring in non chance information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this ... nothing mediums are able to\nObtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think of some mediums do you think are some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nHave real abilities and the wind ...

I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers um and occasionally when I go to those fans of time and not actually use that energy\nI Would tend to ah fried a lot of my electronics\nAre from ... to forward to your book more a ghost chronicles and of course is the author of the ... which is what a great investigators he is more\nOh he's fantastic I Love just\nJust a good guy and you know I I see you met a bench all the time and I mean he's always all the pretty is just a just a nice guy\nHe is he's a nice guy and you know I met Jeff ... boy probably about\nFifteen Years ago on and he always has a nice word he always worked really hard at what he does and you know he believes in helping people so that to me makes a huge difference and it's not just you know all about me all about money it's all about how you're going to serve and help other\nWhen you're on an investigation do you go with the quick moves in a number of people\nYes yeah there is a team on over the years that team has changed and has grown and we have a you know\nFew mediums that work with us um we have people that worked specialize on the electronics they work with the ... meters on you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long\nI just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen were you what are we better get out of this thing in you know no\nNo no more than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um there's there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare\nIt's still in nursing you know I mean Ron let's say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me you know you have to just\nKeep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time has no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all the uh\nYou know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could into the air and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you choose one of the most fascinating case you been to date\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the courts and the White House um one time and there was a the last White House keeper his wife ... small I Believe what's her name and to me it was fascinating\nBecause this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't I wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer was after we would have done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channel surf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she could talk to the people around her but to me what\nReally was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lotta times it's you know ...\nCentury freight that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation um and once we did that talk you know here's this woman ... small her picture as life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt\nA connection to her that I explained\nNo to that kind of got to be emotional sometimes when you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a gravestone than you actually think you know here's a person who died and\nYou know remains or right here in New Hampshire grossly operations attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually\nYou know you you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and ... and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm as much as you probably charge\nDefinitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so if you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions money it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest thing you've come across strange ...\nStrangers case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going\nOn because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not Googling mind that information they were or\nI'm the one day he gave me a call and say hey more rain you know I have this case that's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us\nAnd our you know so yeah exactly I'm sure are on you\nKnow he's very creative right so I say\nOkay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we can go to the home it's a little ranch style house and we we get there and that's that's meant to guys there want to they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like one I think his name was most and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so was just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and then there is a shattered glass table from busted and it just looked like someone went through the house with a bat um it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know\nMy phone's been ringing with all the arrows on it and my wallet went missing and\nNow he's telling it all the things they kept saying I think that's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes I'm thinking oh my God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this is a man no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to use them\nBrings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um he leaves run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knows any rags me down on the driveway and he looks and he said I Want you to come back here tonight by yourself and I said well you know I really\nDon't feel it's a little girl and you got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is\nThere and and he

Ron is the founder and lead investigator of the New England ghost project with a degree and environmental science now he was\nA skeptic however a near death experience changed all that for him no longer blinded by his skepticism he uses scientific background now to seek the truth about the unusual in pure normal in addition to hosting ghost chronicles undergoes village radio when I tunes he holds a weekly Internet radio show on\nTargeting that dot com and also has co written books with Maureen the ones I've told told you about more ghost chronicles and ghost a day welcome Ron good to talk with you\nIt morning looking forward to this ah tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because\nI had cut my fingers are on a table saw ouch yeah uh you know and anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time so they can to wrap them up nice and kept me an emergency room so that could bring a specialist\nThey cannot wrapped them up and nice and and kept me in the emergency room until they could bring a specialist in six and a half hours later they\nPut them all back together and ah\nYou know that was fine but during the night um my doctor came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called me and for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in hospitals nobody at that time and they realized they had a flu Murray embolism\nAnd from then on things began to happen with a well this is all going on I had what I\nBelieve was a near death experience and it's not like the\nThe usual when did you hear and and that's it was I was just basically in a different place it was\nExtremely bright white I guess it's the best way to describe it and ah they were uh people their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and ah [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was\nIt sounds really ... music it had that same type thing and ah also felt a\nAnd there's a line in the Madonna song like a proud that I always quote and that is it felt like home was very comfortable it was very warm\nAnd then the whole thing just be disappeared like the closing of an iris and it was in the law that ... with us and it was just the doctor or a ICU that I was in there was no music was just my heart beat on the\nModern rooms nobody around and certainly wasn't to walk them so I when I got to the hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I got I got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that the you wasn't just the drawings that was something really unusual going on here for you\nYou know it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for these various ... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a and yet I just that the experience you know can absolutely tell you it\nWasn't no so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other uh things that I Do\nDo they re attached the fingers were they able to do yeah\nYeah well oddly enough and uh\nHow many you cut off I kept\nThe the middle one all on my left hand at the middle and totally off the the um next to it I had several places that was\nA kind of dangling the talk of the fun I head cut off completely or they actually put a ... when they put together my ah middle thing and so if I ever give anybody the finger I always tell them it's not me [noise]\nYeah 'cause it's possess ask that but that was a joke\n[laughter] three thirty in the morning it's good one soldier to the hand works normally yes it's amazing when it got yep\nIt's a ... what the time it's it's a little difficult with the cold but ah yeah it's fine\nNow tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nYeah it's a a ... for um probably about Twenty years ago\nUm when I get out of hospitals looking for something to do and\nA media one was often a course in TV production at the time 'cause my hand was on the couch and it was all kinds of blood than us and things so\nIt looked interesting it was a federal cost but I'm not up to complete it you had to do it on a a show on something and I said well I have this near death experience I don't know if it was the drugs they gave me a lot and also I own a manufacturing company in manufacturing company it was supposed to be haunted by\nPeople that weren't there and uh you know that hurts\nAll kinds of [noise] anyways I Am number so I said you know I got to do it on goes as a lock and uh\nThat's how it all started I went on my first ... TV show slash investigation and ah I realized there were a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and I'm curious I get them all I did it and eventually I\nBegan doing it fulltime and you love it I Do they still not sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you've got a degree in environmental science yeah you're\nOn the moon program as well\nAll right interesting you know you were a skeptic but now you're a believer you've made this full circle how far are you on the other side that you believe is\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that everything icy and and it's you know always skeptical bite my science\nIn and it's you know always skeptical bite my science spring I guess you want to call it a\nOr my grounding brain always you know makes me out what's going on and I've had a lot of unique experiences but to is enough there that I Know that the experiences happening but are they really paranormal already you know something else match a nation or something I just can't explain\nWhat keeps trying to you why do you keep doing this\nOh there's a lot of reasons the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand all aspects of the power of them just like going in as a you know\nWell give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that all mediums shallow things like a gypsies that the the beach do fourteen telling\nA when I met more rain I was pretty much the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do\nAnd uh so that's kinda my whoa aspects of what I Do even if I don't believe in anything\nI'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand for criticizing I got to know as much as I can about it to do that so that's kinda how I Am more open minded but still it got that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nA marine is is a very unique and and you know there are a lot of mediums out there and\nBut a wood working with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff and and our trips channel of courses stills skiffs the crap out of those people who see it so uh yeah I you know I definitely she believes she has some type of ability\nYou run across a lot of people like her in what you do business and I used to live has to\nMeet him once of mediums lots of them yeah I mean and we you know I also\nDo a lot of studies for instance the physical medium ship is it's something that's always fascinated me and and of course not for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental mania ship or a disparate speaks supposedly speaks through the\nUse them like ... ...

anything about nursing homes\nOh you see everything there\nI don't see everything but I have had a occurrence but one at one point um I work night shift\nAnd I was walking in one of the areas where there was nobody around as a chessboard and I walked in one day and the board was completely you know a reset up there was one\nOh I went up to it you know just in money and I I I find them yeah Hi\nHow are you I'm barely hearing you Matthew can you get closer to your phone\nDo you hear me now [laughter] there you go All right so um [noise]\nAnyway there's a lot of the area that they

I felt I was like I'm I'm\nFinished [laughter] ... you know this is a\nLittle like a sound like Denise ... says of course Ron have you seen objects move when you've been on a a case\nDo absolutely it of course I just told you earlier about the book that flew off the shelf yeah but it's hardly he says that there's a famous case of a a Boston sports writer who was friends with a wrestler by the name of ... who was the angel French angel or something like that\nAnd uh used to play chess on all the time and eventually this this wrestling died and he had a a a death vast made or or or a buster is his head\nAnd he bought one of those like trying to chess game which is so he's he like just continue playing but then he realized one day the chess thing was never applied then\nUh he actually called it a couple of people from the the at the University of ... in Boston and they couldn't explain that they moved to the bus the ... and everything and ah we continue to make these moves even though it wasn't\nA plugged in and he swears that he believes that was his friend the fringe angel ... still playing chess with them in the afterlife\nHow many of these events in a entities are mischief makers as opposed to trying to hurt somebody\nI think it's it's overblown as far as trying to hurt somebody um I mean marine in line so I have gone and I'm On a nexus systems with the Catholic Church where we're talking demons versus a um you know spirit\nYes there are some\n... there were a nasty and uh to be quite honest with you or having a trance channeling channel that sometimes like Maureen can be a little\nA nerve wracking because uh there was some versus actually don't like me and when you give them a body they for\nYou know they they use it sometimes she's thrown at her restaurant on she still only across the room before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so early in the air it can be nasty but I I think the the most of them are really not\n... not you've written about Ron having your back what does that mean exactly\nYou know I haven't made that we've worked together for so many years on and then the beginning you know if I started to transfer channel you know he would try to call me back meaning the way you know whether you're waking someone offer him army and what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that written on on where I Would talk to Iran and say you know in my mind I Know what I might appear to be out of control but in my mind I'm actually you know talking to the spirit or trying to you know can\nConnect more or get into more of what they're wanting and what's going on so now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out to help me in a situation that's not safe and he's right there so that's having my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't kind of touched me going yeah I mean to allow me that space\nAnd make sure people don't kind of touched me and go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to do\nLet's go to urban in a state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing do love your show um along because as a I live in a house gets to hundred and five years old\nAnd my age I have had so many haunted experiences that house it's crazy it's actually kind of funny rarely 'cause I I ah really only have a nice place to hold the guy's activity when I I'm trying to fix the house\nIf I like Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I've been doing some doors that majority in the house and I come home and uh the\nThere was a ... or ... three feet away from my stove that have been ripped off and driven down through my laptop though it was like if you're not part of their genes\nOr when I go I go into my bedroom and it would take him to one of my TV ... and you don't like what kind of kind of set up in front of the house yeah it does take in that setting off on my bed\nAnd uh\nI think I have my wife and my kids have actually seen a kid and a lady I I actually had never seen that goes but I heard um I've heard like the footsteps I'd read slamming doors\nSo you're pretty convinced that are there oh\nThere is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh I guess my question is is\nWhy why when my son to do something to fix the house is that when they seem to do that\nWhile only they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nYou are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best I mean it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually stretch things up\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do some are fun some are having a good time other evil what decides whether they're good or bad Ron in terms of that\nI think it's it's who you are right and this this life and if you don't change you're pretty much\nWho you are on the next life so if you have to deal with the court accordingly of there were some times\nWhen I um and don't speak nicely to of as as some people who like in ... but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if they're ah that'd be any annoying or being a\nOffensive to to those who are running this realm no it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respectable\nScore to Giovanni in Los Angeles alone

time to time\nOne of the places like security with our cat was a um a building called the malls they're building in here in downtown LA it's pretty old building it's one of those buildings that kind of\nHave stood the test of time beautiful architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's so definitely haunted I Know I I Am one night especially I was I was working we have these monitors that have cameras set up off the route every floor building and there's several floors doesn't before um\nAnd the monitors are set up to the motion sensor that so that every time somebody comes in or out on the cleaning lady or something like that the monitors will switch on and I\nHave you ever caught one on tape you know what I mean shadows I've totally shatters I've seen and it always happens around the corner of your eyes how's this quick ...\nYeah they do just like that but that would be great if you could get that caught on video\nFor life but how often I think you're probably going to let her get out their spouses or credit card\nHow can you get more credit card users you know I may say your\nThem my ... year free\n[noise]\n\n\nWe are back what's wrong the collection Maureen would our final segment here funnel calls more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere a Amazon and uh\nAll the major bookstores so\nI was only not Maureen that our dear friend

was the largest site on the schools village so that's a since then we've become really good friends\nThis technology continue to make ... hunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better quicker there's ... there's a lot of\nUm things out there some of them are really junk science but a\nA R I don't know I mean spirited around for you know hundreds and hundreds of years\nAnd ah they didn't have a water technical stuff back then yet people still had experiences though had great experiences and seeing them and everything else I don't know we need a ... you know it reminds me of you know all the physical meaning ship stuff the lead you boards\nAnd those were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people wanted to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic devices doing there\nThere are trying to get the goes tempted to deal directly with her and not have to go to a meeting or not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but it's yeah I mean there are there are some\nUm\nBetter pieces of equipment up there and there are some that are of course but uh you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good uh I I Can't remember a a good record\nAnd marine how 'bout you will technology you change things\nYou know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human being you know and then what we can censor ourselves on and we may be getting close with some areas that they're they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigated anytime\nSharon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nAll right let's go to a final calls here let's go to Z Hastings, Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there resent hurricane headed your way\nWe're on the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one\nOkay let's spray that everybody else is going to do yeah I had a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight\nYears ago in Florida we were at a a paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in plain Oregon State which is known to be haunted and while we were there ghost\nA this was in the middle of the night it goes to actually made it table moved slightly up on the second floor\nSo we went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the guest wife Susan and I and some other people that were there and we [noise] we any um any man flashlight on a table and the ghost could answer our questions by making the light ranked\nAnd so we're asking various questions and to get it to indicate that its name was Murray and then it was or was it had been a nurse said at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period\nIn August and up at the time I had a um I had a briefcase with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so the time\nI Would hear clicking noises that goes for teasing me that he was opening a briefcase\nOn London now while I'm gone for the oil would happen is um if I drop like a little I don't care for profit shares something I'm less latest about I'm not last July but the one before that\nThe middle of the night well having a little tiny vial campers something fell off the side of the chair and it's fun and like a high percentage speed down for\nWhy are they mischief makers wrong what what are they trying to accomplish my playing around\nSometimes they're they're just attention seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am here to pay attention to it\nSeen or heard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and and do silly things to what you know there there have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut ah I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I elected to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said here take it back she says we were reading the uh the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shattering bucks who's doing the same thing to do\nAnything really what they want to do I believe\n... each Tom what do you have a swimming from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to run more and more green can recommend ways to prevent ... from coming to a person's life ... into someone's life much give that to you more you can\nCall so I don't even have it to the wrong one\n[laughter] we'll get on main really ...\nYou had kids I'm honestly I'm a big believer with the with St Michael so I Know for me there's a few things one is intention if you know you're looking for that and you're believing that evils coming into your life and you know it's very possible that your credit invited in\nOn the other thing is I for instance I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up the actually she thinks there it's already um so what we're doing is we had a St Michael's prayer that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have different varying crystals\nAround the room for how ... when the energy on and\nHe's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's a belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you have to believe in yourself\nAs well on you can tend to have bought out bought out most times\nWhat'd you say you were on what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurricane and your intention sure\nMake it yeah so and tensions is a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion of course and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two down to one in you know who's the sea prayer is\nThe cause but hey you know what your word works\nYep crank Korea hundred percent with the judge\nSnake in any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead\nI'm Sorry to say first that uh I think we should all get centered in our heart and then ten to dissolve the third yeah I agree [noise] my my question is probably more ring\nI have been serving\nThe land for the last six years here I feel it's time for me to go back to serving man\nOf attempted to move in April when I had a series of events that showed me it was a time yet for my question is would it be tough for me now to to live on [noise]\nDid you do a quick little reading here Maureen sure any one moment okay\nWell you probably know that I Would check when you were on on this what's what are your next project Ron How often do you get cold to investigate\nWell we had quite a few uh you know I Would say you like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now and uh we only choose to once we really want to do basically uh uh\nDo you get flooded with requests ...\nWe do get a lot of 'em be honest with you judge so uh yeah it ... you've got a screen 'em somehow so which is difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\nAll right so bell actually public ... couple of cards and one was aspiration paying you know to to go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual card that says you know you need to be empowered you this\nUm and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment is right to actually make a change and it seems like it then working behind me off I have tried the night I'm working really hard and it's time to kind of read some of those benefits\nAnd actually to move forward um obviously I Can't tell you what to do but I think that if you were to make a change now would be good looking at the time\nI really appreciate the\nOkay good luck bill over everything

technology group in Silicon valley a former investment banker with UPS in New York He's world view who's been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country to mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain\nYou know after a short June extensively he wrote this book an end to upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and your use on coast to coast I've got this really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and\nPeople who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists June the medical professional folks mark\nWould always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did you\n[noise] I did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago filling the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're at you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chant says that would happen and DNA leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that's the perspective\nAnd if you buy into that which I used to and then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone\nThan when you think about meaning in life\nIf you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned and narrow science and most of science today you\nKnow looking at your bio I Would lose money in a back saying that you would write a book about consciousness showing the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was about\nTwo years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally a material is that is what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a calf that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities ... for consciousness to survive bottle he got things I had no familiarity with\nAnd over time just hearing enough different people describing similar perspective unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless and here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that processes consciousness and the identity that we have is not\nTied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of\nIntense research because I Need to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting and as I was ...\nBut in my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends over time at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had in tents passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days\nAnd ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a whole email bill Gladstone who's now my agent and my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart total a\nGood meal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness\nWhat I now see to be the more likely picture of reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight with out the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talked about near death experiences and\nIf you'd asked me a few years ago wasn't near death experience I Would have said well isn't that just a host nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in a near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that it suggests develop some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website marked rule bird dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking

wrote this book did it surprise some\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yeah they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people that the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell us a cycle couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior\nOr be research didn't you\nAbsolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncovered and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating to look and she came when she came out with so much sounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's it's mine too my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I examine each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like the left or the and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo left to the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should\nSay that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combined the results\nThe statistics are very compelling and Dr dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you've got to stick stigma result the odds that the that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we'd have six sigma results\nSo the ... experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experiment there's an experimenter said Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent right\nNow we're ... the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our commonsense everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nSure instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they text you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is with the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a have had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later\nTend to go into a trance like state and people who are better meditate hers seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things you can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender\nHaving much to do with it I I I think that the receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room\nAnd simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw at the U.S government uh but if it's an every day\nOn pets and that's what we saw with the U.S government uh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and used psychic spies for national security purposes many of them have been on the show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many remote viewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal if consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments\nUm say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [noise]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that and my business world if I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me\nAt least made me question things um even further than that there's a page on science panel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these tell a path to studies\nAnd I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used a ... I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them you know a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it as something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiments where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a creek talking dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre

upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after searching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking they introduce all a bus to these cutting edge ideas and your use on goes to goes I've got this really shocked you wouldn't usually marked goodness\nAbsolutely shocked me and thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDodge consciousness exist outside of the brain or not know the pure scientists June the medical professional folks more\nWould always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought no there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did\nI did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the materialist science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made of matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago filling the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this big universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance says that would happen and DNA it leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that the perspective and if you buy into that which I used to then when the brain dies\nConsciousness dies memories are gone than\nWhen you think about meaning in life if you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one of the dead there is no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in narrow science and most of science today\nNo would you know your bio I Would lose money in a back saying that you would write a book about consciousness how the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter]\nSo it was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally a materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across a cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers and I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to a different episodes and people there are many different people have talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities\nThe ability for consciousness to survive bottle that things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out [laughter] and uh changed my world you completely led me down the path of\nIntense research because I Need to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight\nSo after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened so it was July\nIt's on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened so it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco\nAnd decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than half of the book that's now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a cold email don't Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nAmong people Neal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we ended up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary\nExisting yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight without the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests\nNo would science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talk about near death experiences\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just to hold his nation that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness it's not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they've ... out of body experience so the person is out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that is suggestive of some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark ... bird dot com is linked up for you at ... dot com the name of his book we're talking about\nAnd into upside down thinking me or read the subtitle dispel the myth that the

Health News dot com ... ... is is with us right now as we talk about his work in into upside down thinking\nMark ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nA great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people that the evidence but I was referring to people parked out and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell us a psycho couldn't he says you you of course we learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics on science fiction I had no idea there was actual science they controlled study that hadn't been done on the topic and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about telepathy what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt that way who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she\nHer entire career to investigating to look at me and she came she came out with so much sounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's it's mine too mine communication and just taking a quick step back\nThe reason that I exam each of these phenomenon is that I reason that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective cannot account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I reason that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well up to the to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns felt experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should\nSay that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experiments hers and when you combined the results the statistics\nAre very compelling mhm doctor dean rating\nWho just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds of that the effect has just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the gun thought experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane has given a picture by the experiment there's an experimenter said Jane I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room so jaded mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent range\nAnd I'm Wondering how the law probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect as twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through and it actually conforms to our commonsense everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nSure is that it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they text you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two of her she's twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase at ... at the center or the receiver\n\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a has had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender\nHaving much to do with it I I I think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... ethic or communications with the deceased\nThrough mediums ... these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room and simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just have to tell you what they think\nShe said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with the U.S government\nUh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult studies to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and you're used psychic spies for national security purposes many of marine I've\nBeen on the show right away\nHe says many of marine I've been on the show right away\nYeah during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was won by remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local than it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently [noise]\nSo I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me\nAt least made me question things um even further than that there's a page on a science and all and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science handles report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these tell a path to good studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they say no which stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used a ... I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre technician known as ... sentiment where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream now is eight creek pocket dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it that much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\nTiny time there isn't a house that we estimate that family has a family and then

payments you should know the credit card companies are tricking you into thinking there's no way out\nCredit card companies would rather you didn't know that there are ways you can become debt free and you don't have to pay the entire amount you oh\nThere are debt relief programs that help people like you escape overwhelming credit card debt\nBirth marks or physical deformities\nThat are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say exactly\nSo it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another offensively\nWe have Monique in someone tele horn you're with us I'm Monique go ahead\nGeorge and why I have a question for your gas sure how hey thank you for a ban on the show so I'm back in two thousand and one I fear and I told comment was set on that is actually six mental tell a path experiences with in one week\nOh I had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian and and now\nThere was no one around no I'm for now animals I was by myself\nAnd I guess I'm I like to know people that are tell a path that now you have that people are are usually good with meditation I haven't gone to let them at meditation my life but I have been on my own a\nTremendous amount of time I'm at\nA deep thinker I'm spiritual\nAnd I think I'm an empathetic [laughter] so I wanted to know if the qualities allow people to be more ... path that in addition for about twenty two years ... triple digit I'm On the clock on the email address is\nDid you get 'em on the clock on the email address is ... played them what not and this has become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um I\nKind of thinking that this light the palate tactic experience as well saying something like ... to on the clock I'm thinking important message it you know something unimportant in your life seeing signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing um\nWho will awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe in Bible or some religions it's the body and mind here at all\nAnd so I kinda think that what your home is differentiating the tone [laughter] to stare at\n... or the other person is it's outside and the spirit inside or either or but um I I kinda think of it on there to level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the city what are you saying\nIt thank you for your question on the um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a whirlpool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we're fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state and so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a world full or otherwise in the street\n[noise] do you think that consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or each supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off it's over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not die when the body dies because consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talk to me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often record is known as a life review\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is one of their brain is either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected\nSo let's say Bob harm to change in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through James eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods so it's when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given the gift to be able to do these incredible things from consciousness free cognition fill up with the ... and things like that well\nYeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's the subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book and salt so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in\nAll right I'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was sad when multinational unit two thousand six in Iraq\nBut by the way thank you for serving first night where\nYou have that I was assigned to an F you every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand if he remote viewing from a section of the esprit intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings\nWere able to find that very UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in\nA was ball and I believe he was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli defence from what I can get up who I dealt with over there\nMhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in the remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to proceed something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our he's outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their ... and they accept water that's outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir I'm\nSure you do or ... you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it ... me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things

survives outside of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically\nAll agree on that\nI mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when\nYou put together the phenomenon that we've discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like till after the psycho can he says pre cognition near death experiences children with half life memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt gets that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the program\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your\nShow continue blessing thanks wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my question is do you ever got tons of cars a reincarnation as a result\nOf consciousness living outside the body in each of us and the so AKA consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil how this free will play a part in for a fact consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nFree will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the ... body having free well are we talking about like the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infinite free well but at the level of perhaps ... an individual that is\nConsidering it felt to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free well does not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about tonight I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists but we can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concept that our brains just limited after my understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to deal with this how to use it a Andy Andy use it\nI think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt that the ability\nOf the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose\nAnd his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in in the Senate John Candy so somebody goes in the Las Vegas offbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results were uncanny\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a similar James\n... Ah yes real quickly before oh make my favorite I like the uh respect of this disagree with a ... that are a few of a view about the effects of a drug this Bush and the on the mind you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ... I'm a you know as you the person speaking to a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be a consciousness\nAnd uh the play back of the tape recorder a you know the the the wrinkles clinical though something will end up playing it just started a board or you know distortion that would\nIt started a voice or you know distortions that would be an example of the drugs mine you know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus this I'm bringing about a distortion\nOf with consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in his shoe clarity that's you know the wholesome of consciousness that went to\nA but anyway uh I think the prime example of a a spirit living outside of the body is death to self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a the example of an active consciousness of this ... this thing outside of the body that\nUm you know able to levitate have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise a telescope nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhen you think of them are\nWell there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the ... Research Center\nAnd these studies are used five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased is speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to\nBring in non chant information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this they just think that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of someone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think of some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are fraud out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nHave real abilities and the ...

you know I over the years um I've\nYou know you're like addicted to it\nMm no not addicted to it but to me when I'm\nYou know investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing at 'em and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right I'm like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers um and occasionally when I Would go through those fans of time and not actually use that energy\nI Would tend to uh fly a lot of my electronics\nAre from ... to forward to your book more a ghost chronicles of course is the author of the ... which is what a great investigators do you use for\nOh he's fantastic I Love just\nJust a good guy you know I Wish she met a bench all the time as always will be pretty is just a just a nice guy\nHe is he's a nice guy and you know I met Jeff ... boy probably about Fifteen Years ago\nUm and

about money it's all about how you're going to serve and help other\nWhen you run an investigation goal was quick to the number of people\nYes yeah there is a team I'm over the years that team has changed and has grown and we have a you know\nFew mediums that work with us um we have people that worked specialize on the electronics they work with the M. F. meters on you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long\nAnd just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen were you what are we better get out of this thing you know no\nNobody knows more than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um there's there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare it's still a nerve and you know I mean one let's say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me\nYou know you have to just keep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time has no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all this uh\nYou know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you choose the most fascinating case you been to date\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last White House\nUm one time and there was a the last\nWhite House keepers wife Connie small I Believe what's her name and to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't I wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was after we were done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channeled turf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she could talk to the people around her but to me what\nReally was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times it's you know ...\nCentury afraid that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation um and once we did that talk you know here's this woman ... small her picture as life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I\nCan explain noted that's got to got to be emotional sometimes\nWhen you see things like that and I do when you were in the ... you know you look at the Greeks did you actually think you know here's a person who died\nAnd you know ... or right here in this new show on a ... to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nAh you know I've broken down a while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually you know you you talk about\nThe loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and that's ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm as much as you probably try to crush the focused you know you get involved and\nYou do definitely do you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it's ...\n... you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions money it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say the strains used to shoot come across a strange\nStrange is case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times can just hear\nAbout all the time he would never tell me where we were going on because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not Googling my information was I'm so\nOne day he gave me a call and say hey Maureen you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us in our\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm Shirley run\nYou know he's very creative right so I said\nOh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we'd go to the homeless this little ranch style house and\nWe we get there and as the men
