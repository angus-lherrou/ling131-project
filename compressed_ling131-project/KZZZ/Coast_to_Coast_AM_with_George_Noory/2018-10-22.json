this segment of the big world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why\nWell one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kinda over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nYeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man\nThat has a lot of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it\nBut a lot of people just to Pruitt sale you know was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they ... and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just phony get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big one sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio and Pennsylvania to be so prominent in the numbers and it's because I mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties\nWhere the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived at the time\nOh exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings well that's Bruce faculty with Ohio he's a friend and I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio\nIn the air and on the ground it's really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac it'd be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big blood or sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of them either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day fighting's\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um\nYou know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like big foot I mean that's kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's the similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I I wouldn't have to live through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe ... maybe read they really were liberally wild men out there\nWell then usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening that happens too often for people to be fabricating it I\nI hear it occasionally but not very often\nI hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days are ... like a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's a famous stories out of Arizona and New Mexico and the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they\nPut people start their head start spinning that fact\nWe're there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and\nCoast time and space to the point where they saw Bigfoot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds and when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hards don't like it\nThe UFO diehards uh like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are in the wake you up those are where\nThey're from but um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can ignore it I I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who said they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual several years ago one\nOf my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that they may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them in this all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the same man\nTold him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me\nTurn around get back on the horse or get back on my ... a TV and leave and he does\nThen the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property helicopter so dogs\n[laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing because I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and\nDifferent kinds of groups um do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen\nThem take deer et cetera they're an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up on a tree and I could two hundred and fifty pound here a native I couldn't have done it and\nThey're um thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome that could have all David I have had many sleepless night listening who everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time\nSo good job on your finding um I Want him to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying it how it's related wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or off though of the way that we could find out more about wild man because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour ideas revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because of their own and my question is you know like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nLike you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually from a PHD level people the thought that drones are going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people a housing work real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the law and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call it a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here [noise]\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there for something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAh actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there and there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you could hear it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it in October garbage cans you head alarms going off and the police officers tasted\nA I think they've they've found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we describe on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen\nWhat looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floated just off the off the ground in the middle homes that they are on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through the skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the uh at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike a head with no neck on a on a body is just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it\nAnd they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but are there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um I've seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it didn't proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah Hi Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right on your mind\nSo [noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... you talked to came on his saddle um he thought big foot\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... ... and ... and ... the prophet and he ... he ran in the ... and uh he described Cain as the\nAs a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah just to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm I'm there\nI'm personally wonder here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought in mourning culture LVS coach really that we have you know there's two story really famous that story than just to leave this too is Joseph Smith nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and the the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple\nAnd I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priesthood to cast came out and so he loves his hand and they just crashed a cat yeah and came roaring\nLike hey they're kind of hush hush let's not talk about it but as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I was just wondering for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading his book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot he said he keeps he does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you Kyle and everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are ... social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely the go to person in their own circles more information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type encounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was with natural ... but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nNow Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's\nCompelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mine spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to\nTo establish any current pattern that points to one suspect when you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact the equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA but\nAgain if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow [laughter] and I should\nPoint out that you know you did address this may be crowded and hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for regarding people as far as you\nWell know killing them I I think I'm going okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit I followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came up came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person\nThere was a forest on ring a bell yeah\nAh so well but there's this story\nOut of Wyoming that I I don't put much credence in it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal\nBut a group disappeared Wyoming and to uh people who were poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm that appear

July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across those needs to be from Guam for the Philippines and almost straight west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or the middle of the Philippines the on July thirty is Nineteen forty five ... minutes after midnight or she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called ice if the aid and ended by lieutenant commander most you Sarah how she mode of\nHow she might have fired six pols torpedoes it Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely lose a foul off the ship Indianapolis is heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very quick about three hundred men went down with the shift of\nA little under nine hundred made it into the water allies and when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've fought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story a that most people know about Indianapolis\nShe was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days and the water and only three hundred and sixteen and survive\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and if you do you just sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr what did you share with the how secrecy which obviously was necessary military necessity a lead to tragedy and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to get at the core story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that held secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there\nWas a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that Indianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indiana Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants ship the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive you only tennis thought well I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then beyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines see\nReporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes have been broken and we were using that\nAnd so you know he should not have been there without an escort he should have had you know taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns\nAnd so she should've had something you know first of all that sonar and second of all that had\nAny harm or ability armored too yeah and um or I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruisers so her armor was exceptionally sin compared to many of the newer shifts\nFor armor was exceptionally thin compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reason why she thinks so quickly\nUh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy of the mission and why she was out there and why this information was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions\nKnowing that there was a direct threat and it's ...\nTold me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of it they mention is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families\nTalking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know at the screenplay and eventually the book and limit as well when she came in we had this trust built in\nWith the men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the accurate story however hard and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell was it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters you you get to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're meeting them together I guess from people who didn't know there but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nTry one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back the land on the Indianapolis story because really the man uh before I get passionate is just to to you know circle back and the man who ferry\nThe atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis when an army named Robert and I'm major named Robert for men\nAnd who has spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb uh on the continent of Europe\nThough one madness in with him and then burn and carry components of little boy attending an island\nUm that is the final grading yet or every year and and if the conflict and so in writing the whole book we try to pull back that men can bring in a lot of other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hash amount overhead and for the call and tell me ... ...\nAnd what we tried to do or where you have to recognize it even though men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing well\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men are passionate of point of view and there was attacked around it voted in Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger or in the end of World War two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot ... cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology I'm guessing that marine and\nReally against protocol at the time because definitely had a very autocratic Afghan military\nAnd he went around saying on doors at ... radar and more technology for his that marine because that makes them or you didn't have radar right up until the end of the war\nAnd so he was very frustrated because he was in a lot of his brothers that commanders\nGo down to the grave or lack of technology they're carrying had why he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm book which was on\nUm we were also able in interviews granddaughter a and yet even more information about his later life half before\nAs we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean the took the extraordinary step of having him testify at a court martial for captain McVeigh and then uh they didn't really want to hear his voice\nCourt martial for captain McVeigh and then they didn't really want to hear his version of of how things went well we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to uh the moments right after these torpedoes lamb into decided the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um you know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal\nAre not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yeah\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for ... clouds just part of the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck\nGetting the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations they had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship\nSo with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt first to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to his state from their compartments and yeah Lynn had mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way and tell you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe and you know those who went down on and went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raff that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side ports side well the majority of the men went off that died and there was no supplies so they weren't in raft they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who could help them you know fellow ship made or whomever\nAnd others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead Taylor and put it on them\nI mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year old that had just gotten on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there and just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nLieutenant a red van actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very thick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer\nI'm you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel\nSo no one's really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a shift in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd and there was it then you know there were attempts to get to go out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExact uh um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that they know what's coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit uh ... in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you described from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nWell that's right um there were\nAnd as well\nWell that's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe currents they move that about one mile an hour in that area and they also moving these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve foot swelled some days it's it's clear as glass says on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve swells along with these current so over time over the course of the the five nights and four days\nAnd then become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm One of the rescue pilot later wrote\nThat from altitude\nA rescue plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism access cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water the the the as Sarah mentioned the the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd kept in park within that group and he really than\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep the men together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets\nWas a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they formed that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and captain park would uh\nHelp them then that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times and he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations\nAnd and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all got to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nSome men are even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place\nI'm worse there was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and there was hoarding 'em up supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as I'm\nHearing the story even without the injuries and the terrible burned in the back they have no water supplies are out there in exposed elements for days they they have no water and after\nThis is Louise recently she got help going on line okay so it the

Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain bill Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help things on race this man\nI tell the story of a book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a to prove the survivors and kept the McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because\nYou know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from the family you didn't feel he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this might be sixty event and how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion and the ships namesake city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it that when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receding lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just they would be playing right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nAnd when captain they they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the crap and and ... came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receiving end so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSure it's talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records are here with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past and and if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act should've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contacts\nAnd then you know we contacted the the source again and our contacts said well we don't have an unrestricted version doesn't exist and so\nInterestingly enough you know a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and said fifty three men his\nHis grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I was trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really\nTestimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because in the court marshal they\nDid not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed and so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship saying but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the lights mediate Lee after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken I I Would do more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves that that for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to pay hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were actually participated in a parade\nAnd then a very quickly they went home uh\nCaught buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them and maybe they got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families and they held it in three years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in jaws you know you got that story bottled up he becomes a sharp country as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nJust removing seen those great I was going to use the clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage him in the book or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book\nYou know one of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from jobs so it's an essential part of the stories history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home several accounts\nCame home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this scene and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\n[noise]\nSarah share with me your thoughts or would you heard the news I think it was last year that the uh Indianapolis had been found a it is a mission ... by Paul Allen\n[noise] actually it was about four in the morning when I was\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis and you know bill was contacted by the navy and\nHe called me and Sarah they found the ship\nI didn't know what he was talking about it\nFor them [laughter] and so you know dating my faculty and\nYou realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the petrol group which was the vessel that were ... responsible for finding the ship ... there's been several attempts and they were the first ones to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their shift had been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime or what [laughter]\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money stuck\nOn winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we heard a little bit about road blocks went up to the information they were they were not entirely helpful and every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book Simpson come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny Fifteen or twenty sixteen and we said well through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and and give the entire history\nAnd draw a new analysis that various things that happen in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nOf boy we're really nervous about that but he really really has endorsed the story and I went to his full court since he saw which is what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm hopeful big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned okay\nWe'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions about the west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California as a personal connection to the story I jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... or to rescue Shavers and water and I'm Still have one ... and ... you know\nAnd I never saw him I ... years past ... years go by never saw him cry ... talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with key on the U.S has a piece of tape do el or that that that you know the name of the ship that the man\nWho ... and I don't remember it's on its orange been stone and I was thinking about you for calling I thought yeah what was the name of the ship but to me she was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talking to your roots horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about\nEgypt all that all those years you know he\nWas like a you know just it was just part of the ethos of that generation that says\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea uh he was a gun urging donors may first class you know he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years ago there was an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic could go into harm's way like that\nIn first class you know that he got out he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years ago there was an incredible story\n... ... to go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset\nOne interesting story is that they can ending officer of the ... that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same he didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he needed at that had been found probably by that marine but they didn't know what exactly had happened and there was um\nA sailor spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and the cat in ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad this had been on that shit\nThanks Jerry appreciate it wildcard line run and used in the morning on good\nMorning ah my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de oil he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up\nOne of his ah I guess she just you know of all of his memory loss and I found unbelievable and eye witness account a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got the letter in front of me it's dated August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pool these guys up tick in the sharks author rear end\nShowing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given them penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the of view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this but the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole of count its its history its historical\nI Love my ... a share this with a young ladies if I can get them getting information and now\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna O R R gal there will get the information for you will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah\nThere's fourteen still living\nI don't assume that they still have a gathering do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're

keeping it inside I don't know if it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe it wasn't a more healthier I I don't know I think

Native American chief got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell when it happens and\nHarvey and I've done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd a kind of how it started\nA you say you don't have a dog in the white meaning you're not committed to one edition or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge outta hat hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the sack Lee ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribal people he's on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least and coexistence right\n[noise] yeah it in the tribal area and met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nOr and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo we think about the ... areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through Hooper from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains than I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and ... over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know\nShe can you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man former law man at the state of the evidence about this whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring it on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were there were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this Melbourne worked through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the fight that went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to uh Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this is when it was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explain to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this [noise] she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of that and\nUnfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to or certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results [noise] ah it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that ... what did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her that people are going to say well how do you know that's ... year well\nThat ain't going to say well how do you know that's a big for their well\nBig foot hair looks different than any other mammal here in the world and I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if they didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Mel but did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta different what attitude in this arena as you know George\nAnd it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like to UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes the cake their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage and others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of human rights and they'd say well as human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with human match on gender thing\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kinda surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot with trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it and they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report\nIt's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figured this out um it's unfortunate\nYeah then it got kind of thrown under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or did they talk it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight how did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to make that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man\nWe're worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description\nTwenty four used eighth gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but again\nIt wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations is genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like big foot there's a appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up on that but he doesn't say anything he goes you know what this map of because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated the same location since the ...\n[laughter] and but it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries in mountains\nAnd in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the my age and showing the legend stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate where all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book is from the Maryland get that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three\nDescribing an account or a witness to use this on the ... number rubber an animal between twelve and ... ... feet by its shape resembling a human head was ... which is an equal proportions the body the seats are two feet long and Harry\nUh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions a big way\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds and I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said in equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nNobody nowadays is ever brought this stuff up\nSo one of the articles I put in the tribal big foot book that nobody wants to talk about was in

than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story\nI was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is when Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book\nA but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works I'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you\nKnow the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the ... project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAs it turns out of course similar sightings have been reported all over the world and wild Dave is better known these days for his investigations of missing people\nAnd I coordinate down the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey you can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten\nIt got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe a one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that live miles away who saw one coming into town\nI started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something to a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just quick like brothers\nAnd with Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey drew the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept and\nHarvey and I have done this for a long time now together and ah we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nA you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most vocal the most audacious\nThe most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push back cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around hoop and drew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey wife Gina proud also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge out I had hair all over the body but there was this human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that\nEight characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady and to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the old there's they would consistently say this is another tribal people is on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with them at least and coexistence right\nYeah ... ... in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see I'm\nThe only thing that the hoop areas the trinity river I great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big ... over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something\nAbout that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but can you summarize as a law man former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's the mission evidence that something is real here are we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it in many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted\nA many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the wife had went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the Arab region to uh Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bag and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written by before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this she listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you kept strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nWith a scientist who reads that science behind the paper they know that\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\n[noise] well that's the part that I I don't think a lot of people understand it a wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results uh was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that belt but did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her that people are going to say well how do you know that's a big for their well pick for heroin looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America and when you look at a big ...\nAnybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America and when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if they didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the ... and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta different what attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very turf conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes the cake their passion to different levels um to the point of\nFraudulent um material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with human match on gender thing\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when it broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online\nAnd see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out um it's unfortunate\nYeah then it got down to Rona under the under the bus as she did as well um you you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight oh did you how did you find all these\nSo ... ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded is two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas\nAnd Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article in the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nOne of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know a few overlay this map with the maps of big foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot there's a appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes out like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this Napa because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how they're kind of associated in the same locations as the big ...\n[laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations that really kind of got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... and showing the legends and stories about the big bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and uh yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate where all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn ... June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three\nDescribing an account or a witness sees this on his own work number rubber an animal between twelve and ... ... feet high it's a sheet resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportions the body\nThe seats are two feet long and Harry uh that sounds like our guide and I mean the description so Mike modern descriptions of big ...\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds and I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said in equal proportion to the body\nAnd so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\n[noise] ...

we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's Bruce ... with Ohio he's a friend and I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year and the strange things that he's\nTold me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWell I'd I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then end up ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about the present day fighting's\nAgain from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and uh I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like they could somehow it's kinda strange\nIt was inspired by maybe yeah I don't\nKnow it's it's it's a similarity um some of the descriptions I I wouldn't have to leave the right here to find one but it\nSeems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe ... maybe read they really were literally wild men out there\nAnd usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing\nAnd kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but\nYou know maybe it's some association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but\nHappens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days are ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona and New Mexico and the high plains out there were a they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spinning that fact\nBig for people start their head start spinning that fact we're there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kinds of tribe and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people to die hard don't like it\nThe UFO diehards like it even less they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are and all the way you out those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge dairy farm and he went out there and talk to them and this oh I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then\nThe same man told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't\nTurn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a pocket way out in the corner of the property a helicopter so on\nDogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of these dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruits\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer terror there an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the\nMiddle of the woods hunting themselves they'll come across a deer that stuck up on a tree and I could two hundred and fifty pounds here a native I couldn't have done it and\nThey're um thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome second of all David I have had many sleepless nights listening who everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time [laughter]\nSo good on your finding um I Want him to talk about this thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying that how it's related wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or also as a way that we could find out more about wild man because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour ideas revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer if he has his own and my question is do you feel like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people uh hasn't worked real well and you can't use a drone in a national park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call it a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers\nFor the people here your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAh actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dogs mated noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you can hear it it I mean it was just taking these giant strides it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off and that the police officers chased that\nUh I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin marker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homesteaded there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through the skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the uh at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm speaker list dark humanoid shaped\nLike a head with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it\nAnd they can tell you they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but ah there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um I've seen it all over the you went to Beijing so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomena and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph feelings that the one who talked the Cain on his saddle um he thought they put\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five star Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... ... and he was ... the prophet and he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as the\nAs a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah just to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man I'm personally wander here and there and I might go will visually he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought the Mormon culture LVS ... that we have you know there's two story at a really famous that story than just to leave this too is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter Wesley Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple\nAnd I'm In his hand [noise] uh\nUh Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and some of the rolls his hand and they just crashed a cat yeah king [noise] and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the different churches because I've been reading his book for a little while and stuff\nI Do take it it's a big foot you taking like does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know and like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a ... everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo ...\nAnd what's going on is like people are asking me you know and like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you Kyle and everyone listening here did tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are certain social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely the go to person in their own circles more information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type\nEncounter or is that something else\nWell the description that the Smith gave was would match Bigfoot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big foot may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nNow Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met\nAnybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that is coming to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nNow [laughter] and I should point out that you know you did address this maybe ... didn't hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people as far as you know\nWell no no killing them I I think only okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumping them in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit\nI followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came up came to pass\nI remember that story now that is a good one is it there are some other accounts in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person\nThere is a boring and ... you know\nSo well there's a story out of Wyoming\nWhat's your favorite color [noise]\nHitler than when he was running a song like that was your favorite\nHow about

all the sequence of events these amazing sequence of events that were things just kind of fell through the cracks where\nNo one was looking for them um combined to make this is such a tragedy and then to top it all off captain McVeigh the captain of the ship who lived used floating along on this or a raft\nDoesn't know if he's going to survive or not but he knows that his career is over and that he

the day\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference\nBut he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that that not enough to\nReally repair the damage\nAnd also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nBut I'm In later interviews Sarah found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that had in part had been kept in the day\nAnd he was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built arm started captain go Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help things on race this man\nYou tell the story in the book about um like sixty reunion a group of survivors and captain McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the group because\nYou know he was court martialed um you received as you noted the book these terrible letters from the family you didn't feel he's been punished enough\nAnd um you know\nReally troubling him for years afterward we shows are just like you you bend and how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it but when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just say would be playing right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nAnd when captain McVeigh got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receding him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSure it talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records are here with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past and if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and you know I had tried for years limb had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report and we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist and so\nInterestingly enough you know a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and saved fifty three men his\nBig his grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general started trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really\nTestimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because in the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed and so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new court of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights in four days\nWhen you talk about the white immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken I I Would do more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves that for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue only to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some\nTime to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nActually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them immediately got out in the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families and they held it in ... years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in general you know you got that story bottle love he becomes a shark hunter as a result of being one of those guys are\nJust removing seen those great I was going to use the clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in the book or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know one of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learn to\nThings that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from John So it's an essential part of this story history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home several accounts came home and\nSaw the movie or really impacted by it and especially the thin and only to find out their dad was on the ship the state of about well so and I'm pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way that that you know how your dad served in World War two\nO ... O W two three five five one seven\n\n\nZero here with me your thoughts are when you heard the news I think it was last year that the uh Indianapolis had been found a who is this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill ... who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and Sarah they found the ship and I didn't know what he was talking about it for in the\nMorning of and so you know dating my faculty\nAnd you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before the petrol group which was the vessel that recently responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts than they were the first ones to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours are calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their ships have been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened and then it happened in their lifetime or\nWhat [laughter] mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nOn winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information that ah you know were they were not entirely helpful and every step of the way to get this story told what about reaction to the book Simpson come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Sam Koch who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we said well through we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work of the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and and give the entire history\nAnd draw new analysis that very thing that happened in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nOh boy were were you nervous about that but he really really has endorsed the story and I went to his full court since he saw which is what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm hopeful big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but the west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California as a personal connection to the story I jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... or ... in the water and I'm Still have the one car being you know you can shoot ... you know\nIt'll be on one car being you know you can shoot sharks and stuff you know and I never saw my father ... years past ... years ago but I never saw him cry until you try and talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he a wiki on the U.S has a piece of tape delay or that that that you know the name of ...\nAnd I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone and I was thinking about that before I call not hot yeah what was the name of the ship but he did need ship was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talking it was horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talk about any of that\nEgypt all that and all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just it I mean part of the path of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or he was going to drink your interns may first class you know but he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years but then there's an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he would support the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer but that that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same case it didn't really know what he was getting into and and he needed at that had been found could probably buy a submarine that they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um a sailor his spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and so the cat in ...\nHe tried to get everybody out of there he said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with Iraq you have to be interesting if your dad was had been on that shit\nThanks Jerry appreciate it wild card line run and used in the morning on good\nMorning or my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade Doyle he was twenty six years old he was the Ensign doctor\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up\nOne of his uh I guess his seat just you know of all the member was and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got a letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this\nTo read this it talks about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pools these guys up kicking the sharks off their rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given them penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the uh view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been at some of the reunions but never did talk about this but the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages\nOf the whole account its its history its historical I Love my ... a share this with the young ladies if I can get a gathering information and I'll\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and Donna O R R gal there will get the information for you it will pass it on to win and Sarah and thank you for calling appreciate you sharing that I I'd like to see that myself\nThank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah there's fourteen still living class I don't assume that they still have a gathering do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all over the country with them and they they do have reunions every July and Indianapolis I'm\nAbout five or six I think six came this year and it is dwindling but you know we'll have an event on the USS Hornet on Veterans Day and two of the survivors will be there for that so you know the the youngest is Ninety One but\nThey're still sailors that heart and I think they can arm wrestle man when [laughter]\nKnow it's a generational thing well we're we're hearing these descriptions both from the two of you and from the callers about um how how these men reacted to it keeping bottled up inside you're right it would be different now people would be out there on Dr phil or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside\nBill or or getting a book deal or something but keeping it inside I don't know but it's entirely healthy but it certainly has changed when you agree\nYes absolutely and I I Do wonder whether maybe it wasn't a more healthier I I don't know I think yeah I think that generation may have been a lot more stable than we are now that uh it is an interesting contrast isn't it um

it exists anyway well this is talk now is if you want to claim asylum you come here\nYou you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we have to process them into the country then we don't have it for them so we released some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI I Would I Would have a I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression is that these people are not politically oppressed there's there's no such thing as\nEconomic asylum so a political asylum so if you come here for the good news for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just come here to to\nTo you know to you know pond yourself off on society without giving anything back with these people uh were wanted in their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again uh the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than

speak multiple languages don't speak English or ...\nYou know they don't want our backyards yes there are private private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from ... has everything to do with the fact that this become a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration period right in and it's it's just absurd let's let's some I Wonder\nIf that's the thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concerned about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they don't want to do that well I don't have time it's too dangerous in my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to the most of the world\nYes precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you

approval way way out [noise] um let's listen\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics\nBut he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics you know the constitution was written for moments like this bit assume that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed is why they made it so hard for us to get anything done [laughter] they basically bad\nThat we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we're proven them correct uh with with astonishing regularity reaction to that\nI I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump gun to violate the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution is liberals we're we're we're\nSupporting the constitution is the liberals were were ... were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and that one of the because of of all this other stuff that happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace were simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the ah the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a a leaky faucet\nBut [laughter]\nI I just there's nothing I
