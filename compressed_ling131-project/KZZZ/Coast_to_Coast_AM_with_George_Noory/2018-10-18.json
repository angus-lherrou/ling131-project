Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly thank Allen he the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on I'm going to craft a dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college did\nOkay I already knew that do have positive but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ... on the far right conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three\nSplit decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a far right conservative and Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's money going to an arm of the state government college and were being over tax that don't do that\nState government college and were being over tax that don't go that route as a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and hear the fang okay we spent a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spent ... you know even at the conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security but we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing it's probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans\nAnd we don't need to spend any money or that not only that the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuelan Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and\nI Hope I'm I he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much and you know [laughter] but it's an ... and all of the reason is here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total out of college dead and and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of that you want to let him get a credit card\nOkay with that loan but let me get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the student is college will drop like a rock and the I I Love I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here it's\n... can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look if we can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout can handouts\nAnd all these rich banker in these colleges can get their rates on student looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nAnd and okay and they use the third or are we uh got your point there ... Allen\n[noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of a sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill go with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if\nYou had a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means\nIf that does not happen then we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum of the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWell and you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate\nIs that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large they could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity therefore price reduction in academia um\nSo yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other lender has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco head\nWell George you said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they even pay for my books\nBut the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling and so I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me well honey if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest\nOn it oh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that oh yeah and in life\nOh this did you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you ... over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars just like gallons ever paid off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark [noise]\nNo I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor and ... some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think yelling yeah these these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship for any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay it back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them a private banks and\nSo the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on uh probably the income based repayment program\nSo they're a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital or the nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments\nWell interest continues to accrue on that loan show\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program\nAnd actually get the loan for given a and I might add that any amount forgiving under the I'd be our program is taxable income so twenty five years\nYou get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals rate ... probably even exchanged the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nThough the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nGoing to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and

R. dot com [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to this is our final segment with Alan calling us as we talk about these student loans scam Ellen are the student loans that are out there now hurting or helping the economy [noise]\n[noise] well I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars more than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation\nA auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nUh so certainly it's hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels\nTypically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do I'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not\nA parent or to the naked eye\nIt's going to call Fresno, California to get things started here west the Ron Paul go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you pick Michael thank you very much Georgia now them [noise] um I graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe was talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I uh got\nThirty four thousand thirty seven thousand that I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that graduations and\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a ... um [noise] there's something called a the finding\nOut what that is is that like a listing of pretty much like a courses you cook or trade that trade you chose yeah and what it is is a bit of course he'll uh the reason they're in the situation because they all by job placement rate so if you were\nFrom a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that brought so it actually took me from I Would have to say December two thousand Fifteen to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris and email\nI'm surprised that we bonded um but uh the avenue that I went to get a laugh or give it to write a cover letter M I submitted a pretty much with a cover letter I had to put money on an ad that pretty much if I put it all out there what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah you know what it was the fraud that got it reduce I guess right\nAh yes that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the old college commercials what the problem with this life long job placement it's good\nSo what how I false advertising you exactly so when the school shut down there goes your call ... ... there goes your your life long but it's the right you got that right ah interesting Alan isn't it\nThat you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up a at some other point and show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for year degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... ... you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of delay and slow walk this ... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who were light to buy their college is\nA than there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be because believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh\nBut he's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by typically a for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWell you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... NATO provided to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not similarly per student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned a note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues that the the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that it is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that alone is not\nLittle ... little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up alone\nGo to pat in Minneapolis east of the Rockies hyped ... go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda of\nThe destruction of the Social Security program because\nThere are families with co signers grandparents parents analysts do it one of them are ever going to get a security forum on a question and I think Justin alright if if I own a house and I find on one of these student loans\nThat does that blame that on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans yep\nIt goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a yeah that's a great question um to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now and has been passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one of the things that you want to say family\nHas already where multi generation the grandparents and parents and their kids are never going to get any thoughts scary\nBut it just you know that if you have if you want to help but still it and tear up the already you write a check to the school or a money order or travelers check or whatever and you can hear you now says well here's my transcript for the last semester you want to help me this semester\nAnd when you hand over or whatever you're going to help them with don't forget this part of a pat on the back and say the whole family is proud of you for being such a great student in such a hard worker\nGod or a message from the station and the American planning association\nMm skied\nDown here what are you like you know ... ... what are you doing in your sense of ... it's been around since ... mom took me to the force last year and it's not even get me a long time to get here you're right I should get out yeah the first is not that ... have come to the\nPoint where the more adventurous you lead checkout discovered the force dot org for cool places nearby you by the U.S Forest Service and the ad council\nHi I'm Tim Daly we all need to be more aware of our health over fifty take pneumococcal pneumonia some adults think they're too active or healthy to get sick but as we age our immune system naturally weakens increasing our risk my mom had new cocktail pneumonia and it was serious she was weak had difficulty breathing in a terrible cough\nIf you're over fifty talk to your doctor about your risk and see if you're up to date on your vaccinations learn more at W.

I was going to say through through\nUm his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do a disservice hair he'd be it for the ... contract quite quite openly and legitimately and through the the Santa contractual\nProcedure and he'd go hey you launch chunk of that too quick but of course justice the the government requires that people

so to speak they had they had to have government security parents but also the commercial non disclosure\nAgreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other\nThing in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see a lot of speculation was always taught at

practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be rigorous on accident and winnowing speculating might say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so hopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know\nI'm only ... where we don't know that these things\nWell what's the bottom line with what you got [noise] what's that\nWell [laughter] I I didn't want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler\n[laughter]\nI think one one thing that I can say which I think it's a pretty good summary off of what I think has gone down\nIs that I Would say their laws and I use that would deliberately a believer faction if I can call it died within the U.S government\nAnd some of those people were permanent employees and some were can tractors and this believe a fraction who let the phenomenon was absolutely rail and and they were to write to not have calls\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it didn't who out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal\nAnd actually then that believe a fraction became or or certainly interacted with overlapped with with a tab [noise]\nAnd they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to\nUse those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government with taxpayers' money and and that of course and gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about this because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now of course talk of\nCongressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but\nBut the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think there was a believer ...\nThey made them move they came up against some roadblocks couple of different road blocks one right thought was simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive on so the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do\nThe other sort of road blocks that they had this is very controversial is they have\nA cold is a religious road blog from from some senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for that you I thought it was from the paranormal would demonic and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with it\nWell\nWell what do we\nDo we won't have anything to do with oh well\nI mean um it it was started eat whatever it was but I I as I say that there were people\nIn the end you can probably still all ... members deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here and like come on come on again in there for a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm a pretty extreme with the S.\nAnd in the the the individual who wrote that the ... the fight intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense code name project ... he would not want to go to go too far down that road he had some play the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book of the issues I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and lack I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea of UFOs might be demonic\nJust you know and there were a lot of ... that believe that\n[noise] yeah and it's

and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism is the sort of [noise] Nicole or intellectual\nA human that skepticism but I think most people\nI associate

believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things that the only call it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another real these by these people wouldn't skeptics

to close the cultural back with Nick Pope Nick do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and and then fight the um law to oil in in the what's now being a ten year program to the class finally\nGo heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFracture um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\nThat does make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are killing some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly\nPut yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy um they said I'm\nA ... if you don't mind actually go to document in front of me home please give us some good coach from yeah this is this\nActually haven't officially been released yet\nThere will be tonight will um the fat can them\nHum there will be tonight it will like I'm\nThe same can them critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument something exists\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however\nRussian act coughed attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented the threat is the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this gets quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying\nTo parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any defense interest but no no no threat and yet in a way they were trying to fight documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nSimply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of\nWhat it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins type Jacobs where we are always\nSaying you know this whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack\nAnd and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually in the ...\nFor um working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge over all of this this\nIs a kind of them we don't know the values but intelligence some military circles and we say that threat is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you work out ways of this is a threat and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat\nIt is well we have some idea about the capability of you I pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files stay quite clearly you know speeds and maneuvers way in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability\nWe we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about his intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable\nIn the u._k. the astronomer royal so much in race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to apply to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics\nAnd the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want what can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that but I mean there's a well\nWhat I can say is that there there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay our rail that they do routinely penetrate tall already defense\nRegion um but in the u._k. the U. S. and presumably elsewhere\nAnd they all seemed by pilots they are trying to write all they performed speech and maneuvers that we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip\nStory we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nNo matter of fact let's talk about the navy judge what's your take on\nWell so far we got three free videos\nI'm pretty amazing too yeah I\nAbsolutely I've I've sat down and watch these things with um pilots with I I've actually being in a situation where I've I've I've watched these things and been sitting around a table with with\nThings and been sitting around a table with with a commercial airline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've ... this around and and nobody's saying that this is is fake or anything and of course of course it's it's not um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to to people being interviewed makeup nonstop for everything\n[laughter] I'm sure you've probably interviewed a few of them don't want to name any names I Hope you will will respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I don't know\nWell I Do I mean because you're not a skeptic by any means but you're a researcher and a darn good one in saying that you don't know that's fine with me\nThank you I mean I I'm not no I don't think time I'm a skeptic ... a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of person and\nAgain let's be honest there are there are quite a few in this\nThis field I mean the real real life in my experience of looking at this government the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics versus believers and the idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S mystery is is I think\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way\nBut but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos from five I think will be something that will come over the next few weeks and months there is always the pressure\nGoing on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum\nThese sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be many many more videos Lou Elizondo has said that there are other people involved\nIn in old less have said they're all ... of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... the cod or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before haven't we [laughter] yeah\nWhat do you think your thoughts are on President Trump's request for space for a\nWhile it's it's it's interesting and it's certainly cause more than a few rumors and conspiracies\nI guess in

we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and\nAnd then ... the um lost to files in in the what's now being a ten year program to the class find release them\nGo heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\nLast ... make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly\nPut yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy um they said I'm a ... if you don't mind actually going to document in front of me please give us some ... yeah this is a this\nActually hasn't officially been released\nYet I'm Will be tonight it will like I'm\nThe same can them critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exist\nThey have never shown any hostile attend\nIntent and therefore kennel represent a threat however\nRussian act Croft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent the threat is the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this is quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any defense in ... but no no no threat\nAnd yet in June of ... they were trying to fight documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nSimply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of a threat\nWell it it it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins and Dave Jacobs where we're always\nSaying you know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack\nAnd and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually in a ...\nFor um working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or robbed of this this is a kind of them\nWe don't know the values but intelligence and military sickles we say that threat is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count whether there's a threat and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of you I pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files they quite clearly you know speeds and maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability we we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about his intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is\nHow 'bout you behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal so much and race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said\nIt may be trying to approach to try and figure this out he said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics and the\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I don't know that but I mean visitation who's a well\nWhat I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you pay a rail that they do routinely penetrate tall already defense\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U. S. and presumably elsewhere and they all seen by pilots they are trying to um right now they performed speech and maneuvers\nThat we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip story we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nNo matter of fact let's talk about the navy jets what's your take on\nWell so far we got free free videos\nI'm pretty amazing do yeah I absolutely\nI've I've sat down and watch these things with um pilots with I I've actually being in a situation where I've\nI've I watch these things and been sitting around a table with with a commercial airline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've found this around and and nobody's saying that this is is fake or anything and of course of course it's it's\nNot um [noise]\nWe don't know again and I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to to people being interviewed makeup nonstop for everything [laughter]\nI'm sure you probably interviewed a few of them they don't want to name any names\nI Hope you will will respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I know\nWell I Do I mean you're not a skeptic by any means but you're a researcher darn good one in the scene that you don't know that's fine with me\nThank you I mean I I'm not no I think time I'm a skeptic ... a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of\nPerson and again let's be honest they're all they're all quite a few in this field I mean we all real life in my experience of looking at this government the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics vicious believers\nThe idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S probably mystery is is I think you know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way\nBut but to go back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos from five I think will be something that will come over the next few weeks and months there is always the pressure\nGoing on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents been going on for years um\nWe have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be many many more videos Lou Elizondo has said that there are other people involved\nIn in ... less have said that there are part of course none of these people\nWant to preempt ... D O D or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before haven't we [laughter] yeah\nWhere do you think your thoughts are on President Trump's request for a speech porch\nWell it's it's it's interesting and it's simply cost more than a few\nRumors and conspiracies I I guess in one sense I'm not maybe I'm not surprised and maybe I don't think it's going to us as big a deal as as some people too I mean clearly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "18"}
