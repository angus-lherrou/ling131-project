that I mean that's what I feel\nRight no arguing yeah kind of what what's what's going to happen\nGoing forward ... ... is it right now we have a polarized country and the the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties and early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position at six years for that yelling at me [laughter]\nThat's good show in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nKen two questions so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more HIV patients that are ... and one issue than the people have a ... you know then\nAnd how this she said that's a nice and explosion basically people pick and choose a their information uh even that are a professional level what what's half the size of the center for the few look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost a year and it just hasn't worked at it and then the federal level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office to hide or whatever [noise] ah so maybe the lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon ah\nI Know they get criticized for putting out small for prior to send I can understand that but at the same time this stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even a New York for example I got I got this great gloves shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I mean but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again [laughter] ... inside just rolling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question go\nAhead of us and that's an absence again Joe Joe\nKnow now that that's for an example of explosion that video you know like half with everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based just how should people if\nIf there's video based just how should people if they're trying to move ahead a in the world\nJust pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize odd because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this plant that for that the something one that's just so so much that's a nice you know like\nYou like a total of ... on the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your term here's your question of information that we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of the the the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answers\nBut ... says how do you sift through this what you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't come to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we opened the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the innards of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\n[noise] we've got a company that shift radios they make radios and to make darn good radio she Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a ... it's amazing\nThat's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA ... you know and that online retail is will exceed the temperatures that where it is now is probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job they're\nUm or conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere\nIt's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know as you know suffering some issues right now some serious\nIssue I mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah to Selma runs out yes [laughter]\nYeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house and um but either Springs Florida and and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and a\nHalf and half of Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it or we're going to come up with an executive rental forward and and that is\nGoing to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't have the rental is going to be very big\nWon't even got the company like you're being beat up the rent on house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and the solicitor through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... cool\nYeah I Would have subscribed to that what you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise] one of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to you know remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge their biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the uh the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K C direct dot com K.

because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or vote\nOr there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and\nAnd and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nWhere to science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah we were to science fit in\nWell I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've\nDone a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked all awful lot of questions and have done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model or\nIs it how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on now in the mail us with that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that I okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my\nOne way of looking at me is that I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am of being physically being but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world and you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and uh and and that's kinda how I see it and\nAnd I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's the physical form and then there's the spiritual form\nA that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the ... the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really ever die\nAnd then sign was you have documented thirty for pure ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book okay I have I saved some of the more\nWell I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nWell sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I\nUh early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how does your new because we'll save a lot of it for the next book but you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not and another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have ...\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different organizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died\nAnd I'm somebody else now I think I Am\nAnd it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those ah you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor\nOf my truck or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second Harry was hurdling through a red light oh it was terrible\nAnd and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out\nYeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out of so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuvered through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again\nWhen I I think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and in the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there ... there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now\nAnd and that that's what I felt like an eye and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident\nKnows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that or\nYou know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God but um so it's I I I ...\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to would be island there is a to bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the\nExact way ... and I was running right towards the cliff\nAnd I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this warmth\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was yelling\nSomebody's watching Uber's there's there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about\nSome of these other thirty three experiences you had a or any

you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the way that it that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure these\nThings as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary opt out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a ah when I was about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school or out of out of the University of Washington I was living in my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress\nAnd a ... just the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff 'cause just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds so I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah she had this she had the old hat and singer right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen\nAnd I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I went in to to I fell asleep well later that probably early in the morning I woke up to\nA very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress that that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor and I I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me and an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasted it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever and ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over\nWas you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating I immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well you know once you come over in in in the morning and\nI did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't see it happen\nAnd I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or major angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat\nI could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're ...\nAnd would you know no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel\nAnd uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get ya and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the humans but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing or are there was actually a a ... I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison in Manheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany and uh there was a a a counselor at the\nPrison of all people of counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a powerful war locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across a like goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh\nCeramics instructor there and he I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and a or no no he had a demon algae book that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head and it turned out to be a demon head\nNorth fashioned and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor and he had the Steven ... book\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mid ... and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting the end\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm I'm gonna freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go on freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was the was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girl friend left I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden\nIt's lips started to move and it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army and that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then it kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in and she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate let me in and then she says what does that and\nShe pointed to it and I said oh that's this thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I have to throw it away because it started to interact with me and I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be ... somewhat good\nOr you invite them and that's when\nYou can have trouble you think you invite them in with a weed you board oh I I don't play around with we'd you boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nAirmen

happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this far and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the whole winning singer I Hope no not a balloon [laughter] we'll just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped so I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers\nBecause it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there that the the item stopped and I you know you know and I didn't have that feeling that somebody pulling me off to bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that\nI'm going to hinge moves that when you went through that red light and you made it through a lives loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what the this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others and trying to figure this out\nYou know and and are you know very chronically under funded because there's you know it's difficult for them to get funding and I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this this spiritual world works\nAnd it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do I I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there are Charlotte's ... out there and and then and there are some real people that do for a living and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living you know fairly being songs are providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of imaging and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but\nUh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nA ... and there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I I I that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and\nThe things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel that I that I have to do it and I want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kinda like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you evaluated for his Bruce up it's just a question then they could wait time is a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce\nIt's almost I charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I miss my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your\nNear accident and the intersection and job comment and question the comet is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam Hindu was some voters some dour some and and all of the indigenous\nTraditions from around the world whether they're called angels are being supplied whatever my question to you set you metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection how can the average man they average woman develop\nCultivate the well a close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often the light lie dormant sure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know\nPretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have they they accept it more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation I just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut\nSo things kept happening but now I've I've learned to through meditation or ... what I call walking meditation all explaining I'm I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk\nAnd uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer a and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm to be focused but be very calm\nAnd as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\nBruce Lee and said go ahead yeah\nNo that's the best way I can I can explain it I think it's a it's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five

the sole high in his book timeless where do we get the book Bruce\n[noise] well uh you can get it on Amazon and uh I think it was on Barnes and noble and maybe some other places but I think the primary places Amazon there seems to be pretty good price on Amazon right now so\nWell that's a great way now let's talk about the story of\nHell\nYou've done a chapter about ill ill is empty call it\nHell is empty well that is the uh that's actually one of the uh the the demon stories ha okay okay\nYeah I used the quote from a Shakespeare that uh uh the hell is empty all the demons or hear all the devils are here you know that so I yeah I use that and that but it and speaking about health I think that's a that's a good topic\nAh that that's one of the questions that I asked my spirit friends\nUh I said well what happens to the bad people are they they're in the spirit world with you and\nAnd uh they they they answer that I got a was kind of interesting it was well there there are these demonic elements in in the spirit world but they're not necessarily in the same\nZIP Code I guess that's the way it is to describe it uh and I think that what what I understand is that people who have done very very bad things you know on this earth and the physical form a are probably hanging out with those folks and that in that area of the spirit world\nBut they do get a chance to come back and try to make it right and I think that can take a very very long time many probably many incarnations for them to\nTry to to get things right and uh I I think that goes along with with you know a lot of eastern religions to talking about bad karma and that kind of stuff [noise] uh so that's that's my impression of what a what helped me maybe\nLet's go to rural in England or in California your neck of the words Bruce go ahead rolling\nOh my goodness hello ms snoring and Dr be tied there I'm a longtime listener and definitely a first time caller I'm missing ... at the borders in Pasadena before it closed journey you're\nA couple of years ago only sixteen years old with the numbers lady yeah I'm not sure if you remember that I sure do I just\nWant to say how incredibly proud I Am of both of you and especially my professor and what an honor it is a goal to view a please continue doing what you're doing best\nAh my question to Dr B is um can anyone tap into this or is this something you're just lucky enough to be born with and able to do and I'll take my question off the air\nThank you all and I I Know what you're going to say Bruce go ahead\nWell I think I think everybody has this the the capability to do it or do you have the inclination or are you willing to take a chance are you willing to also to protect yourself in in the process to realize that there are\nA you know faults paths here in there and uh so I I I think it is it is possible for anybody like the the last caller a you know the same type of advice that we can we can cultivate these things and and do so very cautiously and carefully and and slowly\nAnd uh and it is something that and I think that the last caller to a Thomas a had a good point he said all that it unites this idea of angels unites the whole world and I would I Would go farther and say the paranormal unites all cultures all around the world it's a connection point that we all have\nPoachers all around the world it's a connection point that we all have and I think as we learn more and scientists help us more I think that's going to connect us more and and then perhaps bring bring better times for us because we certainly need the help\nWell we sure do don't we Renee's with us in San Francisco first time caller Hi Renee\nHi guy a I'm a Bruce I'm the four oh George before I get to my question for both the

BP's well uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I I think\nThat they can be very helpfully because the ... the folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign\nThat that they're there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kinda sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing but a oftentimes is just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not too worried about them anymore\nAnd what do you mean by you could be said\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nA sense that is that something you'd like to share\nWith me why you feel that when he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either\nAnd it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers or wanted to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to see the names or whatever but uh it's so\n... sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know was\nWas that emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy some times in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I I did not know relieved that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that uh maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\nThis is Louisa recently she got help going on line okay so that green button [noise] is this your first video chat\nFor

having you know their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\nYou think they should have adjusted that they could have prevented some things have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nWell yeah oh for sure yeah toy cigarettes makes me crazy you know I I saw this um um yeah but if you follow toys are us on in the wall Street Journal and in you know it's it's

the sales decline of of a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know it's a real problem is that what you know what they say in the yard you know I read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a ... you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls\nThe real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent fewer kids under ten now than there were ten years ago he I think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it makes me crazy and you know I was seriously Georgia if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if your if your General Motors or or Amazon\nOr your ... you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nMeal they do but how do you look into a crystal ball and make these predicts if you're running a business\n... ... what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was um [noise]\nI had an opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officers in the hospitality industry about two years ago and\nAnd everyone was there ... and ... a share to him as their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and I'm In the ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer\nWas you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why a ... you know how they think how they buy\nAnd Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room small and your lobbies bigger\nNow what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics is yeah is\nIt because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but he you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off\nThis was Nineteen Ninety eight and I and I said I'm ... so your\nYour sales are ... are are ongoing fight and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I should what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said well we could they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nThere was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight and he said what does that mean this is what that means is you know your your last gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales\nOne from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because and not paying attention to demographic you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out but if you want to understand where money came from it came from people help people and you will understand\nWell isn't it simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after ... and find out some of the thing\nDemographic you need to go after eventually and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people I'll find out from them what did they do what do they like where did they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] jokes are too smart [laughter] but but that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense is not so common ... said that\nYou know I I Do um I'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I say that's the boomers\nEverybody can see that the boomers all sat there and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large group six out of ... and I said that's Jenn ... got free people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials are born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them\nI said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nEl ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening is that what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you don't you want to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off and you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operations [noise]\nI I I I tell folks are shut listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I sit and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nIs it I said you you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutritious [laughter] no it's it's for French fries and\nGarden list of what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] it's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nOr it in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\n[noise] [noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that\nUh in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in two thousand fight and they will they will be a a they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven and we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million or three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier\nBy what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies the here\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back underground back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does [laughter] it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't take about this because it precipitating almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it has\nThese things well it has to a large degree um\nThe\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that and say people are still people when when you have a\nLarge number of people that are consumer or a specific product in a small number of people that consume a specific product the large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the the the the smartphone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume\nSo uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce head of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that's [noise] that's simple isn't it\nWell it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume\nSmaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were blocked by baby boomers\nAre Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um yeah I'm a young companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to\nSelling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and now she finds and they can't be for small\nPoint my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age she calls me over Cuba's young woman now we're not getting married like you to do and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it it's funny 'cause I'm kinda figured that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of of a of a marriage um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are bought outside of the\nThe uh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that whether it's a you know we're talking a lot of our business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing I think\nThe culture is going to do with the culture is going to do and right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do\nJust like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years and ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did\nJust simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up in a you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to

think of Amazon crushing bricks and mortar stores\nThe man was on crushing bricks and mortar stores\nYeah you know you say crushing because the Amazon or you know online retail is about ten percent of total retail is not crushing anything\nIt's a ... inch cheers was a cabinet anachronism anyway you know the the the retailers that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\nYou think they should've adjusted nothing could have prevented some things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure yeah toy cigarettes makes me crazy you know I I saw this um um you know but if you follow toys are us on in the wall Street Journal and in you know it's it's

ago that said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones\nThat they're no longer a you know they no longer have any consideration for hot wheels were Barbie dolls\nThe real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent pure kids under ten now than there were ten years ago you think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales declined\nYeah could be it makes me crazy and you know I was seriously Georgia if you have a twenty five percent decrease in size up your market I don't care if your if your General Motors or or Amazon\nBy your ... you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they do but how do you look into a crystal ball and make these predictions if you're running a business\n... ... yeah what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was I'm\nAn opportunity to speak to the chief marketing officer in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there she ... a share Tim was their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the ... the industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now and and uh ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and I'm sitting around and round table\nAnd and they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how to market on social media and and American Express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why a ... you know how they think how they buy\nAnd Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room small and your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics is\nYeah is it because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but he you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand\nAnd all of a sudden sales started trailing off this was Nineteen\nNinety eight and I and I said I'm\n... so your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I should what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he said what we can they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said\nIt was a pause and he said Nineteen Ninety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean this is what that means is you know your your last guest just checked out of your hotel\nAnd their their sales went from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographics you know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people help people and you will understand\nWell is it is simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after bench ally and find out some of the things they enjoy and look at those trends you find out that you know if they're\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people I'll find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go do they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\n[laughter] drugs are too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic yeah common sense it's not so common bulk here said that you know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience of five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and they say that's the boomers\nEverybody can see that the boomers all sat there and I'll say okay if you are born before Nineteen eighty five sit down and ... and another large group six out of ... and I said that's Gen x and their tender about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nWell you ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing geniuses something slipping\nI Know you're not you're about to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their overseas operations ...\nI I I I tell folks are shut listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I sit and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition you know it's it's for French fries\nGarden let's see what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] it's exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they are if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nIt in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't sell you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trench or they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah well you know it's funny you say that uh in Nineteen ... we we have a new generation of called Generation Z and Generation Z started in a two thousand fight and they will they will be\nA but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier\nBy what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller you\nKnow that's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free with the ... zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd welcome back and they're going back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] [noise] well it has to a large degree um\nThe\nKnow and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nLarge number of people that are considered a specific product at a small number of people that consume a specific product the large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds ... but the ... the smartphone has only aged folks and\nPhone has a only aged folks in their ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that the thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that's [noise] that's simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean ... who is out there saying\nWell okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause they the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were blocked by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um yeah I'm a guilt companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to\nSelling as many SUVs to this\nOther group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation X amount you find that make it easy for a small\n... point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she's just pop out you know kids are age she calls me over Cuba's young woman now we're not getting married like you choose to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock and they're they're born outside of a of a marriage [noise] um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the\nThe uh uh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they\nJust simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the issue of sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies live became Republicans\nIn all cases [laughter]\nNo not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because they this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four in fifty three we have a diminutive puppy population of of indigenous people that were born here\nThey were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nA superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... where would you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a cushion in between of generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing a cushion\nWell what we did in ... so ...\nAnd that cushion yeah well what we did in ... so ... you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have have the have nots but middle age and and I'm In\nA middle income uh our occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to there's becoming a change their war I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting a bang for a dollar a year or you were converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be

presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but if you let them about what they did\nWithout defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done is dignify but at the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I\nMean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nBut you know yeah I you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you monitor yourself in it and just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and ended up like that\nIt exactly George C ... and I I respect the the um the criticism I really

is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen it you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight no arguing yeah kind of ...\nWhat's what's going to happen going forward ... ... is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties and early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly\nYeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position it's fiction for that yelling at me [laughter]\nThat's good zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nKen two questions so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more ... than a ... and one issue than ... ... people have it you know then\nAnd how the system that's a nice and explosion basically it's a lot of people pick and choose a their information uh even that are a professional level what what are the size of the sense that if you look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work\nTwenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked out it and then the federal level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office tools that in the height or whatever [noise] ah so maybe the lacking creative conscious something my second question would be about Amazon ah\nI Know they get criticized putting out small for prior to send I can understand that but at the same time this stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even a New York for example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I mean but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] ... inside just blowing on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question go\nAhead of us and that's an odd cents again Joe Joe\nYou know now that that's for an example of explosion that video you know like half with everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this clandestine into something whether it's just so so much of the nation like\nYou like a total of ... on the ... what good does it do that ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your attorney who's requires\nA lot of information that we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of heat that the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answers\nBut ... is how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't I come to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information\nAnd in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the innards of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think it's just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nWe've done a company that shift radios they make radios and to make darn good radio she cream company and I I usually get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want to deliver to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a ... it's amazing\nIt's amazing\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the boomers\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA you know and that online retail ... to ... feet you know the temperature that word is now it's probably go to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured\nUm they Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job there\nUm for conditions and things like that but I mean they're they're hired people so there's displacement teach so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a\nCommercial real estate is you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of

Connecticut and a\nHalf and half of Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it we're going to come up with an executive rental forward and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't have the ... got to be very\nWell you've got the company like air being beat up the rent a house houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... oh\nYeah I Would I Would subscribe to that is what you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise]\nOne of the things that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to you know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them ...\nOh yeah K. juicy direct dot com K.

with a model\nOr the how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on a cell is with that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh\nThat I okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my\nOne way of looking at me is that I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the sub atomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and uh and and that's kinda how how I see it and\nAnd I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book where\nWe experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks in the road of time throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two partners the physical form and then there's the spiritual form a that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the ... the title of the book which is timeless that\nWe don't really ever die\nAnd then ... you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book he'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test\nThe waters with the first book okay I have I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first one\nSounds like we're going to have your back about this\nBut based on the reaction of the first one\nWell sounds like we're going to have you back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third but planned to so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how does your new because and we'll save a lot of it for the next book but you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other pure allele universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those ah you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of monument or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light\nOh it was terrible and and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay and he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out yeah he\nHe is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out of so what was going to happen that I can see was that we were going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time and the world to figure out how I was\nGoing to maneuver your way around a yeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side\nThere was hockey and going on and the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again\nAnd I I think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just internal now\nAnd and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because in another dimension which we\nMight have had this horrible accident knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that\nYou know that there could have been people killed and it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so were the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I ...\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a\nTo bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak on for the yeah the\n... and I was running right towards the cliff\nAnd I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this warmth\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was yelling\nSomebody's watching Uber's there's there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these\nOther thirty three

welcome back to coast to coast George nor you once you were back with Bruce ... book is called timeless Bruce what about any demonic situations have you stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately that is that is\nAlso out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and ...\nThings as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a a lasts about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of the University of Washington I limit my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress\nAnd a ... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff because just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds so I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah she had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen\nAnd I was just staring at her and she had it was either it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went into I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a column of fire that was coming up out of the floor and I I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself and no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me and an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh\nWell you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't it did happen and I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or major angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's it that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you know no it was it was it was very real very reel\nTo reel and uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get ya and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story\nWell the other one uh also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a um I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison in Manheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany we're West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people counsellors like a senior in Seattle\nA counselor at the prison of all people counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a powerful word locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical been interested so we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across a like goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move\nIn on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and a or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head and it turned out to be a demon had Rhode Island fashioned\nAnd this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor and he had the steam analogy book\nAnd ah he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare this guy and he said well that's that's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were\nMaybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get him to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was all the time was the intent was good right\nIt was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left I mean the the uh the roommate left\nAnd I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the sing all of a sudden it's lips started to move and it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army\nAnd that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then it kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate let me in and then she says what does that and she pointed to it and I said oh that's this thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy and she said\n... ... you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it\nStarted to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be\nSomewhat good are these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them and that's when\nYou can have trouble you think you invite them in with a weed you board", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "30"}
