[laughter] the\nThe thing is that the we are seeing him a moment coming in this century and the first half of the century where religions will see the other side of the prophecies the part the door it's been shot to you know and there's indications in prophecy\nIn Christian prophecy even that shows that what's on the other side of this revelation will completely change the concept and leave behind even the identity of what was the Christian what it was to be Muslim what it wants to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door\nAnd what's on the other side is completely different that's all I can do right now\nI I Can't look at night\nA friend that's all I can do right now\nI I Can't look at night go by without asking you about the middle east and then we'll start taking phone calls and winding up your for you what's your take cynically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria and Iran and this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it it follows the prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made and Tim production for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and is always long story short the\nThe not Saddam's prophecies that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this is Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vessels\nWhich are described in an anagram as Arab vessels\nBob Barr a dire OB in in French at that that kind of a rebel against their their their masters and drag Russian America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours is there we've rescinded a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five of course it was with the dictator the shock over through their government two years earlier that was democratically

bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side uh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally\nSo we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\n... city in Syria\nWe're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um ... of ... or ... the president of turkey and water and food and\nGot together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone\nAnd take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are\nAre are are\nRefugees all crowd in that area owns a horrible what what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... stage in film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them and some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still as he started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime have chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused a you know we have thirty Russian warships as this time around\nAnd then the near equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another in to a nuclear confrontation missiles of\nThe missiles of October in sixty two could become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm the astrology kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to a long and short deadline if if we kinda move up what may be the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year they delayed they're putting the delayed his address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted law this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been in an arms race\nShows it's very interesting look at how we've been an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a Harley report and so the Russians declared in March first that pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's half seven hundred billion if you add the other side to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed we're doing the same thing\nSo uh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... to the spirit was channeled by ... and ... who is considered the Swedish Edgar Casey Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and traps\nAnd he he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like Soviet Union and least in this economic sense\nThat's true ah with more censorship that's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say from my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with that in the country I grew up with\nNo that's not true in in ... and the

my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because my experience with\nSuicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide\nMost people encounter um basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained [noise]\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of the whole other dimensions of my life\nI'm all these years I've never known this\nWay I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when it came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park that I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me says I could just keep walking a beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible and clear have to see how they're really one they're really they're play of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um\nIt was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay\nThis is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff if I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass where I just began\nSobbing sobbing and suddenly all of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all [laughter] and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little old eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering its sleeve in Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes\nIn significant I it's so the story is really an a it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about the whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the messiah has a book\nThese things that I haven't done since I did the messiah is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and I had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something that looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's uh the people magazine of an seaboard Dane and I've watched how she touched his cheek\nOn the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his\nSons and all about it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one\nI as I have been in my private life\nWhich I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nUm Hangst and polarity\nMy inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ...\nPoint this center of silence and peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you as meditation the science\nOf self observation is is what what more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and it's still prophetic\nBut it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nHuge let's take some calls here in the ... minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Hope Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing your experience on that but my question John yes for a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are not enough for dead on fact dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest is my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty and ah so my answer to that is\nIf any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting death [noise] um I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look\nBeyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not\nOverwhelmed ... you can be

wanted destruction in any form to any human I mean look at every single country hate each other out there they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway real quick to always my dad moved to New Jersey I think in my career as a special ed teacher\nUh I start working with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristics that normal people have this war began to feel like I was blessed George ... uh you have to work with these kids who appreciate that that's when I started trying to pay back\nFor just being normal so I started a prayer life I always had a prayer life but I saw it apparently this is a prerequisite for white had this ...\nI mean these poor kids that had nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nI had these terrible Kansas and that would draw for them and they always they wanted us so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are ... ...\nAnd they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that the ... in in the lines are with numbers more but some of them had says terrible if your Kansas say they would rule follow in your own coloring they withdrew their mouth is rule of law\nWas in school you were at\nWell I was I was ... yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay\nI bought I clean it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them or and so it ... you know they were learning the skills that they were never going to use a you know there was no really cure for them back then even tell you there's really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids needed two hours for lunch with the teacher said would help feed them uh there's no papers to correct the bigger kids that hadn't been in a room used to move back as long as I enrolled is you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put up with I N roll isn't it put the boxes on him to shut them down and\nYou know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this is this still supply I enrolled lives in my class I'd line up the kids I take\nUntil it can get a box put it on the island world he was flight adapt to the next kid they ... they would open it up to fight it down to ... put something in and decided down to the next ... tape and you know so that's what they did if I had plenty of\nTime so George I\nKnow how to park and so I said bought tend to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to the south\nWe doing two jobs John\nYeah I mean it is that thing especially that they didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too\nSo um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night out there looking for fun now a lot of 'em real stand the people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark side of things these people are like little wicked you don't have a conflict of course to alcohol and drugs to commit adultery or anything they can get their hands on\nAnd a good portion of these people were atheists or they went to the cost a little bit\nMake sure I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bother me in fact if it's over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers and [noise] and I bought it with these people and I and I knew them you know\nBut I felt that these people like ships in the night\nWithout a rider any way that I Would take him to do with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in the state that I thought nobody should die\nThen we're the last ... unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um yeah I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing this book is going to the teacher has\nIt teaches you the nose I self you know knows I mean it's I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means knowing the truth about you you are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what you do it and analyze what you believe about yourself you might find it completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I tried to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into his name is Chris he was a button that he worked right alongside and he was an atheist than there used to make fun of God used to make fun as you just used to make fun of ...\nAnd he smoked and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't oh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from school my school job my night job [noise] ah we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but you didn't know what\nI Know he had this ... yeah it's about forty years and in a few months and he died within a few months\nBut I Would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more vision of George because if a diagnosis I\nHe does such a terrible state he died in the state and no one should die and uh I I felt like helpless form now in my religion George were told that people fall into held like snowflakes from the sky especially if there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew in bonded with and I felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long ago I'd give me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand there still got left and then our class that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was a prerequisite of why this human creature this compelled to assess my house and they'll build that mosaic through your piece by piece right down to every single detail\nNo one who can really as you well let me ask you this will join this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not the only absolutely not because I've never had like a and I've never you know I never had a I invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use\nA week he boards or I never use terror cause I mean I I Believe that opens the door for me to like just to come in and I don't think anybody does that because I now I think if you allowed to speak to come in and he'll do harm I think if admitting him to do is worse on the other time\nIt has no there's no doubt if you\nAnd the only other time it had\nNo there's no job what if you if you invited in each coming\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you do if I was just\nAbsolutely not I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology we'll talk with discuss that too but the only other really other time or or you know I told her I worked in ... that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book and if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown though that's such a topic we don't touch we don't let which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] but anyway\nPeople probably why it was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the only other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul ... we've had just a rare a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it killed him very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died at the same\nTime rather was unfortunate for you to get\nAre you OK get that she has me are you are right yeah what was the ... disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull you and I'll tell you\nSo poorly wakes up and he has the same symptoms my dad had\nHis fancy dollars nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital and at the hospital he dies on a hospital bed and when I went to visit them later on he said which on it you know and I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I got on a hospital bed I left my body\nHe said I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically ... find that kept me back to life again if they'd be late and not on comedy and\nYeah and uh alarms going off and said like when I talk about that fifth fifth dimension that spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body they said in the hospital\nHe said to me it\nAnd it and then it was a dark side of that room he says and demons came from a small team is not like big one factory for for for toys I came to make and it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that dark area of the room which I which I say is to because they said they overlap them type and I believe that's where we overlap\nHim at fifth dimension and\nAh they were dragging him into that talks romance and I finally got him back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he said to me daddy why didn't demons come yeah I'm not really that fate of a person he said you know I don't understand ... why would even scot free and I was like boy I really don't know\nUh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are raised the same way like I said you know I've got a religion folk confirmed enough religion he was still but he dropped out and okay I have to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married what okay again I tell them you know\nYou got kids are never gave them a religion that anyone of your kids even ... one one prayer\nMaybe it's like I'm not\nWell I well I don't know maybe get a kick and yet but sometimes when you when you're passing to that fifth dimension you know to that where it overlaps somehow\nHold on John we're in a break but we'll come back and talk to\nThe website ... for

about your brother your your brother at the time what happened\nYeah fellow um just to recap uh is probably the only other time I've ever had an account with a devil that I Believe it you know yeah I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it\nAnd it wasn't really that person I mean after he left the religion like we talk and then he wanted to get married for ... and in every religion so uh you know I felt that made me but he said you know to me what you don't want to add on that huh\nThat made me but he said you know to me you know when I died on that hospitals that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically trying to get me back to life again with the ... and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and you could hear the alarms going off it was\nBut he was in that like that dimension that overlapping to mention I guess\nAnd he said there was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that oval laughing to mentioned and he said even came for him and he asked me what why the demons count me and I was like well I really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before before I had this half of Russian in my house but I wondered about a lot but he said uh like he's completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nReally scared the heck on moving\nA cat and he better believe it I mean to actually be dying dying and then\nLeave your body that's something you know he's going to remember his ya may still young guys only like forty years old he's got a lot of life ahead of him but he now has a very religious person\nBut uh he encountered this statement but the one that I encounter with a very different like I tell you to see and\nSays you know what was the first episode you John done ... demon showed up what\nYeah okay so let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that's on like an acre property\nHoboken argue\nAbout forty five of them that's not good ourself oh are you from Hoboken and no no she's not sure what ... oh yeah [laughter] well I was born in Brooklyn I thought that far from home but now I live in New Jersey\nSo oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped ... bartending at night and I love tending at night but uh and that but I stopped but I still know about those people and they still pray for those people and that's the big ...\nBig prerequisite of why I had to separate but now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine ... I have a very uh elaborate for life uh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires are not working at night and I miss those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house\nAnd it sounded like rip profit okay about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill\nYou come in to the house and yet the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage to send in the back door the as you come into the garage and then between the garage George and the basement is this big indoor and other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a\nLittle bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basements finished and uh I cut it in half and I had the apartment bills down near so my first wife that's all he wants to more space that he moved down there yeah you have your own interests\nYou pull your own words you want to say\nYes that was nice so then he goes to college any moves out thick and boy I watched that apartment and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he wants out of farming he ... he was in there he he was here this whole time so he's a U.S and when I had\nThe he was the smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind you I Believe that we have this big house and then like when he ... he he went to college he moved out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to set my own business as it comes back home because I mean we got it's a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean\nSo and I like having a a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when he was telling me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great orphans took it but anyway he's you know the whole time so that\nThe upstairs and so in the basement you come in that that I enjoy the steps that go up to the kitchen was a big kitchen the okay if you're in that case\nAnd you can almost hear that or an enclosed and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like I I go to the gym in the morning to meditate and in the afternoon and meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good as as a small little town that God gave me you know\nSo uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last cells that I felt will last those\nEvery day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nOh and then a bank\nYeah so then yeah I'm ... I'm sitting in the living room and that I enjoyed downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the\nIn the living room but I hear it slammed like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nIn you know somebody's open\nAbsolutely you in the house it twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know so I'm thinking to myself what what's out there but I don't think my wife could even if you came home and sleep like I don't even think of getting slammed that doing that hard and maybe my son can I don't know why he was doing it lets you had a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up\nTo me and my son can I don't know why he was doing that let's say at a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up I go to the kitchen I look downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime still talk to you so I go into ...\nI have a a surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors I look at the camera that faces that store in the back nobody went through the backdoor\nAnd or what you want you distinctly heard it all Oh absolutely slam yeah\nLike slant I didn't know at at the time 'cause we're going to discuss this creature was using its methodology on me and had a method it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passing through with now explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house he just on lock them and jumped out too so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I'd go say turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement\nThat looking everywhere you\nWent to and you you're pretty convinced you think somebody in the house don't you\nOh absolutely no actually\nBut I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel this menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an evil\nJust then I ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down the steps that look anyway somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer and my son's room under the bed in his closet you know and the furnished room I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling\n[noise] so I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broke in but I still have this really menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down\nAnd think about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something I really heavy because like I can hear when my wife comes up to ... hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to a hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down where you get something very silly crossing those steps\nAnd thinking to myself I just checked down here you know nothing was here\n... coming up this ...\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the steps like it up again I go over that I looked at nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you harmed her own armed and this time\nBut I have I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter]\nBut I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that look through the cat was if I were to fill us something then I I I didn't feel like a you know\nI don't think of a cat it was wondering if that had that feeling of something very menacing sinister and I think it is but could this possibly the but then I Try to shake it off because he like I'm just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to and what have you on where you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nWhen it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nYou we're running out of time so we're going to get through ... yeah\nOh ... or do we have another hour

I mean it is for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes I had these terrible Kansas\nAnd I would draw for them and they always they want to draw so that would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that the ... in in the lines are with the numbers more but some of them has it's terrible it's your Kansas say they would\nRule follow in your own coloring they withdrew their mouth is rule of law was in school you were at\nWell I was just it was yeah I was a special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay\nI but I Will be clean it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that doesn't mean anything to them er and er so anti but you know they learned a skill that they were never going to use it you know there was no really cure for them back to and even today just really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hands and the kids need to two hours for lunch for the teacher said with health feed them uh there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids that had in the ... in the room used to moving boxes long I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull\nUp to a warehouse and they put out there was a sign roles in the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't\n[noise] yeah so this is this still supply\nI enrolled us in my class I'd line up the kids I take to fill it can get a box but it on the island world he was flooded out to the next kid they ... they would open it up to fight it down to ... put something inside of down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time so George I know how to watching so I started bought him to the nightclubs and I believe this is\nA real prerequisite of what why this team and came to this house we're doing two jobs John\nYeah I mean I think a special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night out and look at all I Know a lot of\n... and the people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark sided thing because these people are like little wicked have looking for a cause\n... alcohol or drugs or commit adultery anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheist or they went to the coast a little bit\nMake Joyce I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behaviors enemy bobbing factor but joy over the years I noticed that a lot of these people died from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide chances and ... and I bought it with these people in the end and I knew them you know\nBut I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rider any way that\nI Would take him to do with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in a state that I thought nobody should die\nAnd we'll deal that's rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um you know I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing this book is going to teach you how it\nTeaches you the nose I self you know as I said to me is I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means knowing the truth about you you are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you might find it completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into the I think especially with the Boston that he worked right alongside and he was an atheist than there used to make fun of God used to make fun of you just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary and he smoked and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states\nCan't smoke so he\nCouldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from the school my school job in my night job or we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know he had this ... yeah it's about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months but that would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more vision of George because of the diagnosis he had\nHe died in such a terrible state he died in the state no one should die and uh I I felt like helpless form now in my religion George were told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky specific there's no one to pray for them\nSo that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky specific there's no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to hell that unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand that got left and our class that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was the free breakfast at of why this human creature this compelled to assess my house and I feel that mosaic fill your piece by piece right out of every single detail\nNo one can really will let me ask you this little John ... this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there absolutely\nNot absolutely not\nI've never had like a and I've never\nYou know I never had a ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on\nI never use ... or I never use tear a card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for a creature like this to come in and I don't think anybody does that because I now I think if you allow the street you to come in and he'll do harm I think if I met him to do is worse when you're the only other time it had\nNo there's no doubt if you view invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did in violence is absolutely\nNot I've learned a lot from it I learned that it even has a methodology will discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked at night so that's why I wrote that book anyhow that at best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown and that's that's the topic we don't touch so we don't last which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] so anyway\nPeople probably wind to was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the only other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we've had just a rare a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it kills them very early in the sixties had a heart attack and he died a think\nTank I rather was unfortunate for you to get it are you OK gets that she has me are you are right\nYeah what was the ... disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah or the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull you and I'll tell you\nSo poorly wakes up and he has the same symptoms my dad had chest fancy dolls nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital\nAnd at the hospital he dies on a hospital bed and when I went to visit them later on he says the Chinese you know and I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me said Johnny when I died on a hospital\nBed I left my body he said I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically and and they're trying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not uncommon eagles didn't\nYeah and uh alarms going off and he said that when I talk about that fifth\nFifth dimension that spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body they said in the hospital\nHe said to me ... ... ... and ... and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like\nBig ones like three foot four foot tall he came to me and it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that talk area of the room which I which I say is to because they have they overlap some time and I believe that's where we overlap him\nAt fifth dimension and ah they were dragging him into that talks Romesh they finally got him back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he said to me Johnny why didn't demons come yeah I'm not really that fate if a person he said you know I don't understand ... why would even call me and I was like boy I really don't know\nUh I don't know if anybody would no I Know that you know all of us are raised the same way like I said you know I've got a religion of confirmed enough religion\nHe was still but he dropped out and okay ... to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married to live but OK yeah again I tell them you know you got kids or you never gave them a religion can anyone of your kids even ... one one prayer maybe it's like I'm not\nWell I well I don't know maybe you get a big kick in your but sometimes when you when your passion to that fifth dimension you know that that we're at overlap somehow\nOn John we're in a break but we'll come back and talk [noise]\nThe ... voices reduce if you're ... when when joy or with your moon we'll just go to see 'em dot com on your iPhone or

brother at the time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only other time\nI've ever had an encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it\nAnd he wasn't really a bad person I mean he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived through the woman who didn't get married to an end to raise his case they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that may be but he said you know to me ... you know when I died on that hospitals that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically trying to get me back to life again with\nThe fifty ladies and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off it was\nBut he wasn't like that they mentioned that over laughing to mention I guess and he said it was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping to mention there he said David Kang for him and he asked me what why did he was ... man I was like for [laughter] I really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before uh before I had ever seen in my house\nBut ah I Wonder about it a lot but he's a a like a completely one hundred and eighty degrees turns man he's a very religious man now\nWe were you scared the heck on moving a cat and\nThe butter believe it I mean to actually be dying dying and then you know leave your body\nThat's something he if he's going to remember he's still young guys only like forty years always got a lot of life ahead of him but he now has a very religious person\nBut uh he encountered this statement but the one that I count that was a very different like I tell you that the ...\nYou know what was the first episode for you John ... demon showed up what\nYeah okay so let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that's on like an acre property\nFar how far Hoboken or you\nKnow pretty far from that's a good hour though oh are you from Hoboken\nAnd no no she's not sure what to do [laughter]\nOh yeah that I was born in Brooklyn I thought that far from home but now I live in New Jersey\nSo oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work\nWith those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped ... bartending at night and I love are tending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people and they still pray for those people and that's the big ...\nBig prerequisite of why I had the separation but now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine ... I have a very uh elaborate for life uh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires are not working at night and I miss those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house and it's on ... okay about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to the house and yet the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage is and it's a back door the come into the garage\nAnd then between the garage George and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basement finished and er I cut it in half and it had a apartment filth down near saw my first wife that's all he wants to more space that he moved down there yeah you have your own interests\nYou pull your aunts come and go as you want to say yes\nYes that was nice so then he goes to college any moves that second boy watched as part when you say he takes it he goes to college and moved out by third boy he wants out of farming he ... he was in there he he was here this whole time so he uh when I had\nTo he was the smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind you I Believe that we have this big house and then like when he ... he went to college he moved out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got it's a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so and I like having a ... a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when you tell me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then you've got a great often took it\nBut anyway he's here the whole time so that the upstairs and so in the basement you come in that that I enjoy just step back off to the kitchen was a big kitchen the okay if you're in that case and you can almost\nTalk to the kitchen was a big kitchen the okay if you're in that case\nAnd you can almost hear that door open and close and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like I\nI go to the gym in the morning then I meditate in the afternoon I meditate in at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good as as as a small little town that God gave me you know so uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last cells that I felt will last those\nEvery day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's\nFine oh and then a main yeah\nSo then yeah I'm sitting I'm sitting in the living room and that I endorse downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the living room\nBut I hear it's slam like it never was lamb before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at\nTwenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking to myself what was it was I don't think my wife could even if you came home and sleep like I don't even think you're getting slammed that do it that hard\nAnd maybe my son's cat and I don't know why he would do it unless you had a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up I go to the kitchen I look downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime still\nTalk to you so I go into ... and I have a a surveillance system here I said look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors I look at the camera their faces that store in the back nobody went through that fact door\n... and or what you want your distinctly heard it all\nOh absolutely slam no like slant\nI didn't know at at the time 'cause we're going to discuss this creature was using his methodology on me and had a message wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call it wasn't passing through with now explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house he is on lock them and jumped out too so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I'd go turn the lights on in the basement I go down to the basement and it's not looking everywhere you\nWent to and you you're pretty convinced you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely no\nActually but I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel this menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an evil\nJust then I ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look under the steps that look anyway somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer and my son's room under the bed in his closet you know and the furnished room I look I look at my frantic look and I still have this horrible feeling\n[laughter] so I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came in nobody broken but I still have this really menacing since the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something I really heavy because like I can hear when\nMy wife comes up to seven hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down like where I guess something very silly\nCrushing those steps and thinking to myself I just shut down you know nothing was here\n... coming up to ... [noise]\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the stuff I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you armed or on armed at this time\nI I have I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter] but I but I didn't see\nAnything so you know what I mean I looked at the cameras that look through the cameras if I ever saw something then I I I didn't feel like a you know and I don't think I I kinda was wondering because I had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd I think it is but could this possibly the but then I tried to shake it off to us because he like I've just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to want to you on where you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nOr when it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nYou we're running out of time so we're going to get to really you know\nOh ... or do we have another hour though you know we're taking calls and\nSo okay so my wife comes home he said is this the first thing she says to me she comes in is like a", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "04"}
