missions finance mine the asteroids if something though for the future there are\nAnd he joins mine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable and um once our space a capabilities advanced a bit more that will become a possible thing to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your guest's name Robert Robert\nRobert a great question to go um\nOh girl we take 'em off here [noise] there's sort of speculative reversed is um\nYou know anything about ... years ago the ... ... ... and probably gravity back in the sixties and ...\n... you know anything of the ... reversal that being able to generate order for us for gravity and secondly you do anything about electrical ... from the\nAh let me or those three questions we've got one more Robert ... one more okay one more\nYeah the third one is um we're gonna be advisable to design a space station like a ... thing to test I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just to run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one in Lear jets and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to creating artificial gravity you spend the space craft\nCrates and typical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you get with um\nZero gravity for longer belongs to the long time so yeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you\nKnow ... not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving it around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and see all gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo roller will do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and I'm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited\nAnd what that means is that electrical pulse and systems are kinda like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week\nI'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town but if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that when all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um you know a week later you're going sixty miles an hour and you've reached\nA the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars\nAnd actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit\nIf because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you're going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would um be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did uh the science on Mars is far more profound\nDead or the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and bars has gotten much more resources I mean if you compare marched to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to green [noise] you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch agreement long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars\nWell then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with it go to them don't come up with\nSome other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to them and now\nI can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already wherever we're at the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions and the space uh when we send out these probes are what you are or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even\nOpen space as opposed to the planet and\nWould it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury or what some sort of probes in case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined what CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars uh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come to Mars\nWhat type of person probably looking for all right\nLet me take the questions one of the time of the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun is called uh and uh\nIf you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuits are white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up your questions there and they're interested in what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back

eight five five nine for nine seven two three four\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research\nOut there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans mean you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions um there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorized these environmentally sensitive people\nUm and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have ... you know long standing allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just\nAn overt sensitivity to light sound like you're a city and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk\nOr they may be me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place they all get ashes [laughter] so he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences and the general population\nUm there's those higher it's a really high number and what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's ex federal magnetic field more than the general population in other words they have a veteran Tana or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment the tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also sign saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nSome of these people brand and realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things I mean did they know they get it\nI I think they do it in and when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and let you find is\nYou know not only are do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetic so their mom to with her dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on\nSo this is something kind of like most you know genetic diseases or or whatnot this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people you know\nLike I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or so these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows my criticism them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of\n... Leon donor because it's television and you know they don't want to do this three minute one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility some ...\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because it implies that\nEither people are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine no you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot grows too few goes to more than others but what about the goes good cells are there some does that come back more often than others\nOr because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really\nI guess which one is stronger in ... when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up goes way encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably some she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these grossly things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive person\nUm they're going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes to encounter the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day\nHowever one location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of ghostly phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active\nA lot of goes the phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it but then you start asking yourself why why that place in wide eyed the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon ... out of the other locations\nYou know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here one\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration as you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable of that line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point\nBut the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me early\nYeah really is I remember when my dad brought home a better Tv antenna\nAnd it was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little uh knob on it and you click and to broaden the signals better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brenda\n[laughter] and I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you do or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I'm I get that question\nA lot though the the theme of questions seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's\nGreat uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good with the bad weather the positive with that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic mhm\nDemonic team as more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a a scientific perspective\nSo usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious felt to it um that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um so I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of thing\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies ... dot com of course linked

people with some case studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites what do you have\nA first ever really account that I go over I'm the first one is actually\nSo I have several real life accounts that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween is approaching I'll I'll I'll go with this one\nPerson um trigger [laughter]\nMy wife had passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approached I was putting up decorations as the kids in a neighborhood usually love trick or treating my wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we had places Plaskin ... plastic pumpkin and our window every Halloween\nI searched house for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my faith and the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf\nSo this\nThis is a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting ghost interacting with us so in this case you know the ghost during his ghostly encounter the ghost had a conscience\nAnd she was actually giving information that the husband wanted\nSo they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness\nUm they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on that are on the twenty fifth the mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction um is sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like um the ... in intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigated the paranormal\nWho's Europe pecking order on the other side brand in in in your opinion I'm almost forty I mean who sends to go back to do what it does do it on its own or some organization ... do we know usually\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness\nSo you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um\nAre ... after we die you know what happens to that right or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just seems to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says you but when you look at things\nIf consciousness survive death and it goes in and it continues to exist it's it could maybe really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like ... example with a husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path loved one and then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs really important or Michael pursing or who recently passed away but it was a neuropsychologist basically said and he did all the the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln civilian a kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he was great experiences happen\nWhat do you say the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or ... or ...\nYeah unfortunately I think\nYou know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of say jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy\nI'm so ... you know what I usually tell people who ... skeptics or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen\nYou know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and um you know you see at all\nI mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments on med floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments him over the course of time you\nI've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who are genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience that's huge\nYeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or your this or that or your unstable or you're losing eating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nBut listen I in my professional opinion lotteries goes encounters are the the there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism is healthy as long as a truce skeptic has an open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right because you can just\nIn golf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes there everything is it goes\nIt's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take those side you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read that believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's\nYou know what's fraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the central when it comes to being involved in the paranoia\nFor I'm pretty much a majority of my life what change do you know I I\nWhen people would tell me and I was really interested in Paris college like I said before but I never had an experience\nSo I always kind of thought well these people who are having experiences maybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people would tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and as they are talking I wasn't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and you know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious\nShow drags stuff I'm Harold facts numbers life feels\n...\nYes exactly a near death experiences all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down the rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle man it and then you kinda go ... wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then\nYou know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year um I I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which the typically give credence to the idea that philosophy and ESPN aside phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if this is saying this and these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part a thing\nHe was

know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for that goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe don't teach them Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others I've seen the film of the baby ... chicks being fed by humans with hand puppets

appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a a Kurd would end me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not close by definition but\nJust kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that\nLake with a window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage can't imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached immediately like a husband who was white that\nHe would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars\nOthers radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience has happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it\n... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and these sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life um\nSo we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes in with sort of\nAncestral believes that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of\nVision and stories and things like that\nBut I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes there out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes religion kind of changed your views about these operations ghost donors\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes are using it basically changes our perception of an experience so\nYou know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not\nThe religious person might perceive that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an angel or I'm a of of a sign from from God are assigned from a deceased person that they love\n'em right as a person who doesn't have that religious tell to it my experiences as simply you know an experience or or or um a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon um and that's how we talked about before\nOf an eye on 'em and that's how we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bounce spirits everything is that are found spirit [noise] ah so I think perception religion or they play a huge part how we perceive a ghost encountered a paranormal phenomena\nHave you ever

moment here\nShelly in North Dakota has the situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation Shelley how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's ... she's not there anymore cable I get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that you know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment to to communicate so that's like phones hacked\nEmails these types of things um you know typically people will report\nThey'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich he encompasses a great he he's less a bunch of these um phenomenon\nThat are happening and then there's phantom menace messages which has recently came out as well which goes over this is well it's hard to really know that to me I mean listen this is the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electric off of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so\nYou know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure\nUh but anytime we talked about this from numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon ...\nAh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening or it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point goats are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable will which is essentially it's everything that the scientific method hates 'em for these things are are tough and and that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know is that a cop out though to be just to say that\nAh I think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say the person's misunderstanding or it's fried earth over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's\nUm but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you gotta ... it's about collecting data about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods um you know if the\nJim similar methods um you know\nIf sample sizes huge in academia and was skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know\nThree hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variables are um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people were just adamant believers there's\nThere's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom drunk driving in ... I'm going\nBy how are ya great thank you\nI Want to talk to you guys have a long time listener first time caller so there wouldn't be a little bit short story\nI Am a back in Nineteen Seventy four nights five I was ten or eleven years old we get New York's small house and upstate\nAnd I woke up and I don't know why but there was a man standing there and he was a goes with the thing that she didn't even hear the Spanish Military uniform\nAnd I'll never forget it I close my eyes open it back up at me like the ... couple of times myself we weren't studying spoiled or anything like that grows really are open them up and he was right in my face\nAnd then I close my eyes and he was standing back against the wall Street Journal look if you can just smiled but he was funny and I just walk through the wall\nWhoa did the uniform looked like it might have been from the Eighteen hundreds or something like that some\nEarly night he ... he had the rump both on the shoulders and the ...

she's got a PHD in nuclear engineering as well noted author one of his books\nHow to live on Mars and we're going to talk about all things space and the next couple of hours Robert welcome back\nMy friend and for me I always a pleasure have you been a pretty good pretty good at keeping to think what are we going to Mars [noise] um at this point it looks like\nWhat are we going to march\n[noise] um at this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sex is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be a fully reusable a to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully usable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars\nUh and if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must be ... next to the edge of the ice\nYou know I'm very got\nUh the blue origin company by a led by ... base owes the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so ah we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions and its space astronomy missions uh ... their work in that field is ethic but uh the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it isn't that NASA is going to like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA is a human spaceflight program as dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster if NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm to have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago or a high level NASA official got actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter] what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die off so they can help people that he did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who don't that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the move 'em and I mean here's this thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is gonna be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building\nAnd you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill pass on that had to deal and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you probably saw me what you buy the ... you probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land then with this ... ...\nYou know with measles doing what he's doing well in a space acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching national just kinda and not do much anymore with manned space flights in and say it's disappointing Robert really is\nIt is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nAnd act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan a chaos\nAnd the the the you know so\nThere it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while would come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is\nYou know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping ... Stein would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons\nA at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night uh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a you off or something like that but it was big tech you alert to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because shore we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that Musk has done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram traumatic\nIt's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compare to 'em what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone a it was accepting would be normal and\nThis thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space\nAnd a number of other advanced fields that people thought were helpless\nUh so okay Bezos has his own money's got large and but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this has just never going to happen they keep\nOn saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours [noise] lacks the coast to coast they\nAlways on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized rule users just point your iPhone or Android rose or to go to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\n[laughter] an unusual guy um do you like him he\nYeah although we can be a difficult at times uh I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is um [noise]\nUh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is is okay on the one side he well he is very driven it's very hard working uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do something great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what it's about a\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for [noise]\nTo do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants to eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa he can be selfish he he um and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people are\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him back to um didn't come off so well why keep getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [noise] um\n\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great the do you go about\nIt it's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology might be well he had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you\nKnow uh uh when he gives in that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's must to AT T and um and and and so but really um\n[noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must because the hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person I'm\nA ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that as a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you go from the ... results Robert Well Jeff these those as much calmer I'm much more laid back\nUm I don't know these shows I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect that a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances\nAnd thus far um they're winning 'em but it's certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard bees owes the model of this company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why a limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space sex and the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military\nMeans so just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time I'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less\nUh because\nUh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's ...\nIt was like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March march what what's going on with some of the latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European book all these experiments\nOr ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar than his radar that can look through the ground and see what's underground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth\nAre still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars would have retreated into that ground water and be there still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it is as far south is thirty eight ... a a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which by the way the same latitude a San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that you know life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's ... there there's two different versions of it\nOne is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay 'cause\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past\nWell if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that dinosaur bones don't prove that there were dinosaurs because God could have put the dinosaur bones in the ground and\nYou've only cars

next couple of hours Robert welcome back my friend\nThanks for inviting me always a pleasure hobby ban I'm pretty good pretty good at keeping ... what are we going to Mars\n[noise] um at this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space access pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be fully be usable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully be usable or that will get\nEquivalent to a Saturn five but fully usable or that will give us the capability to go to\nMars uh and if they should um\nYou know ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must be ... next to the edge of the ice is um they're got\nUh the blue origin company by a lead by Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so ah we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now [noise]\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions and space astronomy missions uh their work in that field is ethic but ah the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like speeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA is a human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster if NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program I mean that storm to have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago or a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem [laughter]\nWhat what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got and maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who don't that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean let let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the\nHere's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal\nI Want to read you an office in Saskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill pass on that\nHad to deal and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you probably filming what you buy the swamp lend you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land than with this ...\nYou know with measles doing what he's doing fell in ... it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights in it's disappointing Robert really is\nIt is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects and and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so\nThere it is but uh I got to tell you you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping Brian and Stein would do that but he didn't he just went along\nLand on the mood I was hoping brightest spine would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons a at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and\nHalf the people who are looking into the skies that night uh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a U.S for something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we\nStarted the space age with expendable rockets and you figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be reusable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nDramatic it's dramatic it's spectacular and it was done on a shoestring compared to [noise]\nUm what a NASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time that anyone a it was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people were hopeless uh so okay Bezos has his own money's got large in but we now have three small launch companies\nA firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars a two to field a small launch systems\nAnd it even goes beyond the the us space\nIndustry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents oh this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years\nAnd but people than say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crock pot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with a rubber stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours ... coast to coast\nThey are always on your own you'll be happy to know the ... website is now optimized grew mobile users just point your iPhone or Android ... to ... dot com and enjoy [noise]\nYeah although we can be a difficult at times I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is um [noise]\nUm okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is is okay on the one side he well he is very driven it's very hard working uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh [noise]\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great he wants he turn all Henri for doing great so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish and he he um and he's certainly um\n\nI'm not above using people uh [noise] and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so\nAnd land um that that's the other side of it so you're a ... that you know there is um\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's ... it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great\nTeaches you go about that it's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the we had\nThis is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth\nYou know uh uh when he gives that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to define the French because he he even though I mean the odds are against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's mosque to a tea and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise] you know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must cause a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person I'm\nA ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who goes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you can just results Robert Well Jeff these those as much calmer a much more laid back\nUm I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh\nAnd if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning 'em but it's certainly a there they've pushed very hard bees owes the model of this company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush the cells strength and his weakness\nIs that he has unlimited funds now why ... limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is up but\nThe and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time\nAnd that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair\nUm blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money okay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper across people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less\nUh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still and whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in March march what what's going on with some of the latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nYeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European but all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and its radar that can look through the ground and see what's on the ground and um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found\nRadar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment\nUm it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water is is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and\nIf there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into that ground water and be there still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which find ways to same latitude a San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers\nSan Francisco and Denver and you know a Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are\nAnd what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get out with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people just drink some people say that your new life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um\nI think so there's there's ... there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay because that means you\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean the ... because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if how do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did\nWell for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower this all this stuff that they built in the past\nWell if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of it\nAnd I mean to to to say that fossils of life on Mars don't prove that the life you find there was there before is like the people who say that\nPrivate landowners to protect wildlife to preserve natural habitat to learn more work with the humane society wildlife land

do you think of the Japanese plans the mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um\nFuturistic at this point uh I think though that if we

missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because\nThe mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now

more ah that will become a possible thing to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your your guess is Robert\nRobert Robert are great questions\nOf well I'm\nA girl we take 'em off here [noise] they're sort of speculative\nReversed is um\nKnow anything about ... years ago that we're just talking about anti gravity back in the sixties and ...\n... you know anything is possible reversal being able to generate orders for gravity and uh\nBeing able to generate artificial gravity and secondly you know anything about electrical record ... from the\nUh I mean that those three questions and you got one more Robert Young one more okay one more\nYear the third one is um we're gonna be advisable to design a space station like a memorial type thing to to um oh human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nRight Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the spacecraft\nCrates and typical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent\nThe deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with 'em in zero gravity long\nBelongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving it around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but\nIf you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition no role liberal do anything for it\nRight and then the the the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount of electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using\nA electrical electromagnetic forces to accelerate upper towns to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric throughout the year that you can with the chemicals roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town but if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached\nA the east coast and now you can go driving around the world 'cause your car can drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars\nAnd actually takes longer to get there with electric

propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would uh be cost\nYou know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did uh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe\nAnd Mars has got much more resources to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to green you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't the place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars\nWell then they say well then we'll go to the moon well what I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with the go to the moon don't come off with some other thing that's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nGo to the moon because if we go to them in fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nHow can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber wears the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were

send out these probes are what you are or what would you be dealing with extreme heat even\nSpace as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go through mercury though with some sort of probes and case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined what CEO to increase was\nUh in other words what the spin off of dealing with what's screams heat and space help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars [noise] uh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship them to Mars\nWhat type of person always looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one time or the first question it hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you are a far away from the sun it's called uh and uh\nIf you're in earth orbit kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can ... the reason why spacesuit so why is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kinda have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back will let them

N. G. L. dot com like international geo water international\nAnd the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet\nThe water comes from them back well below that whatever you've got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen auction and make its way to the surface and moved back\nIn areas of open is worthy is the structure that happens quite often and on Mars the same effect is there in fact the largest volcano in the solar system of the Olympics moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet tall just ... digits\nThere was a cold beer on top and that's what ... provide Scott city or lava flows to happen\nSo that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers and there's probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either\nOrganisms flew here from you know chopped up media writes a slow off the planet or or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skate think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true or not civilizations but a microbes on on me\nAh not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one of two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that then you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit find meteors knocking chunks offsetting I'm flying and hitting the earth were hit by Mars meteorites all the time I'm\nIf life could evolve quickly\nOut of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did so life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that it came from Mars\nThe the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organism simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated\nThey have this whole shirt DNA in are in a whole alphabet for

not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this\nHad been worked out so uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars in interstellar space\nI just lost his

News dot com where you can\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nSensitivity alright and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans may and you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have ... you know long standing allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just an\nOvert sensitivity to light found my city and smells more than\nMaybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place or get ashes [laughter] so he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population um there's those higher it's a really high number\nAnd what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's act federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a veteran Tana or biological radio and\nThe electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios and they're picking up on things in it and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real\nI think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity so there's science\nBehind it and then there's also signed saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nDo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then they're ... and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most\nYou know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity a so these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively to that does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows my criticism them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of goes down\nBecause of television and you know they don't want to do this three minute one hour program and not have anything happen so looks like they create these things and I think that kinda hurts the credibility ...\nYeah I think I think it it it really does too because it implies that\nEither people are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud and um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine no you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have one experience\nIt's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location 'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried type of\nThing should we we talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot coast to coast more than others but what about the ghost cells are there some does that come back more often than others um because they have an ability to do that\nUm I think it's really I\nWhich one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes\nStronger when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter of a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really sense\nI mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably some she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from radio station\n... isn't it much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive person\nUm they're going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um so I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes for encounter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however\nOne location I'm picking up a lot of\nUm having a lot of ghostly phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it but then you start asking yourself why why that place and and why not the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon\n... out of the other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable of that line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric\nA consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me early\nYeah it really is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV [laughter] I don't know that was the kind that didn't just move with a remedy huge but it had like a little uh knob on it then you click\nAnd it brought into signal better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing times change brand\n[laughter] and I remember those too [laughter]\nYou know or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and\nI'm I get that question of well a lot though the the theme of questions seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the\nGood with the bad weather the positive with that this was at that and I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic mhm demonic and theme\nIs more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a a scientific perspective\nSo usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um so I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards the more demonic part of thing\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy it but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on

you you interviewed a number of people with some peace studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites would yeah\nSure sure uh so I have several real life accounts that I go over I'm the first one is actually because Halloween is approaching I'll I'll I'll go with this one\nPerfect um trigger [laughter]\nMy wife had passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house of myself\nAs Halloween approached I was putting up decorations of the kids in the neighborhood usually a lot of trick or treating my wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we have places plastic ... plastic pumpkin and our window every Halloween\nI searched house for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered check behind the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my face as the\nPlastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf so\nThis is a a great example of a you mentioned it before and intelligent haunting goes interacting with us\nSo in this case you know the ghost during his ... and counter the ghost had a conscious\nAnd she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness\nUm they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on that are on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction um it's sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like I'm the editor in intelligence the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigated the paranormal\nIs Europe pecking order on the other side Brandon in in your opinion on what's already I mean who sends the goes back to do what it does does it do it on its own or is there some organization that's involved in doing that on usually\nI'm a strong believer in in consciousness\nSo you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um after we die you know what happens to that\nRight or some people will say that we're just computers and when we die everything of who we are memories are ... ... it just seems to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream science says view but when you look at things\nIf consciousness survive death and it goes in it and it continues to exist it's it could maybe it really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed\nMaybe like ... example with a husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past wife\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really needs something and then they sort of resonate with the consciousness of of a path love one and then these experience maybe happen\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that that we don't know about and the consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment\nIs is really important uh Michael pursing or who recently passed away but it was a narrow psychologist basically said and he did all of the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist at it um which means we\nEver lived their consciousness to exist in it um which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln civility the kids\nIt's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he is great experiences happen\nWhen you say the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have the owners are mentally unstable or something even worse ...\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you a ghostly encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of say jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy\nUm so you you know what I usually tell people who who skeptics or or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen\nYou know in in my experience it's all I Do all day is diagnosed mental health and and um you\nKnow you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments unmet floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who are genuine\nAnd had a subjective paranormal experience that's huge\nYeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or this or your dad or your unstable or you're losing aiding or you're\nDrinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is but listen I in my professional opinion lotteries goes encounters are the the they're genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism healthy as long as a true skeptic has an open mind\nMhm exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic right because\nYou can just engulf yourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes through everything is it goes\nIt's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take those side you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read the believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's\nYou know what's\nFraud are fake or just people being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part of the central when it comes

know I'm going to start listening and I started listening and I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious drags stuff I'm ... and Harold ... life feels\n...\nYes exactly a near death experiences\nAll this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down that rabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle man and then you kinda go ... wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then\nYou know as far as ... the and things like that I mean the research on that is growing every year\nUm I I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that collapse of the N E S P and the side phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if all this is saying this and these ghostly encounters could be possible as well and that's kind of what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part of thing\nHe was another one of your favorite ... orange\nOr I I got a lot of them so uh [noise]\nWe'll go with will go with one that's been pretty popular here recently has
