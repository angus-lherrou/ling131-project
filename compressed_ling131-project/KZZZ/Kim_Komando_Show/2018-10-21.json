patient can choose to make sure the weddings right at the camera looks good and we should look good on camera before she jumps in and starts talking to a patient\nYeah 'cause you don't want to look bad no no you have to look you know body you have to look hot\n[laughter] yes yes uh this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop or even my eye pad and iPhone right\nIn Chicago you have sunny days you have cloudy days right yes and you have cold winter days I've been there like a ... so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a ring light I don't know if you've heard of it is and it's a it is a rank and\nUh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portraits that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a Web cam is that you have a tendency to be washed out okay\nWith the green light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I look better and her dark restaurant\nNot not so much in K now when you're spaces illuminated what's in the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall\nMeaning I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them I Want to see\nAll your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'd like to be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as that person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have it's like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that factory right okay so we clean all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button this but it's gonna be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds and\nThen you don't have to worry about just taking a picture so if you can record some video of herself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize funny is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know race or 'cause there's a whole side of I mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors my\nI hear a lot of the bad stories but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality comes through have you ever done this before\nAre only and Web but not actually as a patient doctor thing\nThis is so cool I'm so excited for you um the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes a\nTotal difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this rating light and again thank you for your call [noise]\nHey speaking out let's talk about Sarah works written leave like many of us she might suffer from muscle cramps in your legs and also in your

reputation is always on the line and that's where the Dow small business technology advisors comment reliable del PCs with intel core processors are rock solid\nI understand but that's not their role at\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want\nTo split it bad but at ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that\nBut you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the start\nGoing there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent point eight hundred dollars or something in common they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right [noise] one was once and for all you Android people and the other ones had for\nAll your iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android\nOne didn't have anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks chip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this when this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we'd go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total\nAnd it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars sounds like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you\nYeah and you know ... and it tore us for that and also overreach because they'll say like price things search okay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may be\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life\nI actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll\nActually add more like it's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday\nAnd it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nSo you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars hey and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra four or five\nI Wonder what I mean the research got to be out there that this worked otherwise the absolute are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know let's remember they're making a percentage of the total even I tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that tone and thinking about that so they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the temple ... dollars no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom\nLine transaction then you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he goes I'm On I'm Still not done well I'll just hard it is hard and you know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are there is no maybe about uh that I think that you know but I Am but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin [laughter] so here's ten percent ... instead of having an African let me just use the cash that you're expecting me to like my ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years epson printers may have earned my truck which is why I'm uncommitted user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical Epps an ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic\nWireless all in one\nCorner love this friend is my corner of choice or for a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate buying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway golden no it's colored IQ\nBut the ... and ... forty seven fifty cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG right in the box that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that's now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's ... do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printer ink tank ... seconds\nThe ego taken the compact space saving printer that is truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash eco tank can that's ...

it for another hour of America's biggest weekend radio show now broadcast over a foreigner type stations from coast to coast and you can find us around the world on the American forces\nNetwork radio loved that what that means is a hundred and Seventy seven different countries and every ship it the gifts that came commando showed truly yours source for\nEverything digital like I like to say because after all I'm Kim commando America's ... digital got us here with you once again and the phone lines are open\nI'm sure you have at least a few questions on something digital I can lend a hand to and that number is one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us once again that number's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four\nAnd before we get back to all of your phone calls they showed some more interesting items that crossed my desk and screen that you just need to know about first which\nIs one of these ideas that popped up and I'm telling ya I should've thought of this this is a product\nThat if I ever wanted to create a product it satisfy that need as private it's secure I think it's too pricey right now but let me tell you a little bit about it [noise]\nThe idea of a whole personal email server it kinda got a bad rap with Hillary Clinton and her emails and that whole fiasco\nBut the whole idea is that your email is safe it's not handled in the cloud you actually have a physical drive now setting up an email server used to mean calling the nerds calling them again when you need to change up some settings and calling them again what had just\nDied because it would happen but there's a new product called hell and your emails no\nLonger floating in the clouds and where it's actually physically in your home the server like I mentioned it expensive five hundred bucks to buy the size of a book\nAnd has a hundred and twenty a gigs and storage of trade and go to five terabytes there is no fan passively clued cold rather um it has its security care physical key because also the email it's encrypted so it's not just five hundred bucks and there was a hundred dollar a year subscription\nFee and if you think about it this way there's other downsides and one of them primarily is that you're not going to have all the latest feature stand Gmail and auto complete and you know tab auto it's going to fill out all the sensors for you but it's a product that does have an extra does have a need\nAnd when the price come down and I think it's probably worth all taken a look at\nAnd other new products we're talking about smart home technology yeah was specifically ever you ever thought about how your couch its into your home\nCasper dot com terms and conditions apply\nRight now Doctors Without borders medical teams are operating

which is what I have and also now the ex are so is the acts are really truly worth the money\nIt's actually cheap seven hundred and forty nine dollars I Know you're you're saying Kim seven hundred and forty nine dollars is really expensive for a phone well not when you compare it to like eleven hundred for the latest iPhone\nAnyway just few last week talking more about that but I'd really love to hear from you that show one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again as a way to join us\nAnd then there's Andrew been skiing the Kim commando show man cave whole low there Andrew Kim\nWe're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania ... springs\nGrowth that sounds like a nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible play ... I live in spring grows right next to the garbage\nTown Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas and she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless confusing moral and she has it for ...\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to uses the rising towers so she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same kind of action and then she went what if\nWhat if it's worth it if it's where I Need to call him and it's so frustrating though isn't it\nI mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now if\nA lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial you're I think I'm just to buy yeah you're right on the U.S is that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it doesn't have say a fiber optic next\nI mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedrooms and a fiber connection so that this way you don't have to worry about what's going on so so care and you don't have all bars in all places that's\nWhat I'm hearing that is correct and there's no way that you want to move to the big city ah no no we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained of arise and what did they say [noise]\nUm they really can't get many answer I've been I've been within twenty twelve okay\nBut the past month is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast\nFor my Internet and income can't say well we also have mobile and so I thought well that might be a great service but I'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same rising powers and would switch between\nBreaking towers and Comcast hot spots\nSo I don't know like we have\nI I don't I don't know if I'd Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise]\nYou know what you okay ... you know which you could possibly get and I don't know for a variety in the you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs the you may be able to get a little what's called a ... self or your house and so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went about the Comcast is that\nIs Comcast is using other ... cells to increase your reception and you're in bars I don't know if I like that either\nUm so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of Microsoft or something that you can I can put inside my house that will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest may so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers in that even though like for rising and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technology so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense okay I'm In there\nI'm cast with and say you know ... which frequency is Comcast on a tower and how does that compare of arrived and so that this is not that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different enough that one service might be better\nAnd I and Comcast senses the cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee\nAnd it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking to an for gee you're talking about one gig abet a per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple created this and so you know couple of solutions that she might wanna try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close to ... to uh [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage made very right the truth I could be you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is have Comcast turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works\nExplained to them I don't want to sign up for a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or she would I'm getting and you don't let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so again you might have to escalate it's a little\nBit up higher but it's definitely something\nThat you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation\nAnd Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary what's\nGoing on [noise] are you doing on looking or an app that I can secure released on the money to a private party\nUm [noise] I was in a small car accident and rather than go through the insurance on the ... center it's a song it's a friend of mine\nWho like to take care of it personally sure I'm I'm just flipping gr secure at that I can send her um payments or I'm not not something we all use all the time that\nSomething that can periodicals down here in the ... uh\nUh you know a couple of ways you can do it you know [noise]\nJust just a rule of thumb is when you're sending money to friends be you know we have to be really careful make sure that you have everything done correctly because they don't issue refunds okay\nA couple of options you've have Google Wallet you'll have pay pal and one of the most popular ones out there now is something called the ... and all of them charged two point nine percent as far as to make this wire transfer a busy exceptional pay pal they charged two point nine percent plus thirty cents\nBut if you're looking for a safe secure way you don't want to give out your checks or maybe you don't even have a bank account anymore\nAnd that you want to take a look at as I mentioned Google Wallet probably pay pal is the one that's most commonly used then ... it seems to be getting a lot of traction though as time goes on Gary thank you for calling stay right where you are we have our money to coming up and more of your phone calls that you don't want to miss here on the ... commando show [noise]\nOh\nNumber on merit digital cameras on them\n\nOver the years I've tried and tested every way that average people can and should back of the debt on their computers I'll tell you that I drive simply the best climbed back upstairs there is for big reasons why\nFirst it's the easiest to use I back up everything all my computers smartphones I passed tablets everything to one single I drive a ... second it's the most secure with I drive snapshots I'll never lose even a single bite of data never pay a penny because of ransomware\nEvent you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have in the next year hop okay\nAnd then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you want to certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lives for that if you had certain cameras she could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so once you once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby you start thinking about OK\nWhat more can I add to that right\nYeah so I'm sort of like\nKnow so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's the only\nThere are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome luggage yeah then it might be worth it okay so when you start looking at different products the smart things though this is where it gets confusing is that you've got the wave in the bay and those are different standards\nAre well and that works with the smartest things next to the uh everything works like um I have a a train air conditioner that I can control remotely you know on the next year or so so so that's what I'm trying to it so I'm trying to expand your horizons so once we have the hub what else can we do at that\nLaw took things yeah it's exciting I mean it's really cool to doctors all states with the holograms turning around\nAnd her don't you think that you and I would I be excellent at doing like a theatre version of the came commando show absolutely agree making a musical\nWell I don't know I can think commando them he was one that I don't [laughter]\nI don't think we'd go past one no I mean justice so anyway popular demand anyone that I don't have a say in ... and great bend Kansas that was we didn't even make into like Lincoln Broadway in ... that was it that's awful awful awful awful\nSays runs right or the ... it's more intimate that well that's\nAll right so the next few systems in cars set you back eight dollars and Ninety nine cents a month\nAll right okay that's it not a big deal so I'll take a look at the the the the ... legs since and connect OK okay the next ... about sixty bucks the lock is going to set you back a hundred and fifty and then you're looking at say just for gay those ten bucks a month and\nThen it allows you to program all those codes get reports whose common and what's going on with that and then if you could set up for twenty four hours and then if somebody does or do you think something was wrong you can just kill that code and killed it automatically\nThere's no delay you can also un slit yeah you can set up a code really ... you\nKnow if you're if you're doing anything remotely a really makes sense that you start looking at smart stuff an order to be notified and get alerts and things like that hey Charlie thank you for your call and keep us posted on what's going on in great bend and how that locks working out for you\nAll right speaking of homes will talk a little bit
