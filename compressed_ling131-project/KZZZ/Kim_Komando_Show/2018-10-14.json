... when I say Seventy are no\n\nTeam pretty rough for God Andrew ... so Eric\nYes or he wants to be able to in non immensely put photos on the Internet\nAnd when someone normally calls that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know one 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or sharing yeah it sounds like something shady yes but he has good reason he has to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like when he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication from\nAn interesting question yeah that is because it's so so Eric he wanted the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yes that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] you know we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for five or wow okay\nAnd this year the father the biologic father passed away so um we had some feelers out for people who who have this didn't contact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could honestly present them pictures that they could see but I also don't want us to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to say I want to be able to target who can say that\nI get that I get that you know first of all what big heart than you and your wife must have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nRight now they're seven eight ten and eleven\nWow okay it's a full household [laughter] it's a full house for other kids of our own so loud that we have a [laughter] that's awesome that's awesome uh a couple of thoughts come into\nMind or of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there is no identifiable characteristics you know\n... and so forth\nYeah I Would take out all the all the medical data and the E. X. I. F. data and you're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I put down that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera or just on Google Map\nAnd so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thought she might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you have the school photos number one\nUh you know put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call\nIs that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shut her fly okay shutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums that a particular website if he well that contains all the photos and so if they\nI'm fine and then sign up for an account and again years going to be some options when you do this that you really looking for in your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that addressed that they'll be able to access\nAll those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there's no identical characteristics with kids\nAs far as any type of school logos or anything else that might show where they were actually physically located in any of those shops are of course you can always use any photo editing program which is kind of stuff in the back at\nAll right let's talk about one of our great sponsors

became commando show\nAnd the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way to join us once again that toll free number is one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four\nAnd before we go back to all of your fantastic phone calls this show us some more interesting items that car across my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning weak passwords that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats and routers garage doors the smart light bulbs the smart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack\nPasswords for example many routers and Web cams have a default admin password like admitting or password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always change the default pass for\nMaking something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers and scammers alright so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nThat said week default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is that most of those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China\nSo the new law is going to require manufacturers to said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place that forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they explode the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google Google has its own social media site called Google Plus they announced between twenty Fifteen and Marshall twenty Eighteen\nAll right so we started talking about smart TV [noise] the thing that makes the TV smart is that what it connects up to the Internet\nWell once you can make something up to the Internet guess what else can happen yeah the hackers in scammers and the bad things can go on well this past week a big security alert for certain brand of television that they had to listen they had to they had to run down and install these firmer updates but the problem is that\nThey want you to install the former update so if you don't know about this update then you're sitting there just fat dumb unhappy watching TV and ... can be doing whatever they want getting onto your TV and then on to the network so that's coming up and just a few moments but first\nThe phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again in the way to join us and as always there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commandos show man gave up before we talk about the call yes\nThat are coming in here it's third our that this weekend show\nUm I\nAm still wearing my apple watch no you might recall it was probably what would that eight or nine months ago when I was really excited about having an apple watch and you got for three right I had a serious threat and you know both you and Mike or like my brother's right okay so you\nSee me embrace technology and throw it away\nOver the years so I was really super excited about having an apple watch and the first time I ward YouTube took that\nHow long were you aware of what we had the over under going yeah yeah okay

that you would not last two weeks which would be you know to ... shows right to ... and you'd be you'd be to buy a mile I think you ward maybe seven eight shows in a row and then you should hear\nThey tapered off a little bit right okay um because what was happening is that I was getting like too much like like what am I stepped [noise] what is my ... pm you know 'cause I can be a little obsessive compulsive yes a little OCD\nWho and who would dare say that about it I mean we were\nJust upstairs and I am I I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael's\nHere for the pizza but ah you I thought you were a guy thought holy cow Kim is going to eat pizza\nSchools here in front of the pizza [noise] but uh do I thought you were a guy I thought

heart t._v. is one of the great benefits of modern technology but when your next to the Internet becomes vulnerable\nWell news out this past week say that the way like Sony Robbie televisions you really need to get into the settings and do what system update because there are now free critical blocks so that means is that hackers can come in\nAnd they can come in and take over the television and the ones that are in the television they could take over the entire network\nAnd anything else that may be connected to anything else that may be connected to it rather do to learn more about it and said she liked me and to check to see if you were brought me is on the list look no further than commando dot com dot com which are they're hit that show picks button stay right where you are\nYou're still on Facebook some three D. photo they're coming your way you're on the case commando show [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAs a business owner I rely on down small business technology advisors\nI'm coming to you know there's a small about our businesses are reputation is always on the line and that's where the gal small business technology advisors comment reliable gal he's seen what they tell car processors rock solid\nI get I get it but where if you pay them a certain fee that they will spotlights your business [noise]\nYou'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you to be for you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn\nWhat it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results that well right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now\nAnd it's not going to cost you a lot of money because you can do a cost per click campaign\nSo somebody types and whatever your medical profession is in your town within the ZIP codes\nHe may be pay ten cents for every click\nBut you're not going to be at the bottom of page you're not going to be on page too so you start thinking of different ways that you can market your business instead of putting that money and depending upon somebody else to quote unquote get rid of the bad stuff on line\nOkay is that makes sense\nFor us to say um I I Do promote some customers I Try to get them to go on and put on a positive review forest which just to get them to do it as like a should I Try to at a pet\nOr something yes and that's a rank them so they can you do it here now\nYeah you put a pet right there exactly ah that's really smart\nAnd number you know and you could have a former they fill out you know positive and then they check a box that says this this can you know this goes up to health grades or whatever it may be\nBut the other thing too is you can have a basket their gift basket and every thirty days we pick a winner from that gift basket\nOkay so we pick a winner from somebody who did who left a positive review or somebody who left in great review for us light and so and that's that can\nThat little card or that can be on the printed receive that could be part of the\nAnd that little card or that can be on the printed receive that could be part of the email confirmation or the text that they get confirming appointments and you know so you start so you know sit down and just make a list of all the different touch points that you have with that particular customer\nAnd then think of different ways that you can give them an incentive you know\nMaybe they write a negative review that's okay if you learn something from it you know you move on you make itself better but ... and you start telling them what you want and that's the thing about people most people want to help you most people are really good nature\nBut they may not know that this is what you need and so if you tell them at least four times to the average person has to hear something four times before they act\nAs that hopefully they'll get in there and do that now if for some reason this doesn't work and thirty days\nAnd want you to give me a call back and we'll go to the next level but I think you'll find that people will give you that review as long as you ask for and thank you for your call or let's talk about one of our great sponsors I drive dot com and I
