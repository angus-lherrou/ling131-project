being done the hard part would be doing the watch ads like um have you tried to do like to watch as his paws yeah that that would be difficult but otherwise I mean you could just get an apple watch and download whatever face you want to it or you know it it is being done a lot so it's it's such a good idea it's already being done\nOkay I got another one okay fire way Bible Belt Bible Belt\nSo you have belts when we're with songs on so you have your Bible verses on\nI like it you know you just put little buttons on it\nAnd whatever mood you're in or whatever you need motivation or you need some spiritual support kick the button hit a button on your belt what do you think I like it okay like it 'cause you know how you feel like you can get like greeting cards now when you open them the different songs yeah\nThat's what you do you just pre record 'em and you just press a little button now they they Fritz out that I'm really quickly right 'cause you know who knows where your bell goes and you know you drop it on the floor and everything but yeah you could sell some particularly use them as fundraisers for churches yeah\nBut what if I did it where I put the actual verse on the belt\nThat's harder because it's hard to read when you're wearing it oh and then you know if somebody else started to read it but you know it would be cool along those same lines like famous ... favorite moments from your sports your favorite sports teams history\nAnd you're able to press a button yeah and you'd hear you know\nDirt takes it to go over that uh you know or you know or laugh\nYou know from the game this week for you know for the home run with Bradley and you know others that I can see happen just press a button right on your on your belt and bam you're you're you're all of a sudden in a better mood\nWhich one pitch you heard the elevator pitch on shark tank where you said I got to have that\nI got to be involved in it\nThere's there's a lot of them actually are on there was what okay there's one this season I probably shouldn't give it away but this guy is just a redneck dude and had a a flatbed truck truck and he wanted to be able to when he tell gated she has to be able to create his own little wading pool that he could take with them\nSo like you're going to a SEC football game and you just eat he's got discovered that you put in the better the truck and then you fill it up with water and you've got a pool and so when it's hot game early in the season and you just sit there chilling in your pool drinking beer I'm like\nIs Jared how are you in Washington ... near the president and members of his family and Pittsburgh to honor the victims of Saturday's shooting at a synagogue\nThe president's initial stop was the tree of life synagogue where eleven people were shot dead Saturday tributes included a candle lighting and place to go stones from the White House and the white roses that each of the victims memorials outside the synagogue\nThe president was joined by first daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner as well as treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin all three practice\nOf the president were also seen saying his presence took away from honoring the dead and so they knew governor and Pittsburgh mayor did not join the president today Fox has\nGone off scot Robert powers to suspect got 'em and face the death penalty if

don't think he's Nineteen years of age I have no sources on that she just has such a mature again oh I Want to get there shouldn't be for a rich comes on edge Tom Brady on who's the best quarterback of all time what shooting say and what did he say\nWhat are you should say is I'm the best quarterback of all time\nWhat he did say he can't say Aaron Rodgers next week's opponents the best quarterback of all time\nHe'll mention Aaron Rodgers he'll saying ... Montana let's hear what he had to say on W. E. E. on this morning\nThere's a lot of factors that going to help your team win you know it's hard to compare positions and arrows and I think it's just it's impossible to answer but I think that's one of the best ever to play the game [noise] um you know he's he's got every every skill you need to be a great quarterback\nYeah you know I Would like to know what Bill Belichick would say if you said who has the most ... who's most talented quarterback you'd you in the game I Wonder if he would say er and ...\nEven though times the best quarterback right to Reggie on the wishes Miller the hall of fame or one of the greatest three point shooters of all time rage on the call with Kevin Harlan for the pelicans in the blazers edge Thursday night at ten thirty eastern good morning read show are you\nGood morning theater and I have to agree with Mr Tom Brady you can't compare the position or it's hard to compare arrows or if the question is who's the best quarterback in two days game\nObviously it would be Tom Brady if you're asking who is the best quarterback of all time I would probably side with Tom Brady but if you're a Tom Brady you can't see yourself\nSo the best ... fold answer will be Joe Montana I think a universal most people think Joe Montana is the greatest quarterback\nBut if you're going by championships and today it's different rules when Joe played um you would probably have to say Tom Brady I Would default because I Love old school to Joe Montana but new school guys I get Tom Brady so uh if you're asking the man himself\nHe can nominate an adult so he's probably say Joe Montana All right you've got to throw Aaron Rodgers in there because I mean he's gone against them to sweat the Sunday service or whatever\nThose are yeah All right great three point shooters full time is\nYou're asking me my opinion yes\nI've said this many times I'm Still drawing draws impact of it as the greatest three point shooter that I've ever seen\nBut staff is not slowly\nBut staff is not slowly very convincingly knocking down that wall of being a greater three point shooter\nAnd after what I saw last night I mean I'm not going to go off one performance but this is a pattern that clay has put out just a couple of years ago when he had the most points and a half and went ... with nine dribbles\nScoring to fifty something points um staffing clay will go down as arguably\nOr two of the greatest shooters to ever play this game and the maddening thing about it ended up there on the same team and there's only one basketball and you add Kevin to rent to the mix and pretty soon boogie cousins and they're still the successful so for people saying oh they've won back to back they're going to have a championship hanging over\nSteve Kerr and his staff and the team I give them credit\nThey're finding ways to stay engaged and when one of them gets hot\nIt's almost like a video game for them because they feed off of that and they want to see them succeed staff was justice\nExcited getting his MBA three\nPointer record broken that I think clay was and I think that's what's keeping this team engaged and once boogie cousin and comes back he's seen this on the bench I Want to be a part of this that's why no one's going to be able to test this team barring major injury that they're they're playing against themselves right now\nYou know uh should we moved to a three point shot back three point line\nNo no we believe would become a gimmick if they did that I mean\nIn years past the signature and basketball was what the slam dunk yeah everyone wanted to be like Mike your tongue was out your legs were spread you were trying to jump from the free throw line like Dr j\nThe dog was at times can be the most thrilling act in our game but over the last\nSeven to ten years Fifteen Years\nIt's been a three point shot and if you go to any local\nPlayground if kids are still playing on the playground a YMCA or a gym or whatever\nKids aren't trying to have their tongues out and you know jump like Michael Jordan 'cause they can't but everyone can think they can shoot like Steph Curry and his pregame ritual and his ... and his shooting from twenty five thirty five forty five feet everyone thinks they can do that when they walk into a gym\nThe three point line has revolutionized would use basketball is now it's not the dunk it's three point people want to be like Steph Curry like clay Thompson it's no longer the high flyers it's all about the shooter's in a man\nBut what if I took out the three point shot completely how would that went with Golden State be so much better than everybody else without their three point line\nUh yes they would just be long twos\n[laughter]\nBelonging to but they're not taking the I think probably what are they Eighteen in three pointers attempted so far the CCS hurting efficiency death or ... percent but then that surprise you they don't do volume Houston does volume ... the the Golden State warriors don't\nAh it doesn't surprise me because I I think they're getting more efficient the older they get ... remember analytics\nFor Houston is huge you know they they they want to be true from three free throws\nIn labs whereas Kevin to rent the game is still mid range it's an old school game\nAnd even though clay and and stuff are a very efficient and high volume three point shooters that's not really ... game now Katie could knock him down for three obviously but if that mid range game and getting the the free throw line that sets up a draft game so\nThose numbers don't surprise me they're not like Houston where they're going to live and die by their three which caught up to them and last year ... versus Golden State um they can be to choose as well\nTalking to Reggie Miller
