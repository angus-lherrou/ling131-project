I'm Talking with Alan Gottlieb founder of a Second Amendment foundation our rich in Bozeman, Montana wants to know does Allen feel that the bruising confirmation hearing with Kavanaugh is going to have an impact on\nAn upcoming SCOTUS nomination\nWith Trump and do you also feel that he will get another nomination attempt here in the next two years before his first term is up\n... let me answer your color or\nYour your listener or for the second part of it first no one really knows for sure if that's going to be another nomination the next couple of years or you need a vacancy and we don't know for sure there's a vacancy\nAs a you know el ... elderly people on the court that that could be stepping out a and a is a chance uh that that could happen\nI think his bruising nomination basically is it going to stop Trump from putting somebody else on the court who supports gun rights is pretty well dedicated that I've worked with the White House staff up to the Kavanaugh a\nYou know and Gorsuch for that matter a ... nominations and and I have to believe that you know why he he he looked to put another ... salt program personnel on the on the Supreme Court\n... with a Democrat is going to go crazy with it yeah they sure are yeah I like his point out in an addict is is that you know getting a cabin or through a we had a big fight on our hands the gun lobby in this country for ...\nYou know like a Bloomberg and every town in a ... gun ownership\nOr the Brady center or you know and Gabby Giffords group spent a fortune and we're out there with you know email blast news releases everyday to fire up ethic and people\nTo to lean on senators uh luckily you know groups like the ... the right to keep and bear arms in Iraq or you know we will be in\nA it's a double that we get one and not just getting a Kevin on the court but we actually beat our opponents' big time you know in in a big fight or whether you're trying to make sure that I have a pro gun judge wouldn't be on that court because they know what it meant to them for future cases coming to the court I Can't look into crystal ball for you're a listener\nAnd say for sure what's going to happen as far as if they could see being there all I Know it's if there's going to be a vacancy\nAnd ... percent positive Trump will make sure it's a pro gun kept a nominee\nI'm I'm going to make an educated guess I Love your answer by the way on all counts I'm going to make an educated guess that rich is probably talking about a no doubt Ginsburg\nYou know who knows what happened what's going to happen with Ginsburg over the next couple of years but like I said we're just going to have to wait and see we don't have a crystal ball\nSo we will do that rich in Bozeman, Montana thank you very much for the email I Do appreciate if you've got a question for Alan market armed American radio dot ORG you just heard me I'll get it on the air for you if it's a good one send it in market armed American radio dot ORG real quick staying on that hearing process Allen I we've talked with you over the last few months\nAnd that hearing process Alan and we've talked with you over the last few months we know how comfortable you were with the with the selections and I'm sure you would be with the next one on the list that you saw as well and then having to work with the White House but the process itself\nIs so broken and the Democrats what they did was so violent so disgraceful I don't know if I were on that list that I'd want to go through it out what kind of impact you think that's going to have going forward\n[noise] well you're right you you put yourself out there and there's no doubt you become a target on your back and the Democrats go crazy will preserve\nA and and you know but it it it's a prized possessions being the Supreme Court justice so you know you get nominated it's hard to say no I'm not going to go through it but there's no doubt they'll throw in the kitchen St plus law\nOr wherever it is not many especially as his support gun rights or\nYou know again I pointed out in previous shows if you lock that the anti gun moving this country is W. hating gun owners because we're the ones who is possible for the states like you know uh you know Pennsylvania and you know a ... Michigan I those states that this does blue states that went red\n... than ours turned out a lot of independents Democrats that but they voted the second amendment first uh and that put Trump across the finish line in the states like colonial victory or so they they are that they want to get even with us more than anything because it's be upset their whole agenda\nIt's interesting when you were talking about the anti gun groups the professional gun prohibition is very well funded from Michael Bloomberg and I want to go to Michael Bloomberg and the next segment with you as well ah some statements he recently made\nThat if you were I made we would be called racist for well what you hear him and just a minute but having said that he was very noticeable to me that while yes I saw some visible anti gun propaganda out there it seemed to me that the mainstream media focus more on the whole wacko lunatic\nYou know pink cat wearing crazy we're all gonna die we're going into the back alley type fights seem to get more than the gun than than the anti gun or do you think there was a reason for that or was it just the other group of so vocal\n[noise] uh I think their polling data show that they were better off to push that on a front better than the gun issue with the upcoming midterm elections\nOkay that would make absolute perfect sense of polling data did come into an awful lot of play there a real quick I let me just go to Bloomberg now because it's not something I Want to spend a lot of time on and we're while we're on the subject of and we've got a couple of minutes\nIt turns out that on the fifth Bloomberg was reported at a GOP USA and I guess uh they link to it from Washington Times former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reportedly argued friday the guns needs to be kept out of the hands of minorities in order to keep them alive while\nSpeaking at the Aspen Institute Bloomberg Seventy two so Ninety five percent of murders fall into a category\nA male minority between the ages of Fifteen and twenty five quoting cities need to get guns out of this group than and keep them alive the former three term ... said these kids think they're going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed\nThey just don't have any long term focus on anything it's a joke to have a gun to joke to pull the trigger and he said something like this a couple of years back we talked about my gosh I Wonder if any of us said that we'd be racist all day long if serious about that\n[noise] that he I think is serious about it that's his lead is showing real uh\nYou know the demand and me and he really is a noxious and if you're a minority you surely issue that this is a guy that thinks he knows how to run your life that you can run on your own it really doesn't matter of our guts or sugary drinks I mean this guy is crazy I mean he ... he wants to cradle to grave take care of all of us in his banner\nHis way give us no freedom period\nYou know I always found it interesting out and we'll take this into the bottom of having to go into the break the next segment within a couple more topics but always found it interesting just ironic\nTo me I found it humorous it was comical to me that while Bloomberg was the mayor of New York he was going after what you just say sugary drinks too much soda telling people what to eat and you hear this stands up at the podium and kicks off every year the Nathan's hotdog eating contest with these guys are shoving Seventy five hotdogs down their stomach after ten minutes\nAnd wash it down and they're serving all kinds of beer and soda and areas up on the podium giving it a big kick off I always thought that was kind of ironic I guess if it if it brings money and attention it's okay\nBut if not just for you okay for me not for the type of thing with Michael Bloomberg always found that interesting\nBut I also find with is interesting because the largest fastest growing group of gun owners in America are minorities and you and I saw that together with the groups that we met with and heard speak at the G R PC twenty seconds to the break I'll let you take it away isn't that the case\nYeah we had lots of minorities people of color policy conference in Chicago a A R R diversity is growing and of course that scares the antique enters as well uh ... yeah ... yeah I mean we're going to win this battle over time it's just we have to stay in the ...\nA lot to do it will also Bloomberg\nOverstated so what do you mark do\nThey will also Bloomberg is pushing for the other states that don't have ballot measure initiatives or laws to push up as they can open up they get them in other states as well well well well what can help anybody help out but like vote no\nI I don't know sixteen thirty nine that or\nVote no sixty nine that or make a donation helpless but less than advertising it's really important uh attack in our website and sending it to that we're working all the groups in Washington state and citizens getting ready to keep her arms well sort of a coalition to go to a vote no sixteen thirty nine dot org\nVote no sixteen thirty nine dot org you heard that please please please go their vote no sixteen thirty nine dot org look I don't care if you're a gun owner or not\nBut if you value your freedoms if you value your freedoms you have got to oppose this measure\nAnd I you know honestly Allen\nIt makes me sick to my stomach to see what the media that we all saw what the media did with the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else the to the same type media that now you just said his burying when you've got three major law enforcement groups\nThese are people that people trust people trust law enforcement and they trust law enforcement\nIn Washington state Washington you listening on a number of radio stations now in throughout the Pacific northwest in neighboring states you trust law enforcement and you trust what law enforcement says they oppose something that's a pretty fair bet that you want to look into it and probably oppose it as well\nI don't I I hate to see that the media is getting away with doing that but I I just I don't know when it comes to that kind of money\nAnd Bloomberg and an hour and and the rest of them out there you got a lot of billionaires [laughter] your neck of the woods\nAt ... let me give you a crazy show how bad as well as play women say in Washington state just like this to carry concealed has a hard time getting their first catalyst is perfect illegal she comes home to her own house\nPuts the purse down on the kitchen table at the getting it to go to the rescue she left in the kitchen and the curse she now sell it\nHold it hold about she carries it lawfully comes home puts it on the person use the drops a purse off uses the restroom she's a felon\nIn our own home\nOn sixteenth or not listener you're paying attention to this and I know what caused you're talking about Alan would you let listeners know why that is\nWell because the safe stores so called her to go to the law or it has to do it in her reach where she fell right now out on the street it's legal but in our own home it's not\nIf she gets followed home someone steals her purse off the counter or pushes her do whatever picks her purse off of her she's now liable if that gun is used is she not\nOh she becomes a very large scale and in fact that they go up to her more than the criminals stole the gun so once you get demise by the criminals stole the gun and they just picked up by by the state because she has been stolen\nHow how's this going to be enforced and obviously I I Know this is why law enforcement is not supporting those but how could this possibly being forced\nWell that's a good question I obviously they're not going to go house to house but in you know I played it is and if they get those force it but by and large it's not going to be enforced just like the previous and they said the test and Washington state you know ah on on five five or ... Ninety five Ninety One I think it was\nUh the thing is that we've had two prosecutions in in three four years now one of the judge threw out they love to bake the prosecutor and the other like the prosecutor the blood exist it anyway so ... million a million dollars to spend on the ballot measure that only harass legitimate law abiding gun owners and they did nothing to stop crime whatsoever\nAnd I got to tell you I I'm I'm In a really good mood right now because I I I don't know why I'm feeling like we're going to make some headway in Washington I don't know why I have that feeling but I just do I I'm\nHearing things from people more so than I normally would about sixteen thirty nine and other issues I Hope that what I'm hearing\nMeans that we're actually going to get through to some people decide which should lead thank you sir for everything that you do I'm going to cut you will not let you go do what you do on a Sunday thank you for everything you do Alan Gottlieb essay F dot org joined us lifetime membership a hundred and fifty bucks Rob Pincus will be here right after this don't go away\n[noise]\n\nGun owner you're running out of time to claim your free lifesaving guide and you're re audio book if you want the truth about what really happens when you use your going to come to visit with\nThe U.S BPA free shocking cruise stories of self defense audio book and critical self defense survival guide you can finally protect yourself with the troops to armed responsible back on and get your right now you'll be amazed by the crew stories of deadly shootings and violent attack but you'll be even more shock when you discover what happened after\nBecause making just one mistake can be the difference between freedom for jail don't leave yourself vulnerable with your green guided audio book you'll know when you can and can't do what to do when the police arrived and how to survive\nOh when you can and can't do what to do when the police arrived and how to survive the legal aftermath was if you act now you also get a bonus deadly force check whether that's three lifesaving tools one hundred percent free but this is your last chance and don't miss out\nGo to armed in responsible dot com right now that's armed and responsible dot com visit armed and responsible dot com\nDo you have two minutes for a great tip concerning defensive firearms or the concealed carry lifestyle check out into the fray a weekly video blog hosted by Kevin ... editor of concealed carry magazine into the fray covers every aspect of self defense from legal and ethical issues\nTo the latest gear and tactics accurate direct and easy to share with all your friends you can find every episode of into the fray at into the fray video dot com that's into the fray video dot com\nThe second amendment foundation has grown into what many believed to be the most important gun rights organization in America with hundreds of\nThousands of active members in the second amendment foundation defending your rights in courtrooms across the nation\nWinning these battles in local jurisdictions all the way to the Supreme Court requires tireless efforts and help from you please help the second amendment foundation defend your freedoms by joining or donating today at ... dot O.

All right and of course cross breed holster and everything that goes with them let's go to a W. R. Hawkins in a W are let's talk briefly about cross breed because you wrote a great piece\nAbout one of my favorite holster with cross read and I love when you do this\nBecause we get to talk about this stuff off the air like hey man do you use the ... or do you use the slides snap slide or tell me a little bit about this type of up to protect you use is we have these great conversations and everything you write about the whole story is everything that I see in response to come back\nTo everybody like it to send it to Cairo in the crew across the whole ... you wrote about and tell us what you wrote up and and why and what you found out\nThere will sap slot is a little different than the cross breed for the listeners you know cross breed is inside the white span snap slot as outsiders snaps lot has\nIt has a large piece of leather behind it now and then you can get it with horror side but for the most part leather and then it has a cosmetics mold for your gun to fix to that letter and as with the super took\nThe beetle ever dissipates the weight of the gun the presence of the gun it ... it's\nUnbelievably comfortable uh what else I like about it is it holds the gun tight and ah I like that so that will outlive and T shirts you know and\nI can I can with a T shirt with that whole ... H. E. K. U. S. P. Compaq I carried a Springfield ... the non sub compact\nAnd I carried a what was the other one a Beretta or a PX century and that's a fairly you know that got the same size as a God my team right came under a T shirt concealed because it hold it against your body and hot and I just love the host and uh you know\nAnd it is cross breed so it's quality and I'm just so that it 'cause that's what I've learned not\nIt's free so it's quality and I'm just so that it 'cause that's what I've learned not I didn't learn that cause someone told me I learned it because I use the posters and uh\nIt just it's a great holster and it's also affordable in my opinion compared to other posters of the same genre you can acquire one of those for about forty nine dollars I think it's ... it's going to last a lifetime so that's it it's sort of\nCrap I like the high like the way it holds up high too I've got a number of I'm a I'm a big fan of\nOf the uh the uh the drops wide as well depending on what type of gun up you've got a little bit larger gun drops I worked well for me too but the super talk of course we talked about the stupid thing I remember the first time you've tried that to protect you called me the next thing about oh my God it was\nSatellite radio moment words all over the place your reaction was very similar to mine the first time mark the ... the founder and the designer of the original super talking God rest his soul from\nIt's been like it's hard to believe in so long since he passed away already but I remember when mark called me just do me a favor I heard you talking about this on the radio don't give up inside the waistband carry I Try my holster\nAnd boy I tell you your reaction was very similar to mine on that of the ... the way it dissipates the weight is worthy of note because I wouldn't have believed it when you looked at it originally I thought this can't possibly be whom I forgot I had a full sized block them ... W are\nBut but and with the sap slide you maybe think of something else with the ... the can't owned a gun is perfect\nAnd ah but yeah uh with with with the super cook and I think I've said this radio before before I said the first time I said I should say what I'm going to say but I'm going to ... again uh I Know of taking a nap twice ... cycle and then my gun in it and\nThat just 'cause I I literally it it's so comfortable back there I don't think about\nMy guns being on them and that's the only way I can tell you because we knew for me I just don't like it inside the wastepaper Carey hopes for\nA a unless it's extremely small or whatever in ... but then you realize is what the cross free\nLet's assume protect does everything has a purpose it's not it's not wider than a normal host or because they're sloppy it's not taller than another host or because they're sloppy or didn't plan it out it dissipates the president in white or that gun and when you put that separate check on you will forget you're carrying a gun\nAnd ah you know I don't mean that the reckless fashion obviously that's the kind of comfort we're talking about I found that same comfort with snatch lots\nYou know yeah in the outside the waistband it's it's really true I got to take this remainder\nTo tell the story about this about mark I have to because it's a great story I did a commercial for them I was a TV\nTeacher [noise] camera peace with them telling the same story but\nMarket hurt me talking mark ... founder of cross breed it'd be many years ago had heard me talking about how I of essentially given up on WB inside the waistband Kerry from my full size gun I just couldn't find anything that works I've got a number of great manufacturers and the number of great super high quality ... they just were not working for me\nAnd he heard me swear off on that and heard me say I was lucky I Lived in Georgia and outside the waistband carrying was not going to be a problem\nAnd he called me and he said wait don't give up let me send you this holster\nAnd I want you to try this and what you do me if they want you to get up when you get up in the morning at seven thirty more time you get up I Want you to put it on what you put your gun in it and when she worked for twenty four\nHours don't take it off and that's exactly what I did I got the host or on a Saturday I went to work and broadcast it on a Sunday put that thing on seven thirty in the morning\nI wore it all day long broadcasting and it came back and as I Want to do on Sundays after the monster showy W I fell asleep on the couch woke up about seven o'clock the next morning forgot I had it on\nUntil I got up and went upstairs and take a shower that's how comfortable that holster was but then I told I told that story\nMany many many times in and I know that you you experienced and I thought it's just a cool story to tell I called markets you God thank you he said I Want to participate on your show your welcome to and we've been to cross breed holster studios ever since its just remarkably design a piece of equipment that we've got thirty seconds did you want to close out real fast\nBut yeah I mean the host or just remarkable but as I say both of them are but yeah it says\nYou can tell nothing nothing on these posters as they are by chance and materials chosen the way they're put together everything on these posters is all winter and that's the bottom line where you're inside the lifespan or outside or either way you go snap slide or super taught so winter\nThis can happen to you you anywhere at Starbucks at Walmart at CBS wherever you are at church it can happen to you right there in it so\nThe only tool you'll have for self defense at that moment is the tool you'd have with you so ask yourself what do you have with you and it it is for all you have is a cell phone or off all you have is a cell phone in a brushing your purse well then I'm going to tell you right now you're at a disadvantage from the get go\nAnd you know it's a great point and again if some theater of the mind here\nFathers mothers your daughter work at Starbucks you may be working her way through college hoping pay some bills\nYou may be working her way through college up and pay some bills maybe she's working uh you know to to buy a new car young maybe you've got a young daughter\nThis this is what you want your daughter thinking when she goes to a Starbucks I don't want to die this way that's what she's thinking it's going to work at a Starbucks that day she has to think that if she's being beaten to the ground\nOh my God I don't want to die this way I'm just going to work what the hell\nThank God a man had a gun you know if the media told these stories every day the way they should\nAmericans would think a lot different about David how there wouldn't be David hogs and there wouldn't be every town for gun safety is if the media told the story is like you do All right let's let's go to another story that I think is really important that you wrote about all of them are but in particular\nAre you talk a little bit about Wells Fargo gun owners are under attack from a lot of different areas\nEspecially in New York with Mary ... Mario Cuomo right ... and I'm packing the national Rifle Association and insisting that banks no longer do business with us but Wells Fargo box corporate gun control\nIssues forty million dollars in credit to Ruger firearm ... oh I thought you shouldn't be doing that\nRight well you know that Wells Fargo I think in April I reported Wells Fargo book or the ... to ... they said look it's not up to a bank to sit us gun policy and uh I think since Sandy Hook attack they've done four hundred thirty one million dollars with the gun industry and\nBottom line as their ah ah I Believe it was their CEOs said it you know that what they're doing is they're working with companies that make products that are legal and uh so why not do business with companies that make products that are legal and you know uh\nIt just it's silly of me not to me I remember when I was in graduate school I'll be very fast people make fun of it because I like narrative history goes from point a to point B tells a story\nThey said no one teaches narrative history anymore and they all laughed at me in class and not go well good good deal like oh you mean like a well it's no one else was interested in getting the job you know and this is the same thing for\nWells Fargo here no one else has gone along these groups money so Wells Fargo here as up to the extent these lines of credit lake the interest on it the bank will get rich as they can be off of it just like they\nWould get rich off anything that they loan four hundred and thirty one million dollars to and Wells Fargo was a genius in my opinion for uh being brave enough say well look these are legal companies where we're gonna we're going to use their money to make more money for our bank and I think I think kudos to Wells Fargo for that\nYou know what's fascinating to me too and I bet this comes into play\nOr not but I'm going out to a tombstone Arizona in a week week from tomorrow the name Wells Fargo was forever linked with the image of a fix for stage coach thundering across the American west loaded with gold the full history over more than a hundred and sixty years is rich in detail with great events in American history from the gold rush to the early twentieth century\nDo prosperity depression and war Wells Fargo earned a reputation of trust due to a detention and loyalty it paid to its customers get this and this is really really cool\n[laughter] I'm going to run out of time for someone to have to tell you when we come back from the break but I Am going to tell you\nWhen we come back from the break about Wells Fargo history just one or two quick line that I think might have something to do with the fact that they like doing business with a meeting real American value their right to keep and bear\nArms that goes on stage in\nThe\n\n...
