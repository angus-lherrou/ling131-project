I Love the home runs I think that you know it's great to get three runs a one swing that goes all the way back to our Weaver\nBut they just don't do 'em a base it to right field the score to they just they they just don't do it Sanchez almost hit it out that would've been\nI'm a great clans have his season and\nUh you know you're waiting on John Carlos and to do it and and he strikes out that's the only way they really know how to score but they insist that that can win in the postseason then I seen it since the last um since two thousand one they won the world series\nAll those are two thousand three two thousand for two thousand five teams they had a lot of home runs and they got knocked out in the playoffs every single time 'cause I truly believe that great pitching will stop you from hitting home runs\nYeah and I look at the red Sox and the influence of of Cora on this roster after coming over from Houston because used in was a strike out team a few years back\nAnd they put the ball and now they still hit home runs everybody does right but I I saw some influence from the Astros on these Red Sox and now you have these two teams clashing handicapped or what you think will play on the ...\nAnd I think is really a good at L.

Machado was at a good last game but you know I don't think he really stood out so I I don't know how these guys if you're getting guys to help you in the postseason\nI mean that's interesting strategy\nBecause I thought the Yankees were built for the regular season when you get into the post season and just like I said with what I saw with the red socks they can do the smaller thing they hit home runs but they can do small things and I think that's what you have to have plus you're pitching staff I gotta have it starting staff that go more than three innings\nYou know these guys didn't even go past three innings except for to naka I mean you're just not going to win\nAnd you know in English by starting pitching has gone down dramatically from two thousand fourteen to now it's been going down every single year the last five years\nThat it's gone down considerably so you're just trying to get to the sixth inning it feels like and then that's where you know he's actually strategy it feels like with these uh these managers I hum update the poll results there make love and then we'll see if day Robert shut to judge\nBy which sport has the biggest gap in player ability between Nineteen sixty eight and now MBA thirty five percent NFL thirty two percent will be down in sixteen percent\nAlright\nYeah I don't know if they're in ...

Holloway or old Oklahoma um yeah it's er auction quarterback that was my guy so that so I kind of emulate it\nBegins to offer came from hill\nAir force academy and how close were you lose your to bury oh that was ... ah\nI yes I I actually\nDid my senior speech in June a I had my point that and uh so I was all set to go and then come to lie I pivoted and decided I didn't want to play football or a or their first got to be so than my search to play college baseball began in July [laughter]\nBut you want to UCLA venue\nI did because uh I got accepted Berkeley or so when the UC system since I got accepted a system it allowed me to get accepted into UCLA\nAnd at that point in time when you're looking at July and August full starts September obviously the scholarships are already kind of a already set in stone and so Gary Adam allows you to be a recurrent walk I got me into school and uh I made the club\nWas [noise] was deep down was an air force academy when you were going there\nHe was number six yes are\nYou are not going to be down deep down\nI was not that I was always in the I was the same conversation like that and I like it I like it\nI like it um we were just talking about starting pitching we're watching the ales Seattle uh last night the Yankees couldn't get their starters past three innings I'm curious what your philosophy is of what you hope to get out of your starters no matter\nIf it's you know crucial or he'll whoever it might be what do you what do you expect to get a hold together\nSo you know what you're saying is that I I think it's hard to put one specific number but obviously I think that because everything is different and where you're talking about have they been used all this stuff but I think obviously a six to six is probably the number that people talk about these days ... where you're talking about postseason baseball\nUm\nBut I Will say this though is that the thing that is challenging for manager now if you hear so much out there so much pressure on on a guy that go to Penn early at a lot of it depends on for me is ah how he's throwing at at who you got coming in so every matter just got to make that decision so ah but I feel it's your question\nIt six sitting seems seems reasonable but obviously I think that our guys are falling off pretty well and if you let the Houston the way there are guys on the ball well you want to get as\nMany as your cat out of the shuttle\nYou'd be talked out is taking somebody out of the game the pitcher\nCan I have yes uh it it\nDoesn't happen very often or it's got to be the right guy and there are certain parts are trying to\nUh fill the equity with a player in a certain spot where something in your gut when you go out to the mound and says there's something in in the boys to look at me I that says I Believe that this guy to get to get through this any or I'm just not convinced but yes I kept\nA what do you make of a Christian yellowish who's he remind you of\nSean green oh Sean green a and the fact that\nThey kind of have that same for the uh same look left left handed that's the outfielder I'm Sean didn't hit for power early in the power came later I'm very athletic guys kind of similar for me\nI don't know\nMaybe eleven you're saying no way he can run a four or five for I don't think that seems ... unbelievable how how old is he takes care of himself\nHe's fifty one we ran with him he ran backwards you know ... yeah well partially backward yeah it didn't matter\nWhich I just posted good times lately well he's improving yeah but he's like six point oh or five nine or something like that and he\nHe enjoys it for a fight yeah but he's not one of the great athletes of all time like the on maybe ...\nIt could be in the wars four or five seems aggressively\n[laughter] does anybody think the thing he owns a for six guy I'm going to get to see he's still quick man you know pulling\nMember of the super bowl and Houston we have the wide receiver Brandon marshal on the line with us and we asked him if he would run with the ending is I don't want to lose\nThat on TV I Know he's he tapped out ... and I do believe Dionne would have run faster than brand and Marshall\nBrand new story of Dionne at their combine that he didn't have issues and he showed up around like a four one nine or somebody that's urban was it\nI think that's so

forty and Julie Galloway there's a handful of people who have gone up for three and the on his ... was one of them well I think the UN Johnson Galloway was a sub sub for two I Believe\nFor one nine I think than crazy John Ross may be the fastest recorded wanted to come by now he had some but that's the thing the on back in the day was in the same computer timing so there's a lot of myth like what Beau Andy On rare you see a it's a John Ross was that for two two\nIs that the ... it was the fact is yeah I I thought Darryl green enjoy Galloway were up there I think like what they consider

to make this announcement when she did and now let's see if I can find somebody who was upset with me as reflected in a lot of those emails I got after the during the during the after the show yesterday here is Melanie Melanie welcome how are you today\n[noise] Hey Mike how are you in good thanks for calling I\nJust wanted to say first you know I'm a supporter of your um you know you haven't lost me as a listener but I was disappointed when yesterday to cheer meter Lee went to a less tactic of thinking the worst about Haley and saying that she thought she was anonymous in that New York article\nIt and why is that a lot of ways that are left tactics\nBecause they immediately want to go to the to the the assumption that Trump has done something wrong and I think\nThey are open and why what did I see yeah let me finish off okay I'm Sorry go ahead and\nFinish my saw her ahead go ahead\nFor the last years is a tactic immediately go onto that Trump has done something wrong I think that the right can at times do the same thing and immediately counter assumption that someone has done something\nThat when we want to try and support chop we find a reason to them so this person gets something like\n... ... well again there there's nothing I said within a million miles to give anybody indication of I bought anything negatively but probably about President Trump's

tempting to follow the siren call of the angry as voices we must resist the temptation\nAre we with no one who's willing to work hard abide by our laws in love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country and then in an interview with NBC as a follow up Nikki Haley specified who she was the one who delivered those words\nAs the Republican response to presidents President Trump's first day of the union she specified that it was Donald Trump\nWho was one of the angry is voices that she was condemning she I remember that Melanie and I suspect with all due respect maybe you don't\nKnow I I Do that I Do like where I'm coming from is I also suspect it something else was going on yeah I'm a follower cue and on I think I I Do read and research thing\nYou have and you
