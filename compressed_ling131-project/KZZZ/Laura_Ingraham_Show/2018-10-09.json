let me start with the fight itself which is a good fight\nThank you for having me back on down I really appreciate it first off I I thought it was a good fight I thought it was compelling um I think everyone knew what was going to happen if you would have told me before the fight that you had seen it already and they went into the championship browns and then you'd have asked me who won I would've guessed Habib\nAnd if you told me you know how how how he won I Would have guessed yeah of course it was with wrestling I think some people were surprised by Connors take down the fence um but his Achilles' heel has always been his wrestling or lack there of and his cardio or lack there of and I think both those things are on display on Saturday\nWas it a good night or bad night for us\nIt was a tremendous Knight who's saying it was a bad night don't listen to you know day to day is doing the whole said dad\n[laughter] I Know [laughter] how he used to be so disappointed and everyone if this\nGets made again and six months rest assured all that footage and then some will be use you know there's talk of a Habib being stripped of his belt none of that is going to happen yeah he might get a slap on the wrist yeah you might get a suspension or find\nSix months has mentioned something like that but let's not forget this is a guy go fight every six to nine months so even if they give them a suspension what does he really losing out on this was the second highest skate and UFC history the highest in the state of Nevada and by all accounts it's going to smash all their pay per view records it was an incredible night for the company\nWould encounter make office by\nHe said that he stands to make around fifty or so million you know a dream of his has always been to make nine figures for an Emma may fight 'em I asked them last week before the fight if he stood to make that he said he was halfway there so not quite what he made for the Floyd Mayweather fight\nBut fifty million if you would have told me five years ago that a fighter in the U.S see what's going to make fifty million for one fight after the pay per view numbers come in and everything like that and he gets to cut the pay per view\nI Would have called you the biggest liar on earth I mean that's just unfathomable I don't think the entire us the rosters making fifty million combined outside of Conor McGregor so this was a very good night for him as well and uh in true Cohn or fashion he's not hiding from this he's not going you know into a dark place he's not looking his words he's already calling for a rematch because\nA he's kind of a competitor MP he knows how much more money than to make in the rematch\nI was curious about this when you had the host fight fight\nAnd you know where it could be goes into the audience the camera angle all of a sudden you know there was morality here with them everywhere in the U.S see where they went way way high above instead of covering it like it's an advantage because remember when the lotto which hit ... yes\nThey drill lampley did play by play all of the fight being being the mainly in the ring\nThat's what I was surprised that it felt

perpetuate\nAny semblance of conservative ideas that are left and the Republican Party because and also as a general rule Republican Party is letting me down year after year after year after year and it's only because we have President Trump\nWho is who is crazy Democrat his whole life but he's acting more conservative than anybody and so it's a strange world we live in but I just want to remind

got smeared very badly the Democrats handled this horrifically and everybody knows\nThere's a lot of bad actors who got involved in this I don't know the Christie Blazak Christine Blasey Ford is necessarily a bad actor Susan Collins said on sixty minutes last night she believes that should that are Christians lousy Ford\nWas sexually attacked\nShe just said I Can't accept that he did it because there is no cooperation and she said frankly I Believe that she was attacked but I don't believe she was attacked by Kavanaugh ... senator college walked away with the conclusion but it was
