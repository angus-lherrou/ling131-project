night ESPN squeezing for western teams New Orleans in Houston Dallas in Phoenix Thursday night or the bulls Seventy Sixers followed by Lakers blazers another double header on friday\nAnd then a a Saturday Night telecast for LeBron's home opener against the rockets\nAnd the league says they're very progressive about their TV schedules NBA data suggest that the leagues young fan bases willing to stay up and the best way to talk about it is to look at Twitter so this is from the NBA home office\nThey they're seeing that younger fans are going to stay up in the NBA has become a younger fans sport\nBut there are questions about this uh you know Instagram they're big on that they cater highlight packages to certain demos a this is big uh around the world but they do that the leagues pushing for technology limits when it comes to highlights using computer vision advanced\nUh algorithms to generate custom highlight packages that are bright idea of a duration for fans that missed last night's game even if you can stay up their catering it to you\nBut that was a a question we had a concern we had of\nBeing able to see LeBron James play and if it's a game it starts at ten thirty at night you know east coast\nThat'll be tough but the NBA doesn't seem too concerned about it because they think the younger fan is going to stay up and watch and if you did watch last night you saw the brawn be LeBron a couple of bright spots Josh heart but you know their team that can shoot the three and they're not a very big team rebounding much these\nAre gonna be problems no matter what and

you and good I Am looking younger I think that's what you're trying to do yeah yeah I hear you at us with the kids are All right we were just talking before the commercial ended and that is that we see how great these kids are now in high school even junior high grade school\nI Wonder if we're going to have a quarterback who have fifty\nGrade school I Wonder if we're going to have quarterbacks who have Fifteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen year careers ... it feels like there's always going to be another quarterback you can get at a cheaper price\nYeah I think it's an interesting conversation I mean because we're in the Arab right now all of the franchise quarterback is bigger than the head coach and you know he's really second on me the pecking order to really the owner but I I I think I agree with you just because of this really\nFootball I think we're finally seeing it's been the most popular sport in America for the last let's say thirty five forty years at least and I think you're seeing with all the specialized training kids are doing this day and age and it's seven ... seven camps and my little boy's eight years old and play and flag football ready and throwing the ball around\nTo doing all that quarterbacks are better than ever physically ready to play more than ever you know just jump right in you can have success whether it's the Carson went to the Russell Wilson's or you know even joke Flaco took his team to the playoffs as a rookie all that\nIt's going to be interesting too because we're seeing that these franchise quarterbacks and their contracts or\nThey're messing up how you build a team and we've seen teams built that can go to the super bowl like the eagles last year with quarterback on rookie contracts and I do wonder if that happens because this year\nOutlets that I haven't studied the quarterbacks coming out in the draft this year but I Know who the top ones are and you're going to have another four or five first routers again this year I mean it it seems to be it's going to be a wave of guys every year that have\nFranchise quarterback superstar potential and um I think you know your thoughts there could be could be interesting going forward\nAnd that's why I Wonder if I like Derek car right\nIs already on the clock in Oakland it seems like that I just can't imagine that he's going to be their quarterback when they get to Vegas a couple of weeks ago we had questions about ... I still don't know if he's a franchise quarter of a he's a bargain now yes but after next year is he a bargain at a hundred million don't\nYeah I Would say no I mean as of right now and I really liked ... a Democrat Scott but I'm not paying them twenty five million dollars a year right now from what I've seen the last two years and even this year and it's been good uh don't get me wrong but yeah I think that'll be interesting Derek hard to yeah\nYou know this year I don't think they're going to give up and I applaud them quite yet I'll say this because the officer coordinator they're under ... Greg Olsen and he was there in Oakland when they drafted Derek or originally\nSo I think he is a little more backing there\nBut next year will be the big year like yeah if he doesn't perform next year you might be right he might not be there in Vegas\nYeah I I I'd be interested to see what ... does that Prescott the cowboys that often it's going to continue to struggle they need to go to Seattle\nLike five years ago Russell Wilson the smoke shock on quarterbacks inside and runs read options bootleg play action packed to the receivers are not good enough to drop backpack game as ... creative enough to where they're going to win that type of football game so pay decent\nPlay like the two thousand Thirteen Seattle Seahawks I think that's their best chance to win again\nHow did everybody ... not everybody how did most people miss on Patrick bombs um\nI didn't know that\nYou know well okay you're you're you're there with me okay good good good I live I'm the one washing Texas Tech football game so bright but stayed right Saturday afternoon\nI think that the the problem though right there I think that was the first issue when I\nFirst came out and made a video like right after the NFL season ahead ended and we're getting towards combine time and I'm a value waiting quarterbacks and ... here we go to combine I gotta catch up on the draft what the hell's going on who the guys and more homes is one of the first guys I turned on\nI went on to bleach report and broken down and made it we had a little video of his highlights I said this guy special like this is Aaron Rodgers Brett Farr type special\nAnd I even had been NFL coach friends like\nOh you're crazy ants taxes jackets it's it's not he's not ready to play in the NFL and I was going man this is not the same old Texas Texas is not like he's throwing a\nTen bubble screens and has a hundred yards off the bubble screen that he hasn't ... him making the system it was him making big time throws and I think the emblem on the helmet and they're off and it's kind of hurt his overall\nYou know what do I want to say just the how great he was or how he was looked at his perception is the word I was looking for their as far as a top ten quarterback\nWell year breaking him down as a former quarterback I only answered the phone call from a friend who's an NFL scout who said uh keeping on homes he's gonna be the guy moving up the draft yeah and then I came in and told the Dennis I said\nBut it's getting homes on yeah and they were like why I go he's the guy coming up you know moving up yes and it's going crazy here\nIt was special like when you watch this film I mean first of all he threw forty one touchdown passes and I believe ten interceptions so it's not like he was like some ... gunslinger but that was the label I Know that's what's it's unfair and it was like do\nYou know take some blame yourself I didn't even like what he said about diary kill a few weeks ago I thought that was kind of demeaning so special is yeah I mean or he's a weapon but isn't that what the receiver supposed to be last time I checked I Want my receiver to be a weapon\nOr I mean he'll special anybody faster than try Rachel and again I don't think so like I think he gets to top speed faster than any but I don't know\nI don't think so like I think he gets to top speed faster than any but I don't know if he's the faster but I think he gets there there are a lot of these guys would you want speed or quickness and wide receiver ooh\nThat's that's a really good question I get speed if you made me choose I Would choose speed\nUm just because the speed factor with a guy you could throw outside right you can just put 'em outside\nIt's going to open him up on so many other routes because the bees are always like oh I'm worried about him running the goal route and then he puts the brakes on any runs the crow route or he runs the comeback route and all that's predicated on the fear of the speed going down field but then you say Ira kills the best receiver and again best receiver and football right after you may may choose I'm taking ...\nHave you on me you go hey you could throw go routes any receiver and football I go I'm taking number ten from the chase you go you could throw a slant route someone one receiver of all by up I'm taking diary killing the chiefs\nIf you go let me add one of those little you know in vogue quarterback shuffle foot foot the speed sweep looking place I'm taking ... kill yeah he might not be the most nuanced runner\nA route runner like some of the other guys but he is a threat to score an eighty or touched down on the field at any point also with the attention\nThat is you know put towards him he opens up so much more on the off and so\nYou know he's fourth and receiving yards right now out of all the big time receivers he's leading and yards per catchy tied for first touchdown I think it's time you don't have to agree with you that he's the best receiver but it's time we start to say he's one of the two three four best receivers in football yes if I gave you the rams are the field in the NFC\nI Would take the rams right now yeah I I I have a hard time going against it because you know you you talked about golf too and I was kind of a golf hater I'll I'll admit that like last year when he threw twenty eight touchdowns in seven are sections I said\nThe most quarterbacks a football could have done that and that often what he's doing this year and and let's take away last week 'cause he didn't play that game but he's doing this year is when planes are served up form on the silver platter\nHe's making plays himself and that's a big thing for me and the value of their quarterback you know everybody's covered the protections bad what are you going to do like we see an Aaron Rodgers or a Brady do every week and he is this year made plays moving around in the pocket made some big time drove down the field and you know he's a definitely improved and\nAnd those areas think Rogers need surgery on that knee I sure hope not and then I Hope this by we get some healthy because I Want to see 'em close you don't know if he's going to get help I Know it's hard especially when you're asked to do everything on the team every week I mean there is on one knee second team and leading rushing last week\nAnd y and Z calling out of his head coach or why isn't something stay quiet I [noise] I don't know the one\nI think he wants it out there I think he's pushing the coaches because they need new ideas and the building\nAnd I can I just go to my head coach and say what are we missing here we're not on the same page here it's like John ... the owner of the giants right holds it he has a press conference or he's being interviewed he talks about auto back into it or why not go to back him and say\nI Need you to be quiet just play we gave you this morning yeah you know your future yeah why does everything have\nTo be out there in front of me well maybe in both cases they already did that and it just didn't get through that's where I think of it I mean that's where I thought one ... with the Roger state you know Green Bay new needs new ideas than the building there still run the Nineteen Ninety seven Brett Farr Green Bay and I'm not even joking I'm Serious\nAnd you know oh Joe Philbin comes back in the building this year he's from there it's still they don't even know what they don't know and I think Rogers say like I'm watching these other all senses and they know how to feature these guys every week and you guys are just asking me to dance around back there and make something happen that's are often send her career have\nHave we wasted more of Rogers are breeze with not surrounding them with\nYeah no breeze now has gotten a ... yeah the one guy that got it all going now right yeah they got you know Michael Thomas a great player but Rogers or breathe so non surrounding them to cash in on maybe another ...\nYeah I mean you know my thoughts on Aaron Rodgers he's the greatest quarterback I've ever seen a I so I look at it like that at least breathe has always had one of the greatest off in some minds around him and the ... has always been given a chance\nAnd Rogers case it's just had to be him so much there's never been a run game there's a lack of creative ideas it's really about his physical ability you saw some of those throws at the end of the games and like the guys are wide open you're not like oh wow great play designed you're like\nWhoa there's another bull's eyes throw thirty are down in the field on the shoulder of a guy perfectly place and that's the most\nTalented quarterback it can't be the best because Brady has\n... I I get that I just don't like that argument I mean yeah OK is more decades a team sport\nGame on the line one drive\nTaking Aaron Rodgers ... no no I'm not that I'm not allowed to yell at me no no not if people think I'm a Brady hater because I say is the third graders quarterback of all the time and I I really love Tom Brady I just I Would play the game like Tom Brady if I was the quarterback that's that was the guy I wanted to be with us\nIn like Tom Brady if I was the quarterback that that was the guy I wanted to be but the problem is you pick your dad is second all time Rogers won

those championship teams championship caliber teams\nAnd the patriots you got bell jak and Brady\nBoston doesn't have that luxury interchangeable parts and the fact that you've had different managers now three different managers go to these World Series so that's different but a Red Sox beat the Astros David Price with an impressive performance beating Justin Berliner\nAnd do the Dodgers trying to close out the Milwaukee Brewers coming up later on\nA Lakers losing the bronze debut and you start to slice and dice this and this is what's gonna happen then it's going to happen on a day by day or again by game basis you know you start to use stats you're going to look at the team not shooting well three point range they're not a good three point shooter shooting to [noise]\nUh but Josh heart I Believe you have somebody I really like him I think you have something there you know coups money and grumble played better it's just it's a feeling out process here to things that probably won't change you won't be consistent three points shooting team and you're going to be out rebounded\nNow what is your game plan as you move forward because in the west you're going to have to LeBron is going to have to have a game plan night in and I don't I don't think it's going to be like Cleveland where you just go out there and play\nAnd on most nights you're going to win because you're playing against inferior town that's not going to be the case out west doesn't mean they can't be a playoff team a top for seed maybe but what you saw last night\nI Would say get used to it they're going to be on either in Portland is a you know Portland is already a team they know what they have they got a great back court I'm so Portland playing at home I wasn't surprised at all\nI was surprised a little bit that uh they made it look ... maybe a little bit easier than I thought they would but LeBron played well a hard played well you had some moments there but it's going to be an uneven right here and it's going to be a roller coaster ride for quite some time [noise] Broncos roll over the cardinals and I don't know who is worse than the ...\nI was surprised that uh as much as I was the ineptitude of that off influence and Josh Rosen this is where you just you're going to have battled scores here\nBut you don't want to have ... you know P. T. as the when the season is over where all of a sudden you're going which has happened here and this is usually what happens with young quarterbacks\nThat are drafted high when they get a chance to play he shouldn't be playing\nIn my opinion sand Bradford should be\nAnd I do think that that's what they were trying to do is get sand Bradford to play the entire season and Josh Rosa mostly going to play at all\nI don't know buffalo expected or one of Josh Alan ...\nBut you know they've had to use you know he's out for a couple of weeks and you know it's probably a good thing for him to eight seven seven three D. P. show email address GPA Adem Patrick dot com the final lower or we will have Melissa Etheridge the a great singer songwriter guitarist\nAnd we brought this up a couple of days ago about Brad Pitt learning how to fly fish for the movie a river runs through it and print she reached out to Melissa Etheridge is people she tweeted today that she had the people have been asking her this question based off of our show\nSo much is going to join us to talk about that also I saw where a should do the anthem at limbo she called limbo yummy is that right Percy she did yummy he had a very pleasant experience even though she's a Kansas City chiefs now she is but her primary home Packers fan okay for the library going All right\nSo ... I wouldn't describe ...\nI I think it's awesome but I ... [noise]\nIf I was going to attach descriptive words yummy would not come to mind for limbo trying to think what would you say to him would be yummy\nYes ... when you get within about a hundred and fifty yards of limbo there was a smell in the era onions and beer and brought were hours and you could smell it do you think that's what she's talking about yes\nYeah see I don't think she's actually talking about taste at all\nI think like when you talk about say like the donut the best part of the donut is like that yummy jelly filling in the middle yeah because the full quote is a she says it was amazingly fun limbo field is historic\nIt's the heart of football it's the good yummy center of football because it's owned by your whole community and you feel it and he's talking she's not actually talking about how limbo field taste\nAll right All right I'm right there with her right there with her on that a cabinet in Michigan leads to solve this hour Hi Kevin\nHas gone down but\nWhen I tell you right now when I when I ... I'm going to run a plane and fly over all the major universities and so Chris on a hundred dollar bills out for those poor uh for college athletes\nThat are being paid like they should [laughter]\nBut that is why I called um we're always fast and the NC double A.\nAnd I don't understand why they're always talk about they do a lot wrong but this is all driven by the NBA they're the ones that stopped allowing she has to be dropped out of high school and weren't willing to work or doing anything on there there and\nWhy don't they go back to draft inches out of high school and maybe add like a third round that's for the daily and so are the ... sorry so now you've got kids that can get paid right of high school and suddenly you also got kids who maybe were on the edge of being drafted can go to the ... going to a career that you know that salary they've been talking about a hundred and twenty five grand a year\nRight well thank you Kevin ... I Hope that they come up with some modifications here and I I Believe they will I think the one and done will be done but it'll take a couple more years before it is\nBut yeah I'm fine with never should have had it first place if you know the NBA doesn't want they're going to get the stars\nThey they just have to wait a year but they want them to be season when they get into the NBA I mean that's that's the great secret here in the NBA doesn't want an Eighteen year olds running around here because then the product is not good there was a time when you had kids coming out of high school and the product wasn't good\nLike the these kids weren't ready to play as an Eighteen or Nineteen year old they likely you'd spend one year in college and then you come in but then you have a little
