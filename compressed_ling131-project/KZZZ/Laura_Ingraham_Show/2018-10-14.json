beyond incompetence arc or the book has many many instances where we're getting into the area of unprecedented unheard of bizarre unique and it's because of these revelations\nThat the media did not see the media was seen what they expected to see what they expected to see was competent prosecutors taking care of business they didn't see what it was actually in front of them now that they're seeing the American people are seeing what actually happened during this trial this is why the word of mouth on outrageous I set up shop the number one\nSure a clerk obviously at the beginning of the case not yet a slam dunk right right right um do you think any point during the case she realized what did you never realize that it was becoming less and less slam dunk is they went along\nWell you know I was down there but by everyone I've spoken to near the end they were very very worried and they would have settled for a hung jury at the end but at the beginning you're right uh she thought I was a slam dunk case right but not at the end not at the end\n... garden as except to blame for that whole love right pretty much a is a totally whose fault or should Clark Sam steward in his face and said no\nWalk Clark was the chief prosecutor and the co prosecutor was touched Darden\nA clock knew about what was going to happen she apparently was opposed to it but not enough to say no you can't do this if she had intervened and said no\nYou're not going to do that it would not have happened\nHere's another area now of unbelievable incompetence we've everyone's talked in the country about the fact that even a first year law student is not going to conduct a serious experiment in court like this like a background you without knowing what the results going to be in advance and everyone knows that\nBut there's another aspect of that bluff demonstration that no one's talked about and I talk about it in the book that's perhaps even more incompetent and it goes it goes to the next issue\nThe first issue is you don't conduct the experiment unless you know what's gonna happen in advance\nThe second issue is if you do conduct the experiment how do you conduct it now it was the position of gardening park that even though those gloves had shrunk\nEven those Simpson was wearing latex gloves they still would have fit him if Simpson hadn't prevented the fed by the way he positioned his hands and fingers um\nWhen he was putting the gloves on in fact darn argued to the jury Simpson fake that he used the word Simpson fake that\nThose gloves are were extremely important pieces of evidence and as a prosecutor you don't turn over any evidence in any case to the defendant of all people in the face of this earth and have him tell you if there's a match obviously what you do it if if if you want to find out if there is a fit you have a third party\nPut the gloves on him feeling his hands and fingers along the way to make sure he doesn't do anything to inhibit the fifth let me give you a ... is not the best parallel but I think it goes straight to the point\nSay the police find a gun on someone's person or or are in their home and they suspected of murder weapon what they do of course they testify or the weapon and then they take the test fired bullets\nAnd they put it under a comparison microscope with the evidence bullets and see if the ... or markings on the test fired bullets match up all the evidence both said they don't turn the gun over to the defendant and tell him to conduct the test and report back to them that's absurd what what you had here and this may sound\nToo when I say it but I'm trying to be cuter sarcastic but this is in essence what you have here and it's unbelievable\nDarden give Simpson the gloves and in effect tell Simpson if these gloves fit you're in trouble if they don't fit you might be able to walk out of court and play golf know knowing that advanced that if these gloves don't fit you might be able to walk out of here tell us do they do these loves fit\nDarden literally turn the glowing throwing the Simpson and let him be incomplete charge and be the ones that decide if there's a fifth that's beyond incompetence are that's getting into\nArt and be the ones that decide if there's a fifth that's beyond incompetence are that's getting into the area of unprecedented on her to\nA you don't you don't make charges though beyond incompetence in other words you know\nAbsolutely not no no there are people that say well maybe they want us to lose there was a pay off or whatever no no no these are good people they wanted to win a but they just did not know how to try try a criminal case and and what I told you so far we're just touching the surface\n... right well let's let's go back to the beginning remember when they began to produce the domestic abuse or evidence right\nThere was a kind of a controversy about how much of that to present in I think that the prosecution got the sense that some jurors specific specifically ... brand them around for example seemed almost put off\nBy the domestic abuse testimony or you know the shaking of heads we couldn't see all of that apparently that was going on and so that convinced them to lay off that aspect\nThat may or may not be true and I don't hit them too hard in the book on that point although I certainly would have presented more domestic abuse evidence\nI Would have presented evidence for instance that a Simpson had stock they put no evidence of stocking up on it right that a Simpson that stock Nicole and her boyfriend she'd go to restaurants and he'd go to restaurants and set a couple of tables away and stare at them for a half hour you know I Would have put that on\nThere was evidence that he was carrying through the window observing her or doing things other men\nHe was following her around uh uh uh in her car he'd be behind her she was at Starbucks once with with a Ron Goldman and and a friend Ron Goldman said he pulls up ... the car very angry and tells her\nTo come over to the car orders are over to the car this was just a couple of months before the ... I think this would have been good evidence but that's not the main reason why I've been criticizing them for their handling of this case but I Do think they should have put on more domestic violence evidence\nOr on the jury seemed very impressed when they went to OJ's home aside from the ... the elegance of the home and all the rest of it but there ... there was the white robes and there was lots of white rug white ... and they seem very impressed that if there had been all this blood where it was the blood on the white wrote\nWhy should there be any blood at all why should there be any blood at all\nThe night of the murders this guy has blood in his bronco his car and as home when they interviewed him at at uh one thirty five PM the day after the murders this was before now this is before they withdrew any blood from his arm it would have had any opportunity to plant or sprinkle it\nThey said oh gee we got a problem here you've got blood in your bronco the driveway in your home how common and I like I told you he said he admits he said I caught myself last night I was bleeding how did you cut yourself okay these are the exact words I don't know okay\nWe're not we know we're not talking about ... neck or scratch you were talking about deep cuts to the ... middle finger and in fact it was ban is at the time they were interrogating him and he says he has no idea how he got that caught so what I'm saying is that right he admits he admits that around the very same top all around the very same time of these murders\nWe'd have to believe that Simpson innocently cut himself very badly on his left middle finger and I think our what we're talking about being a numbers here the astronomical probabilities against something like that happening or one out of five million one out of a million and when you cut yourself unless you're in a frantic frenzied state\nOr as he must have been in you stop the bleeding with your hand your handkerchief and you put on a fan if you don't need all over the place or so there was blood twenty five\n... of blood were taken from the Broncos there was another twenty stains that we're not even taken because they were representative\nAll there was nine blood drops on the driveway there were five in the ... one in the bathroom and if the juror said why wasn't there more why should there have been even one blood drop on the night of these murderous\nI recall some comment about going out to his bronco to fetch the cellular phone or something like that and he's already got cup when he did no no no that's what the media is at the bottom of the hour we'll be right back to you or it's called outrage is number one on the New York times best seller list you're going to want to\nRun run out and get it I Know you want this is a good book believe me we'll be right that was\nOkay now that again we get into absolute extreme or a or incompetence here\nUm the defense every time\nEvery time they made an argument to explain away and permanent enough evidence the propagation either did not respond at all which is virtually unprecedented or they responded in a very anemic fashion\nThe main pieces of evidence in this case other than that that tape that I just told you give me a hundred dollars and yellow pat I would've convicted him on that thirty minute interrogation along but the main item of evidence against them than with his blood was that the murders thing okay there was blood on the ... gate a which was also has found later though\nIrrigate a which was also his sound later though yeah no no no no it was collected later not found later no it was it was it was seen that night by five detectors all of whom would testify not collected the night\nAnd that was not collecting 'cause then is following the criminal list and he did not pick it up that night and things like that happen that just incompetence to use picking up blood everywhere I mean it was awash in blood there and he did not pick up the evidence from there again it would seem that night there was even a photograph of two to three blood stains that night taken by the LAPD that night\nNow they claimed that the stands on the ... gate were planted a talking about the defense aren't they claim that the glove at Rockingham was planted they claim that blood and the Broncos planted they claim that ... that the socks and Simpsons bedroom but we're we're a planet but even these defendants who\nI mean defense attorneys who possess the golden adds of ten thousand elephants even they even they did not have the guts to allege that the five blood drops in form which were immediately to the left or the killer's blood issue prince leaving the crime scene even they did not allege that they were planted here's what they alleged\nThe lives of those blood drops there were exposed to the elements and lost all of their DNA\nBecause most of the element\nBacteria sunlight what have you and later on when they were on a cotton swab teaches at FIT scientific investigation division of LAPD a pie protect\nThat those five blood drops became contaminated with blood from Simpsons reference while they had no proof of that no evidence but they said they the the\nFIT with a cesspool of contamination and possibly happen which is not that they had no evidence in any of that in any event\nMarsha Clark then did not come back and make two very very obvious arguments I'm no expert on DNA but I Know enough about DNA to tell you this\nThat that if if in fact if in fact there had been cross contamination and she didn't make these arguments those five blood drops would have had a BPA in them di di da\nIs an anti coagulating it's a preservative that is added to blood taken from a ... for a from a suspects are right but in the reference wild and they put ... these five blood Ross did not have the BPA in that she didn't tell the jury that inner summation it came out of the trial but she did not argue that in her final summation is true that\nThere could not have been cross contamination 'cause if there had been there would have been eating PA number two if there had been cross contamination of this is a separate independent reason why there was not cross contamination\nThe DNA would have been a lot higher on those five ... because uh if if the blood came from the if if the blood ... on those cotton swatch has actually at the DNA on those blood on the cotton swabs came from the reference vile there wouldn't have been any degradation at all\nWhereas the blood drops taken from the scene had in fact the greatest because the sunlight the moisture in the ... in fact only a PC our DNA tests was was conducted on for the blood drops and an R I felt the more precise type was conducted on the fifth so there had been degradation but if there was cross contamination\nAnd actually it was the blood from the reference vile there would have been no degradation and the DNA would have been very very high she didn't make these too obvious arguments so when I'm telling you is that every single time the defense made an argument to try to explain away or a ... evidence the ... response in time it was mind boggling incompetent\nMind boggling All right in the final some Asians are ... the race card was played obviously and um how do you do if you were to switch positions hard for you I'm sure right but would you have done that\nNo no no it's okay to vigorously defend someone even though you know that they're guilty of a crime you could vigorously defend them but\nYou don't fraudulently inject race into the case as these defense attorneys did you don't falsely accused innocent police officers of the conspiracy these defense attorneys know that Simpsons guilty and then and they know there was no frame of they have to know that so they went beyond the proper bounds of added a of advocacy they went way beyond that\nSo far that somebody ought to be taken to the bar\nWell I'm not going to say that because this type of thing happens in court as it happens in court and and and lawyers are given tremendous latitude in court but I I don't think it was ethical at all\nBut you would you do what you have to do\nWell ah some lawyers do and and these dead and I thought they were an ethical but whether it's grounds for intervention by the bar or not I don't know\nUm I thought he was guilty I still think that he was guilty I always thought so however right at one time at one point during the trial\nA when there was a motion to suppress ... do the little tiny spot of blood zone in the bronco initially and then jumping the fence I saw the\nMotion should have succeeded or do you have any comment on the\nWell I don't think so both the judges are Kathleen Paul Kennedy at the perimeter and hearing and Ito at the trial\nKathleen Paul Kennedy at the lunar hearing and Ito at the trial ruled that The Simpsons Fourth Amendment rights were not violated um\nWhat what what you had here is rocking ... only about two miles away from Bundy and these are the the the place that he picked this felt that it almost looked like an extension of the of of of the crime scene they go there\nAnd they find a dot of blood spot of blood above the door handle a ... on the bronco\nThat that alone is not enough to go over the fence but here here's the additional evidence and circumstances that the judges felt\nConstitute a sufficient cause to go over the fence without a search warrant\nA they had been told the detective vi west that that's the Security Agency that worked for Simpson right that there was a a a a living made they've been told that they live in may now they went to the phone they called inside the residents they also rang entered calm at the gate Noone answered inside\nEven though there was supposed to be living made their lights on inside the house there were two cars in the driveway\nAnd those circumstances are called exit Gen x engine circumstance and justifying going over the wall because they're maybe someone might be dead or hurt that needs immediate attention now once they got over the wall and solve blood on the driveway and in the ... then of course Simpson became a suspect that point\nHe was a suspect only in a in a generic sense that when a wife or former wife is murdered the husband of former husband there immediately people that detectives are routinely check out\nWhat that was a close call though well it may have been a close call I\nHave to point before they jumped ... cents yeah\nBut there were quite a few things and the cans of them that some someone maybe inside a who needs help because with the lights on and two cars in the driveway and they're supposed to be living made how come no one's answering the phone\nCheryl sure All right judge Ito a right to your comments on judge Ito through the trial was he a duty bend over to foreign backwards was he afraid I'm an appeals ruling a that would overturn everything\nI think all judges are afraid of that I think he was democratic or in his incompetence but he was trying to he was very conscious need any try conscientious and he tried to be fair to both sides\nYou made some terrible rulings or perhaps his worst ruling was allowing the defense to get into the race issue a bus far the defense attorneys have gotten all the blame from the American people\nAre on injecting race into the case and they they deserve all the blame that they're getting and then some ... Ito prior to my book has gotten a free ride on this issue he doesn't get a free ride in my book I blame in one hundred percent\nFor allowing this case to turn into a racial case and the reason I Do is that he allowed the defense attorneys to do it and he should have done that under three fifty two of the California evidence code if the relevance of evidence offered in this case we're talking about whether affirmative use the N word right in the past ten years right that relevance\nIs substantially outweighed by the probability of prejudice the opposing side you keep it out and hear the relevance of ferment using the N. word in the past ten years was extremely remote at best I mean that's a non factor\nAny broad jump of Olympian proportions to conclude that just because someone has used the N. word or even as a racist that they're going to go round framing innocent people murder\nBut the probability of prejudice for the prosecution was more than the requisite substantial was monumental so under three fifty to the evidence code you should have kept it out it was an egregiously pour ruling on his part after he ruled that way as you know the ... tapes surface\nSure and it changed the complexion of the entire trial if you know didn't want to follow the law if you want the ... uh uh at the law common sense common sense which she had precious little of throughout this entire trial would have dictated to him that you don't allow the defense to do that\nSingle day thousands of white police officers arrest or investigate black suspects does anyone really believe that when these thousands upon thousands of cases come to court that's\nPerfectly proper to ask every one of these officers maybe ever used the N. word and it'd be the ... and you can show we did have a separate satellite trial on that issue which is exactly what happened in the fermentation that's absurd on his face you know was off base here in the prosecution had to pay for those sins but even with the bad ruling by Ito\nOr you will fare [noise] do you have the beach [noise]\nDo you have plumage\nPlease tell me you answered no which means you need to get a fishing licence and have your boat register because it helps local conservation efforts protected very natural resources you enjoy boating and fishing in generations to come to your heart at take me fishing dot org\nDistance historian Daniel who was born two months nearly his lungs weren't ready his heart wasn't ready his parents could only hope that one day he would leave the hospital healthy and they would all live happily ever after\nDaniel is just one more than five hundred thousand stories of babies born prematurely last year new can help them march of dimes premature birth and bring more babies home how she learned how and march of dimes dot com working together for stronger healthier babies\n\nTowards the germs and beyond\nDuring the rally at eastern Kentucky university the president also shared his condolences for those impacted by hurricane Michael\nI dealt with our fellow citizens in Florida\nNorth Carolina South Carolina and Virginia [noise]\nThey got our\nSenate majority leader in Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell also think this party on confirming now justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nThe rally caps off a busy day for the president who welcome to recently breed American pastor Andrew Brunson and his wife nor rain in the oval office Saturday Brunson was arrested on terrorist related allegations and spent nearly two years in detention\nMaria was unbelievable [laughter] she was going to call I guess I don't really love your limits [laughter]\nCalling and she wanted you out\nA Turkish court convicted Brunson other charges but credit at the time he had already served towards the sentence so he could leave the country the Florida Panhandle is just beginning a long road to recovery after hurricane Michael made landfall Wednesday boxes Jonathan series says it's hard to venture anywhere\nDriving it still treacherous in storm ravaged areas you could see debris scattered around the roads the traffic lights are on but that's only because they're being powered by an emergency generator the rest of the neighborhood has no electricity statewide two hundred sixty thousand customers without power\nPresident Trump plans to visit the area next week this is Fox News\nThis is the Cyrus time ...

I expected more out of you blah blah blah you want to respond to that\nWas the ...\n... well no no no way to those it's from James in Seattle\nSeems in Seattle yeah well he said that man's and uh they did not participate in these murders a Hitler wasn't that off with either but but Manson was the architect of the conspiracy to commit these murders he was convicted of nine murders is believed to be responsible for thirty five\nAnd I say thirty five because the Manson Family claims to have off the o F T the I'm thirty five people ah I've always refer to Manhattan is a very evil sophisticated con man someone who knows man and a lot better than I Do because he lived with Manson\nSaid a Charlie uh uh a death death is Charlie's trip death is Charlie strip\nOr he wanted to murder as many people as he could have if he'd had an opportunity you would not have stopped uh\nWhat is in saying the interviews now the charges they left the best part of him on the cutting room floor\nOh no well that there was a little\nOr to him on the cutting room floor oh no well\nThat there was a little at a team of the um of the interview that he had with Geraldo end with Tom Schneider years ago but but a man for himself has said you know that he'd murder as many people as he could have he denies complicity in these murders obviously 'cause he wants to be set free\nBut he has said more than once if you had an opportunity he'd murder fifty million people so apparently this guy doesn't know what's coming out of ... about Manhattan can charm people just like OJ Simpson cat\nBut he's an evil sophisticated con man who wants his hero who is a hero man says\nYou know Hitler Hitler he said that Hitler was a tuned in guy what level the karma the Jews that Hitler had the right answer for everything you know so this James I don't think he knows up\nI don't think he knows what he's talking about yes Manson did not participate in these murders which made it a little bit more difficult to convict him I had to bring it bring him in ... by way of circumstantial evidence by showing that only he had the motive for these murders\nThat he controlled these people that they never would have committed these murders without his direction and guidance\nBut he's the one that ordered these murders and\nGives you a different man today well he affect me four letters a ... since Nineteen Seventy two Manson is very intelligent and he speaks in rentals um but there's usually some underlying underlying message the last letter I got about two years ago was just hopelessly garbled I could make heads or tails of at\nA time when one more here I Would like to ask a sin as written a RINO\nWhy you consistently humans and oppose the release of Leslie ... one of the three girls I'm acquainted acquainted with Leslie old friend of my wife also north parents blah blah blah blah and um apparently a her father now in the seventies tells me he's vowed to live to see his daughter free even if he has to make it to a hundred and twenty\nMhm well if anyone gets out obviously a it should be left me for the simple reason that she was not involved in the five tape Margaret she's been convicted of right who murders but not the seven murders that the others and Manson of course it's been convicted of nine\nAh Lesley then how may be rehabilitated but I don't know I you know uh uh I forget the girl's name the lady's name I'm\nDiane ... Diane Sawyer or have had a special right on the the girls in Nineteen Ninety\nFive I think are in Nineteen Ninety four and they made a good at ... impression because millions around the country saw them and they formed the conclusion that these are\nFemale defendants or had been rehabilitated that's assume art for the sake of argument that these girls are rehabilitate that this will never do it again or I'm not in any position to make any attachment of that I haven't seen them personally in since Nineteen Seventy one\nWhere people are are are not thinking clearly here is that they're assuming that when you're rehabilitated you're entitled to be set free is if that's the only reason why we incarcerate people certainly that's one of the reasons we put people behind bars\nYou know a lot of the main reason you know there's punishment\n... yeah there's two other reasons one one is punishment off and when we talk about punishment we're talking about justice I mean people say justice is fine but retribution as bad you know that's prehistoric or whatever it is but how can you have justice without retribution\nJustice is just a huge mess euphemistic way of saying retribution and punishment there is another reason why we put people behind bars and probably the main reason if deterrence\nTo set an example that's right we we put people behind bars we punish them to tell the prospect of criminals that if you violate the law you're going to be punished\nDocuments that were on a time listening when one last question should Shirley Manson ever see the light of day\nAbsolutely often present no he was sentenced to death\n[laughter] [noise]\nThat's a good answer she wishes she had known about all the things that really don't matter at all [noise]\nAll right we're going to take calls and we're going to do open lines I Want to remind everybody this Friday night Saturday morning Richard Hogan is going to be here\nThat should be a a quite a program indeed all the news from Japan also eight thousand people are now ill seven dead it's all across Japan it's ... and they have no idea where the hell it's coming from\nIt's to the point now where parents are keeping their children home\nIt's some sort of strain of vehicle ally and the scientists that's far don't even have a ... people are talking about two and cooked meat\nThat may turn out to be at but good right now they don't know they have no idea thousands of people getting very many on the critical list you have no idea how serious this is I Want to thank the caller for a wedding and I'm Sorry I couldn't get to your earlier or are you are now on the air Hi\nHi I'm Wayne Santa Barbara highway in art when I say I really appreciate your show and you get your lifestyle and everything out of my question is about a jet that went down Yes sir it seems to me that if it really was a terrorist or something like a planet of uh\nTo me that if it really was a terrorist or someone who planted a bomb\nOr they wouldn't have that the climate so to speak or would have gone up over over the water\nWell now remember that this flight a was late by an hour this flight should have been um should be in about an hour farther out into the Atlantic\nExactly my point um that that would have gone off without any real witnesses or any rate that's right and I think that ah someone who was trying to blow the plane up and make them sort of a statement would have had that happen you know on the ground in front of\nMy you know what I think I I'm beginning to think the FBI believes it was a missile they're all over Long Island right now checking with people renting boats and all the rest of it now why would they be doing that the only thing you can do to an airplane from motives fire shoulder fired missiles that's it\nWell like bigger point certainly I Hope that that black box wind surfing and give them some information\nI think a better question is whether it already has surfaced\nA but all the people who\nI I hate to be suspicious I really do because I Want to trust our government but uh I frankly a it was singing then all of a sudden no more paintings well one good reason you wouldn't have any more ... there is nothing down there to paying\nWell we could follow and see what happens to the life of the people who were witnesses who feel they thought flare or a missile lot\nWell we should thank you very much the testimony that I find most credible of all our two military pilots according to ABC who were on a commercial flight and watched a missile rise to flight eight hundred\nNow that's tough testimony to refute now where did the missile come from I don't know a terrorist in a boat\nI'm a U.S a live fire an exercise of some kind you would think we certainly know about that by now I after all depended on a bunch of nowhere and when they fired missiles that should not be a mystery at this juncture should it\n\nIs something rotten in Denmark or more appropriately off the Long Island shore something's wrong here west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHello right Yes sir I think the government knows what happened\n[noise] I don't want to believe that um I I Know a lot of people there's even people out there right now are saying the government did it um I'm not one of those people and I don't want to believe that and I don't believe that really that they did it now do they know what really happened yes and I think it's entirely possible that they know what\nHappened now there are you I understand they're not going to release to the public\nOr information into their reasonably sure until they've got good evidence in hand but last far away the um the public statements I even at the highest level even up at ... at his level they're all mixed up\nAnd it's not exactly inspiring confidence in people like Mike me I don't know about you while hardline you're on\nThe air hello hello yes or a turn your radio off please yeah okay now tell us where you're calling from a caller from Galveston Island in the Gulf of Mexico you almost on Texas Yes sir of course I'll go ahead oh well sure we don't screen calls turn your radio off\nOkay I'm Sorry I uh have got the answer in a roundabout way but I don't want to get off into the Gulf War I'd rather talk about this a missile launch from an ultralight airplanes\nTowards the towards the eight eight hundred flight now why are you saying all ...\nWell because I was a pilot Nineteen forty seven and I've been flying out the lights the last few years because I lost my license out the light as they only air frame that you can fire a shoulder mounted stinger missile from because of the exhaust system if he tried to fire one from a conventional airplane\nYou would fill the cockpit journal where you were and we're sure complete\nAt this early started this thing that was a pilot a policeman from New York and his wife were flying just about dark\nOver this beach area and they had they had come back and landed and they were being interviewed by CNN I Believe mhm and CNN and ask a question well did you see any other airplanes\nAnd it caught my era immediately when this pilot said that no we didn't see any planes at all except an ultralight\nNow the ultralight an avid their lights on it right and they all their life is a uh as I said they only platform you could fire a stinger missile from\nGenerally don't fly ultra lights or at night do they not\nPeople generally don't fly ultra lights or at night do they\nNot unless there are terrorists wanting some vehicle that they could launch on the air to air missile\nWhen you're up three or four thousand feet or alter light it becomes an air to air missile ... rather than a surface to air missile right I'll call this end of it to the FBI but of course you never get any feedback from anybody\nBut them that I heard two ladies there were three interviews with telephone people are on the beach\nTo out of these three people initially now are all getting hit the feedback that there was a bright light and then that an explosion or the bright light at eight thousand feet which is a lot of confusion there too\nThat really it goes back to some vehicles saying it was some say it was a thousand and I'm hearing figures up to Thirteen thousand now which is it\nWell I heard that playing last night that radar or the icon went off with a number on it and then they rate played the radar thing and there are national blast was that eight thousand that they watched four pieces of wreckage fall for twenty five seconds\nThat they they claim they saw that the plane was was dropped from Thirteen thousand to eight thousand from from the cars that can measure it on the radar\nAnd the plane was trying to be recovered they said I don't do except that they they don't have any voice recorder unless they do have are they're not telling us and the plane then\nOf part at eight thousand feet on the other for the four sections still shaped seen on the ... trade or when they replay the tapes show that crashing into the ocean twenty five seconds later on I just heard that last night\nYes are All right well look a thank you I I I'm telling you folks\nIt is impossible and they have almost made it impossible to intelligent we discuss the facts of this case\nThey have so muddied the waters with regard to the altitude of the airplane with regard to the descriptions of the explosion with regard to a hundred witnesses talking about something headed up toward that airplane\nUm with regard to there is forensic evidence um uh regarding um a trek chemical race or there isn't there's hanging or there isn't there was a major fine with a hundred bodies trapped inside or there isn't\nThat it's almost impossible they have so\nFond of this whole case with um ... ... ... ... facts that it's almost getting hard to talk about\nBut I again I come back to to military pilots who were on a commercial aircraft and testified it was a missile now that's professional\nHigh quality I Witness testimony and and then you may recall that a a day afterwards we were talking about um is remember that and they said no no we have now confirmed\nIt is not a missile and then a day later opposite well maybe it is a missile again\nWill damage which is it a another words is a ... at this point is a missile a possibility probability or not and we get both answers I don't know what to make of that [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very
