P. turkey story times ten\n'em all I can tell you is a lot lies ahead\nOne of the larger or largest I guess no larger pieces of whale blubber blown to smithereens came down right on top of the car of a guy named wall\nSo we were able to fortunately get down to that were kind of keeping people back but but the vernacular\nYou get down to that were kind of keeping people back but but the vernacular than the Appalachian guy knew Wilbur quite well and we were able to go right down there to to actually where the way I was in the smell you couldn't believe the smell of this thing I don't know how long this thing with that but it came ashore and and uh it was just it was just awful\nIt was on its way very very rare that\nSomebody in the night before had taken the chains on cut the lower jaw to get the teeth I understand the teeth are hybrid\nOh no kidding\nYeah somebody had ripped off the the whole jaw\nSo's mutilated twenty John Wayne [laughter]\nSo we were kinda sooner on air and shouting around there and they have the people there from the highway to firemen and we were all kind of talking together and you know I said well what are you going to do and and a fellow that from our way to find me as well because I'm a blow it up I thought well you know okay not a problem\nThat we've been through a while longer and all of a sudden\nThis caterpillar tractor comes rumbling down across the fan with a with a huge bucket on the front of it in the bucket with twenty cases the sixty percent power\nEven though I think about and I thought\nBoy this is this going to be big trouble so I said to this guy says why the hell are you going to do with twenty cases with dynamite yeah he does I'm On a blow it out to sea and I thought\nYeah you're going to blow it up to the actors and I says where are you ever come up with this formula and he says he talked to somebody and they said rule of thumb case a dynamite predominant well that's what your\nOwn of whale yeah that's what that was the formula now I Wonder if they might have derived from actually per ton of rock that you want to display on I have no idea I mean how would you calculate away and\nHe says I'm On a day on the ... and we'll put the case of direct I'm going to blow a mile to see well powder doesn't work that way and and uh I got into quite a\nWhile you might say almost an argument about I just like you're crazy you're going to kill somebody like was you know if you want to obliterate the way they want to blow up a big rock with dynamite you would have to stick to dynamite on the top and put some sand on top of your crack it\nYou never go underneath this nicely with fan because than to go down to the old power you have is going to go straight up\n... anyhow vernacular and Wilbur said somebody come on I'm going to operate says it's really none of your business and me how am I says yeah and he says and the guy down the highway department he says he how he says that I Want to have everybody on top of them do up there\nAnd I I'm ... I'm I'm just curious on how did you know so much or I mean I I have had\nQuite a bit of experience with it or even in the military with with the flow explosives\nAnd so he says I might have everybody on top of those dunes out there and I was yeah and I'm going to be the further if that will be on the south Hampton\n[laughter] and I really\nWant Vernon turning went with me and everybody went way down to south end of this thing\nAnd they made a you know kind of a a big spectacle they put the dynamite in there and run around with a real a wire and then they waved their hard hats for the all clear lake fickle one another and what have you\nAnd let me tell you they touched that soccer off and it looked like a nuclear explosion\nOr you just see the hay fields you'll know what I say\nI was reminded of a fuel air explosion or some short of a or near a nuclear explosion it was unbelievable\nYeah it was a huge mushroom cloud and the thing was red and black and white and just\nUnbelievable and the big pieces of course went on the on the mushroom cloud they kind of went way up higher and all of these people you have to visualize a hundred people are more than on top of the dome and the court the wind comes in from the ocean but the\nThe ... knows well yes it does that and all of a sudden everybody realized oh\nGod [laughter] in other words they were blown to such a high altitude the wind began to grab on\nThis stuff started moving them and people started screaming and running and smell you couldn't you'll never\nFully even smell or you know I understand actually before they began running right after the explosion everybody for at least a few moments rejoice in my opinion it was fun yeah ... ... it was like how to make a fair fourth of July times ten\nYeah but but here calm and I mean to tell you and we were the first one is down and it was starting to hit us all ready and and I was standing there and I look up and I the one big piece and they were just kind of\nFloating around up there and listen to round up their way up there ...\nIt just came to an absolute ... stop yeah and it's great to sell while to get my site I came\nBig teeth and they were just kind of floating around up there and look around up their way up there ... it just came to an absolute ... ... yeah and it's great to help out the good my site\nI came to strike down there was like a road runner cartoon hits my card debt Senate your car and I just bought this Ninety eight old with a goal for door ready to say you know\nAnd the people I bought it from with Donald vulgar bill and Eugene here and their slogan by the way of the whale of a deal [laughter] [laughter] that thing and it hit my car with such force yet it exploded\nThere wasn't a piece of glass bigger than a quarter of an inch\nOh my God and it pushed the roof so\nHard down to the flat\nPart of their feet that you see that and and just kind of paying for the call I don't want this piece weighed probably four or five hundred pound\nI saw the photo of your car a walled in yeah I presume they declared it a total loss\nBut yeah so I fortunately nobody was there I mean they were breaking the story of funny is because the car next to mine had some little children that uh-huh so the story is funny because nobody really got hurt at this point\nIt sort of hit that other people were screaming and running and I don't know I'm sure all their clothes were road [laughter] you know this and there's no way they get the smell out of that\nUm it even I guess you know the camera crew which could have stayed in place bravely like those under fire decided valor was better I every body yeah and they just stopped taking pictures and took off\nThe so I got down there that people got to my car first before because we were the first ones found that\n... that's right and you said you'd be the farthest away\nThe guy from the everybody come cheap arrived with with all these hard hat official don't my God the\nCars that well it's mind UFO base yeah they said well come on our office I I'm not going to your office I'm going to call it governor governor or I couldn't get a hold of\nThe governor of but I got a hold of the ... the guy that run the highway can make and then I started telling them the story and he says I got to stop pieces you got to tell me he says that anybody get hurt and I said no because I have to stop I have this he said this is the funniest story I ever heard in my life\n[laughter] well is there any way that you know\nOther than what you told us about the decision making this somehow I mean you figure this gets turned over to the highway department and you know the guys these guys out of their dynamite and things aren't true and I know they start chewing it over trying to figure out how to get rid of this whale and I just really would like to know how they came to the decision to blow it up\nThat I don't have any idea how they came to that decision but uh the the the\nTape that the San Francisco news channel did they interviewed quite a few people on on the tape and and uh they said the written report that this fellow wrote that everything went according to plan\nAnd then they said what happens when you're in a bureaucracy when everything goes according to a planet then six months later he got promoted\nHe got promoted [laughter] you know there's this sort of a thread you say that was twenty five years ago huh yea it still seems to work that way today we're\nIt's worse than the ... you know\nRight after this happened maybe a year after I got a call from Sports Illustrated really I was living in Louisville than mhm and they want to know you know if I had any objections to them doing this story on this will and I 'cause I have no objection to the all the other fellow he worked on it\nI still have a copy of it somewhere\nAnd he called me it was midnight in Louisville and he called me from you Jane and he said he had just come back from farms are or wherever this George lip and he says I have to tell you what he said and I say as well as typical bureaucrat he says\nI didn't use enough powder more dynamite or wouldn't have any\n[laughter] All right it is the bottom of the hour walk hold on a when we come back I've done a couple more questions for you and I've got the channel to rendition it'll do what he does labor labor\nWe'll be right back to this is premier network was art bell hosting goes to goes a long somewhere in time [noise]\nConfident that it'll work the only thing is we're not sure ...\nYou also had been standing nearby all day I was everything was being made right who asked George thought on the highway engineer in charge of the project for his final observations\nConfident that it'll work the only thing is we're not sure just exactly how much are explosives it'll take to disintegrate this\nThing's so the scavenger seagulls and crabs and what not seen it up\nIs there any chance that might be more than one day job [noise]\nUh if there's any large chunks last and um [noise]\nWe may have to do some other clean up possibly set another charge\nDynamite was buried primarily on the ... side of the big mammals as most of the remains will be blown toward the sea about Seventy five bystanders most of them residence went first found the well to be an object of curiosity before they tiring of its smell\nWere moved back a quarter of a mile away the sand dunes there were covered with spectators inland lover newsman\nCharlotte has become a land of blubber news now with a blast blasted lover beyond all believable about\nWhat's going on now on the screen\nIs a countdown sin nine eight seven six five four three two one [noise]\nOur cameras stop rolling immediately after the blast the humor of the entire situation suddenly gave way to run for survival is huge chunks of weld lover everywhere\nPieces of meat past high over our heads while others were falling that are the the new ones were rapidly evacuated and spectators escape close to falling debris and the overwhelming smell\nA parked car over a quarter of a mile from the blast site was talking to one large chunk the passenger compartment literally smash fortunately no human was hit as badly as the car over everyone on the scene was covered with small particles of Dan Quayle\nAs for the success of the effort on the seagulls who were supposed to clean things up we're nowhere in sight either scared away by the explosion or kept away by the smell\nThat didn't really matter the remaining chance we have such a size that no respectable Segal would attempt to tackle anyway as darkness began to set in the highway prove or back on the beach burying the remains including a large piece in the ... which never left the blast site\nIt might be concluded that should've whale ever wash ashore on lane county again those in charge will not only remember what to do is they'll certainly remember what not to do [laughter]\nSo uh [laughter] that\nWas a report um Walt I'm I just want to give them one more little plug here and then it's back to you you look at this report has only a at one other time in all it's twenty five year history been released to anybody to run and that was too I think Kay geo in\nSan Francisco that did a piece on it and so I feel very honored that I'm Katie you allowed us to run it\nOr they're very nice people up there in Portland and once again you can see it for yourself the video that goes with the report if you're in Portland it'll be Wednesday November first in their newscast at five PM and six and a six thirty and then to Lebanon as well\nWith the series airing a Thursday and friday November second and third at five six thirty and eleven so don't miss it and I'm thanks to Doug Brazil the news director and everybody else at K. A. T. you it was a rare opportunity and I'm Glad we could\nProvide it for you well wall there it was a sound familiar you don't want\nTo always puzzled me about this it's a known fact that if if you get onto the underneath the bureaucrats and get them all upset about something you usually get an IRS\nAudit what I never could understand that I was the only one who protested what this guy was doing how the hell he ever directed that piece of the way over the top of my car but he did it\nDid you get audited no no um did they promptly pay up I mean you hate me and today in two days I gotta\nI gotta check it today I think what they were really afraid of this thing it really made the newspapers and they wire service and I had people from Germany than me the new papers relatives I have over there\nAnd I think what the what they were afraid of is probably all these people could have them ... at least for a new car\nWe got home we had a rent a car to go home and yes\nAnd we had and it was cold we have to have the ... all the windows down all the way home that's how bad it was\nNow and when you are an African\n... not living up anymore with a hell of a guy with both funny because he went in the garage and his wife go out and she made him ... make\nAs a garage\nThe script make it as a garage did not let him out of the [laughter]\nI'm now that you know looking back this and is obviously you can laugh but on the day that it actually happened did you did people at that moment see really see the humor in this or I'm I'm Talking about the group that was actually there and had all this stuff on on them they probably weren't laughing it\nWasn't funny at all and then it's absolutely amazing that no one was seriously injured\nI mean and that's what I tried to tell if died when he was doing a ... and and and the important commissioner Martin told me it was not on my then I look I going to kill somebody [laughter] you know and and that as as luck has it turned out to be a funny story but thank God\nOr indeed want I Would like to submit a just a few moments of questions from listeners this is such a famous story that I thought I'd let you take a couple of calls you willing to do that or\nI don't know what people would ask a it's all pretty self explanatory but we can find out east of the Rockies you're on the air with well I'm an offer\nA hello there Hi Hi where

one and only a few more moments with them um west of the Rockies you're on the air with wall almond hopper high\nOr while I was actually not call me a question that regarding the oil I was a crime to get a holy if I could ask you a couple of other things\nWell then you have to do that after our guests are a wildcard line to you're on the air with long arm and a half or high\nYeah a quick comment first or do you know this the first time that this isn't the first time something like this has happened I think I think it was done one before ... northern California when I was in college in Nineteen Seventy eight uh my professor told us about if the northern California where they tried to blow up\nSame kind of thing where they tried yeah it's been um it just kinda splattered he said it wasn't quite as a\nQuite a big show with what happened up in Oregon this guy splattered all over the place of the main carpet the left\nHas anybody I'm I'm I'm curious um anybody come up with an actual good way to dispose of a well I saw at the end they sort of buried it in the sand\nI think that's what they did in this case to it's just no it's an impossible situation\nIn other words whales don't what'd you say that while the whales don't really well I I blew up part of it blew up and there was so much of it last\nI think better than half of what was going back\nThen whales don't blow up easily [laughter] I'm not a\n... a first time caller line you're on the air with want a Ahmed another\nHigh John from Milwaukee yes\nA hernia red shirt and your turn your radio officer oh turn your

whole or something like that now somebody else Thompson\n[laughter] eased of the Rockies you're on the air with wall Oppenheimer high\nAlright how you doing wrong good well now what about the environmental all this guy's going crazy because someone bought oil\nWell they would now believe me biologist and everybody and they weren't screaming holy that that was back in the day we went back in the good old days let's put it that way today they would probably scream bloody murder you know big protests when someone blow up oil no\nNo no bear in mind this will have ... as Russia would say assumed room temperature due to the point where it was hard to stay in the vicinity so I guess that's your answer\nWhere are you sir uh where where in Houston, Texas Houston All right yeah and I'm

the very end at a couple of paragraphs not like Reuters or the other why is it that the people in London which have nothing to do with this country directly have gotten the full story on this stuff they have a ...\nPage and the times of London devoted to the story in today's edition authority out here we already have facts copies of it the London telegraph that's the full story out\nOr do you feel that if the Associated Press picked it up properly that's word will use prominently that then the a larger networks would have no choice but to follow on\nWell I think that it would've been more likely that the networks would have followed with the story there's a herd and thank you search the press is one of the lead news item but it's really not\nTheir job to determine what the American people should or shouldn't know they should be reporting knows if a\nPractice with three experts here that came in and gave their opinion or one of the world's pre eminent handwriting experts came into this country\nKind of the doctor leave handwriting yeah mhm uh well actually er he has a lot less\nBaggage and Dr Lee or frankly and he's not and I'm On my doctor league um he except that he asked for no fee\nTo do this or an hour\nOh now that's interesting ah so so in other words the there could be no other uh external motivation other than trying to get to the truth well\nThe funny thing is I'm Dr all to knew very little about the case I mean he's been hearing a lot about it today and he's quite a shock sure about it but he looked at it just as a matter of looking at the snow and comparing the two of dumping documents that foster is known to have written\nAnd he said that it's not a match it it was a it was a forgery and you can see how the ...\nWrote the documents because the Ford you\nNever know how someone exactly right how their stroke well\nAll right hold it right there where the bottom of the hour we'll be right back with Chris Ruddy\nAnd we'll show you how to get hold of the Associated Press\nIs premier network that was our grill hosting goes to goes a long ... somewhere in time\nAnd they were shown how many fingers had come in contact different piece of paper Mr but we said his statement the fact that they had no fingerprint for only ... bumping papers is consistent with the person toward having more gloved\n[noise] [noise] so it's a forgery so we've got a gigantic stories so the Associated Press now you give me what you can I Know this is touchy territory Chris letter\nThe eight page today\nAnd to know where that they were going to do a dispatch may have been you know a short story but it would be a story\nAnd when people were calling out the ... yeah we did it we're doing it or we did it when we find out what did it meant was to paragraph three paragraph at the end of a very long article on white water and Senate hearing\nUm which is a typical way of burying district here they're talking about all these things going on with Pina's and I think by the way three experts are saying that the notice a forgery which is like you know sort of thing you know riding on the news after the day the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima you know talking about what happened between the Yankees\nAnd the White Sox and thing by the way at the end of that story you know there was a bomb dropped on Hiroshima\nAnd you know just patently ridiculous\nSo that was Frank okay so what happened de da de do we're\nTold that a that this decision was made at the highest levels of the a P uh\nWithin that that that story would be run this way right now we're going to do a story\nThat the the AP reporter was frustrated he was not allowed to write one and um\nThis administration has a very close relationship with the Associated Press and very rarely does stories get on the eight people are that are critical of this administration I mean even Clinton I'm making comments about flip flopping on taxes\nAgain that was a story that the Reuters writer wrote a piece didn't carry that\nThis is got to bring it to critical mass now I'm going to do it I just confirmed the number I don't just give out numbers without confirming a them I'm going to give the audience the Washington Associated Press bureau number\nA there should be outrage the audience should be aware if you call it in all probability they're going to say well\nWe ran it just as Chris told you they will say but it was very they ran it they rented so that it well almost wouldn't be read and that's\nOutrageous this is a gigantic stories so the Washington Associated Press bureau number is\n... area code two zero to\nSeven seven six nine four zero zero\nI mean read that again area code too old to\nSeven seven six Ninety four hundred anybody out there who feels this is an outrage or should have that number and it's good uh what Chris twenty four hours a day\nYeah twenty four hours a day there's people at Eighteen answering the phone and certainly they're open the the public has a right to lead Eighteen no if they feel something newsworthy they want to hear about it no one ever said they couldn't call\nI rarely if ever do this kind of thing ah Chris but damn it all this is a really big story and if it takes pressure\nI'm so that a bind tomorrow morning you know the guy is telling his boss who's telling his boss hey boss we're starting to get a lot of pressure on this forgery story um maybe we'd better sit down and have powwow about this\nWell I think after they get ten thousand phone calls and that their\nPhone all they're doing of answering the phone for the next week that that somebody's going to say hey wait a minute the American people are not fulfilled and are you know this is you know it's something reminiscent of a you know the ... behind the iron curtain before for the Berlin Wall fell\nIt is a little bit of that criticism or\nYou know I'm overstating it slightly here but the point is that here you had a major news event that took place for prestigious financial newsletter held a conference\nA pre eminent expert they used more examples in exemplars from the government did they demonstrated how the government did not handle it properly\nThey demonstrated why it was a forgery over ten separate different point um and yet and yet and yet it was not on the top of the news not on the top of the newspapers H. P. granted it two or three paragraphs at the end of story um\nI Want to ask you a question Chris I Am not a fan of Bill Clinton's particularly as administration I I don't like the way he operates but I'm also not one of his dire enemies I'm not a Rush Limbaugh and I I really really do want the audience to understand\nThat I'm not just out to get a president but my God the truce ought to be\nI'm not just out to get a president but my God the truce ought to be out on this if this is a ... a big obstruction of justice whether or not it goes to do that level I just don't see how they can ignore this I'm let's\nGet something straight truth is not Republican or Democrat one of the reasons why I think we're not having um progress as much progress as we shouldn't getting to the bottom of the foster cage wife said this well is that the corruption goes to both parties here yes that's number one I don't disagree number\nTo this ... this um one of the main supporters of my work is James Dale Davidson had a strategic investment chairman of the national taxpayer June and he is a former friend Bill Clinton gave the maximum amount allowable campaign contribution to Ninety two\nWent to renaissance weekends with the Clintons to Arkansas balls when he was a inaugurated governor um\nAnd he thinks that the evidence here it's just shocking and overwhelming I didn't come into this saying\nI Want to get Bill Clinton I'm looking at the evidence where does the evidence take me it doesn't say Bill Clinton murder in the last for Hillary fun you know it says that some things smells here that Vince Foster if he's a friend or the club presidents or if he's just a local um\nWorker at the local deli he deserves to have the same police investigation\nYou know you've got to wonder if you had this report in the news conference had already occurred uh when sixty minutes game do you whether they would have even included this in the report\nThey probably wouldn't of [laughter] and you know the ... the\nFunny thing is a number of people said well Mrs foster has identified that do well as the experts pointed out or the English expert with telling a number of funny stories where people believed the family members believe\nThey had actual documents when they really had forgery sure of loved ones and things like this uh the family doesn't have a particularly trained died for foreigners are good for sure they can for any one well\nI accept I guess uh the full blown experts I mean there have been people in museums fooled\nBy um forged art work uh\nBut then there are levels of experts they can bring in that absolutely determined this is either the real McCoy or a fake\nRight\nAnd so you live and in fact done exactly the same thing you brought it in the really big guns\nAnd their report was conclusive Chris\nUh absolutely they concluded forgery they didn't say well it could have been it might have been uh they said it was actually a pretty crude portrayed I'm Mr all in the English expert is quoted as saying um something to the fact that uh\nUh that the the foreign journalists are fairly good for German but a could could forge a check but he wasn't a real pro how he described them\nWell whoever would be involved presumably would not have a lot of time\n[noise] yeah they apparently there were several days of course as you know it took about a week\nThere was several days apparently to put this together the experts believe that they use known handwriting the Vince Foster ... copied them and of course you know this machine that the White House and the government has simulated handwriting [noise]\nNo I did not well yes\nThey have high high high powered scanners and also pen machines that can mimic\nUm the president's signature ah more than that\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Bullhead City", "day": "28"}
