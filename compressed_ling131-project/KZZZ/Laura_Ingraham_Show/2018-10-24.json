sometimes you\nJust want to see the best way you know usually when it comes to the national title game we like Cinderella is early and then you want to see the two best teams in the country\nUm you know it comes to Super Bowl you want to see the two best teams played for the title baseball you're going to have the two best teams at least it looks like that but the Dodgers and the red Sox um\nSeem president stand casting joke that it was unfair that Los Angeles had to face a higher payrolls team like Boston now the socks do have the highest payroll the Dodgers had the third highest payroll\nMaybe that's not ideal from being competitive standpoint for major league baseball that's why you like those stories like the Milwaukee Brewers of the Oakland A's\nYou know that they're doing it with a you know payroll that not two hundred million dollars big stars got MBP types here a sigh young winner's iconic ballparks she got great fan bases so west coast east coast you have everything you want in this World Series baseball's had a lot more parity over the last decade\nOr you know we've seen the royals an Astros win titles even the cubs finally winning but now the stages said\nFor the rosters loaded with big ticket items in recognizable names so time to bring it on and this was something that uh you know it's great for baseball hopefully it's a great world series and he liked to have some more key names\nAnd you do have that and plus you know Fenway in October is awesome and now you have Dodger Stadium\nOr would that crowd um but it but it helps when you have east coast west coast and you have these big names in there as well and you certainly have that I did a\nPoll question make love and what do we have so is it time for the ...\nSo out there yeah well\nThe new factor that in no I did all liberal [laughter] yeah but teams their locations didn't\nChange it's going to be difficult here and even last night you know LeBron didn't close out well you missed a couple of free throws a you know you have a six point lead the charge supposed to win those games and but this was a learning process here\nHere's Luke Walton he brought up something interesting about how the officials view the Lakers\nI I just can't anymore if suddenly selling points in the bank to fifty something again they shoot us in the free throw line thirty for both\nOf ... wants to play watch the play where I got a technical Salah was what happened to the brawn James is on it's the same thing\nThat James Harden and Chris ... shot thirty freak those on it the night before federal Broncos up on a screen somebody trying to fight over same same thing they shot for those on the same thing we are going Seventy points at night in the pain was tell jaws heart plays this game played forty minutes tonight all he does is attacked around zero freak those tonight\nZero I Know they're young\nI get that but if we're going to play a certain way let's not reward people for flopping thirty feet from the whole on play that have nothing to do with that possession they're just ... just to see if they get up alcohol\nAnd then not reward players that are physically go into the basket and getting hit it's not right [noise] well\nThe you know that's about as demonstrative as you will hear low balled and but he's right if that's the style you're going to have if you're not a great great three points shooting team and you don't have a size then you're going to be saying do you guys let's let's do something different let's go to\nLet's see if we can get fouls called we can shoot free throws and maybe that's the style the approach you have with LeBron Josh hard ah\nYou know you've got ... ... you got guys who can get the room into the room and I think that's important if you're if you're going to have that approach their share of temple but taking it to the group and not relying on the three then you would hope that you get those calls there are certain player and I never understood this why the best players get the most calls\nEven when there's not a foul cold like there was a play during the NBA Finals years ago back in the you know in the nineties with Michael Jordan and uh I'm I'm watching the game and I'm watching with a former NBA player and Jordan drives the lane and then they whistle\nAnd uh he jokes to me he said what happens is the official sort of looks like a thousand you like ... there's not somebody to Colin Powell and it's a fan some foul but Hugo egos watch he's got to pick out so called the foul on poor guys going I didn't touch it\nBut it didn't matter it and and I always when I was like why don't you give the guys who weren't very good\nThose calls it's like Hey Mike we've got to get Michael Jordan a little help you know he's got to get a break somewhere in life what's a call ... ...\nDo you think ... call morphology outside the three point on line because they're easier to view and it got to harden that's what their purpose is out there with those pumps fakes and jumping into people\nWell I also think that hardens got down to a science that hard and has the ability he uses his body better than any other player and that is should get separation to get by you to step back\nTo drop out that he'll use that right arm in almost capture your arm and pin it down to his side so looks like you're following him you're holding him are reaching it um he's he's created to science out of this not everybody has you know he says fortunate but nobody gets a lot of calls\nIt's the other players Josh are it's not going to get those calls and that's what's new qualities Satan why not and he's right\n[noise] I few phone calls here yeah Reggie will join is coming up a little bit ah let me see Jeff in Milwaukee Hi Jeff what do you have for me today\nFor them to pay a quick quick cowboys\nQuestion for you what was it a bigger waste the last fifty seconds of the game on Sunday or a first round pick on\nThe receiver you might be able to get what maybe eight to ten other was better than a nice [laughter] um [noise]\nThey last fifty seconds actually the worst and I'm not a cow by saying I don't care but Rogers when [noise] sixty or Ninety hours in sixty seven seconds\nYeah but you can't you can't you can't compare that to you can't compare that to me is that good I Know\nYes you can't look and thanks for the phone call to avenge pour clock management or with Jason Garrett I ain't got squeezed out a couple more play at least one more play I got it you know I got to get five yards like ten yards seven yards I got to make it a little bit easier on my kicker there\nAnd I just didn't they caught management was ah was going to [noise] and she met North Carolina ... what do you have for me to come on and then to thirty [noise]\nOr how I got him on the school board to get started today\nAction against Saudi Arabia I recently far off Fox News the wife and I think it's revoking these is against Saudi nationals tied to the killing of journalists\nTaking action against Saudi Arabia I'm Lisa like Sarah Fox news the U.S announcing its revoking visas against Saudi nationals tied to the killing of journalist your mouth to show game are making\nVery clear that the United states does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence ... a journalist or violence we continue to maintain a strong partnership with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia neither the president nor I Am happy with this situation\nSecretary say my palm pale today President Trump said he is meeting with top officials tomorrow to discuss the findings of their investigation into his show is that the Saudi king has denied any involvement in the death\nDespite warnings from the Trump Administration that the military will be sent to the border caravan of thousands of migrants mostly from central and South America continues to make its way to the southern border\nGenerally these the composition the demographics of reading is no different than anything you see in any detention facility again from a gallon to San Diego basically people looking for a better life and see the women and children the same with all the guys hoping\nTo get in and get a job or whatever remarkable is out of the cells in women I talked to today is how few are on our informed\nAbout where they're going for scientists are going to say when they get their\nNow unlike the Tijuana camp people knew exactly what to say it was on a train if you will or the American lawyers these women\nAre nice um and yet somehow optimistic on\nHis late ...

panicking it feels like you know three lawsuits in a row for the Lakers to open up the season local reaction feels like a should we be in a panic mode what would you like to say to the lake or faithful\nAbsolutely not we're three four games into a very long marathon season\nAnd this is kind of what we expected and even to the point where Rob ... Magic Johnson went to ... and said hey you guys go out to a slow start\nIt's All right we are face in ... in this team um what it looks like to me is you've got\nThe generational type superstar player LeBron James and a lot of young guys that play hard but really don't know how to play\nAnd now you add to it to\nKey components being out you know three to four games in Rondo and anger from um I I kinda think this is what we expected this guy's not following the seasons not over you\nKnow we can have this same conversation um Christmas in into the new year if they continue to play like this the one thing one glimmering side of the hope that I Do see is\nThey do play much harder than they play the last couple of years\nThey do play much harder than they've played the last couple of years now the question is\nAnd I think this will be all on LeBron James figuring out how to win bought out a win ballgames close ballgames the bond with the big three they found a way to push that game to overtime but they couldn't find a way to win the ball game and that's always the mark of a young team\nAnd I think a lot of that will probably bear on the shoulders of the broad\nYeah you can't blow elite like that you know that that's where I mean good teams hold onto those lead but and I'm not I I'm just looking for sort of what is the momentum and growth that I see with the team and that's the way I think that most people\nShould and will approach this but you do have people thinking well LeBron there should be immediate results and even when he came to Miami and went back to Cleveland it just doesn't happen that quickly with him\nKnow and I and the two places you just mentioned had much more talent and more veteran\nI had a more veteran presents then there's this young team um again when you had a you know Iran do and you add the land Steven fan and these guys that have been around the block a few times people expect results quickly um that's just not the case because\n... is playing a lot of young guys I mean John Williams I mean I was calling his games in guns at last year and during the tournament and he's in the fourth quarter in overtime making big time plays\nSo this is what you've got ... is growing pains and you've got to understand that any kind of see the you know the expression on a liberal I mean the whole trust the process that sounds a lot like Philadelphia right and we see how that's working out right\nUm so trust the process understand as the young team there and take your lumps we can have this conversation there play like this January first\nThat's different but I wouldn't give them a long leash um just for the simple fact you know I see this team all the time they are playing much harder now than they did a couple of years ago and a lotta times that's a big step for young teams\nThe rockets Lakers fight and I missed it I I was surprised that a Ingram only got four games and that Rondo only got three because if you're spending or your you know ... room with a shot from behind a cheap shot there you know Chris Paul is going to get suspended because you throw a punch their\nUh what did you make of that in the entire situation\nNumber one I wouldn't know I Will never ever advocate violence that's just never been my motto but I Will say this S. H. I. T. happens things happen\nAnd I think what's been missing in our game\nAs we have a collection of great stars individual but what's been missing has been team rivalries well we have a team rivalry there's been a long a decade long history between Rondo and Chris Paul and it's been simmering for awhile\nAnd with both of these teams being in the western conference both teams in my opinion should be in the playoffs\nWe have another great rivalry something that's been missing and ah yeah it was a cheap shot biting or I'm coming in behind but in times like this if you're the lake or fads\nAnd if you're the Lakers you find out who was in your foxhole and I don't want to I don't advocate ... I don't but look I've had my share I've been in a few of them more than a few um you find out\nWho's with you you want to know who is a little on the run I Want to know who is with me ... all of this do I can roll him is even three they have history history run into another\nRound O's fitness way\nThat it depends on what angle you look you know I wasn't even if you find one angle I don't lead and only ten if I find one\nNo ... do I think he's spit in his face you know do I think he was talking and spit came out and\nHit him in the face [laughter] yeah I don't think he was blatantly tried to ... you know put a little you\nKnow and love likely he looked like he was trying to do you think he I mean I I think there was intent there\nI Do\nFor how to react that way like what happened in that moment because Iran do doesn't say anything to you there has to be something manual that happened to Matt ... they work hard okay what do you think Rondo said we're all used a\nMagic um what was wrong but I'm saying or was Chris Paul saying what\nWas Rondo saying that may cruise politics is when\nThrough your violin lessons now that\nThat would be a little more fascinating and did she make love and
