P. show email address deep you damned Patrick dot com and\nMental health station pure F let's try that again the glove and what kind of pull question I put up the great bullpen a great starting pitchers sixty one percent would rather have a great bullpen in the playoffs and great starting pitchers\nYeah we also wondered who is the quarterback the active quarterback who could take a shot and Drew Brees as all time record and then and keep in mind I think breeze plays this next season and probably to more after that so you're looking at maybe eighty thousand yards when all said and done for Drew Brees\nThe only ... through and there was a breeze is\nDoes does his head coach Sean Payton stay with the sex that because it feels like there's been there's little friction their feels like with the coach in the front office and let's say Dallas opens up which is speculate would Sean Payton be on the shortlist there and would that be a job that he'd be interested in taking\nI wouldn't because I might have a little friction with the front office if I go to Dallas I Know I'm going to have a lot of friction with the front office there with Jerry Jones and second guess it\nStill feels like Sean Payton is able to do what he needs to do and have Drew Brees there and maybe you just attach yourself to Drew Brees and vice versa and uh you know run this played out because you have a good team\nYou know in England back with Kamara\nOr they got some young wide receivers here\nAnd there they they the question is if the defense plays like it did last year and that's why I had them going to the Superbowl and you know what ... is looking at this I thought San Francisco in Seattle would be better and therefore put up more of a challenge for the rams\nBut the rams could end up fourteen and two Thirteen and three and then that could be the difference maker where you have home field advantage throughout yes we'd love\nOh by the way we got a couple of tweets saying we're forgetting about Tom Brady who has about sixty seven thousand five hundred if he can extend his career the way he's saying he could potentially break breach he's five thousand behind them that sound possible the\nI don't know how long he plays I Know he says forty five\nYeah if you believe that and he's in play yeah\nBut I it feels like breeze would be more apt to play so he's forty five and Tom Brady\n'cause I I it feels like Tom's wife it feels like she was ill has a little bit more of a say in this\nBut maybe a Brady gets the Superbowl and it's a walk off for him but you know maybe the shame for Drew Brees but bringing said to us you know he and his wife talked about it and she said play as long as you want plus he has his kids now at the age where they're able to watch that and the same with Brady\nThis is really big you know ... it's rare when a quarterback having kids were able to see dad play and play at a high level playing these big moments there and I think that that's something that is probably not factored in that often but these guys are playing longer\nAnd your kids have an opportunity to see you play I'm sure it's important with Brady with his oldest son\nDon't you be able to see dad play yeah I'm a club\nThat way you said in the first hour about the new rules you know letting these guys that to everything to maybe Brady can extend it too because you can't hit the quarterback\nIs the only way she Brady doesn't get along with his coach where's breeze and Sean Sean Payton have a great relationship and I think that that breeding might not continue to love football because of bill Belcher\nI think he loves playing it I think he loves that you know he has a good team and he's of winter and he's the greatest quarterback of all time you playing big games are playing pre Super Bowl but it's that every day where you show up and we've all had that boss where you just show up and you go he's a buzz kill me not any fun\nAnd that might be the thing for bread yell me about it\nAnd I know I saw it and do you laugh a little longer look quite their job I had the same ... as a law that data that have gone in la [laughter]\nWhen I when kids more than ... ... when bill Hader did his cage Morris is such a very low [noise]\nEither way\nI'm watching the Astros game\nWell here we go [noise]\nDid you guys know the answers are on TV yesterday 'cause Todd was texting me throughout the game and he gave me a Astros up tend to true exclamation point exclamation point and I went he's\nDoing play by play down to one and all of a sudden like in a matter of minutes are up tend to two and a mad assuming everyone's definitely watching the ... Indians game on a weekday afternoon even though it's a playoff game yeah and I was joking around and I was having those being playful like putting those ... bell and Kevin Bass and\nYou don't follow the ... during the regular season at all there wasn't enough ...\nAnd and you have no business texting about that and you're this diehard Astros fan\n[laughter] I don't think I've ever used the\nPhrase die hard back in the eighties I was crazy ... rainbow strength ... you're not sure like everything you took three decades off\nThen you still have the gear but you're not an Astros fan so I ... I understand you're a Broncos fan I get it you are much more passionately or not an Astros Hammond asked no you're not no you're not\nThat whole process was not smart then I went to a zipper food it's technology find the right people\nOh did you find the right people I've ever seen like real hot so I get qualified candidates fast smart\nThe white different groups really never went by floors in the U.S try now for free at ... dot com slash free that zip recruiter dot com slash free paper [noise] smartest way to hire these are\nSome people say we have a weight with where it's like the number one news on radio network\nI Am and now I Want them to seven point five of them were going on\n[noise] good to be for fire the year is going is coming up in a couple of minutes [noise] obviously talk about his season tiger being back what happened is the Ryder Cup\nWill ah talked to Brooks kept coming up here in a moment eight seven Seventy ... show email address BP a damn Patrick dot com or go to Steve in Atlanta who joined us the good morning when you have for me to\nThe morning then how are you doing sir I have\nA well I wanted to comment on your either best starting at your ... and\n... and I think\nStarting out best pitcher would be the best thing to do considering what you saw in getting three what the doctors and what happened with the dealer there and I think that would be my that's my opinion that's my best bet that I Would go with it is it good starting pitcher\nAlright well thank you Steve it used to be that you tried to have those two great starting pitchers\nAnd if you have a seven game series and you're going to have those guys go four times of four times total you know then you have a great chance of at least getting three wins out of four\nAnd Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling we've seen you know history is littered with pitching stance that had to really good starters but if you have a middle relief gone and then you have a great closure that used to be that's all you needed then it became John wetland and Mariano Rivera with Mariano Rivera\nHe was the ... you know like the eighth inning guy\nThe lead into John ... but when you have that great bullpen backend bullpen I think it's just so valuable now and uh you're seeing that with some of these ... I don't think it's a coincidence that you have these teams who admitted this bar\nAt a you don't have a very good bullpen you know the Dodgers were still not quite sure about that bullpen but their pitching staff or their starters pretty impressive and shows Houston's I'd eight seven seven three D. P. show will bring back some of what Drew Brees had to say to the program in the first hour\nAnd we'll do that coming up he's Brooks kept good the freshly minted PGA Tour player of the year who joins us now\nCongratulations Brooks how are you today\n[noise] fish than appreciate it haven't been doing\nYeah what do you get for PGA Tour player of the year\n[noise] I mean incredible trophy hunter Jack

you met Jack Nicklaus\nWhat did you say [noise] ah\nI think I was in shock I was like Mr necklace uh\nOf in just nothing came out [laughter] I think that was pretty uh you know I grew up to an hour West Palm so we'd see I'm I'm a little bit there was a couple of junior golf tournaments so were they were named after him and and then he would come out to in kind of hand the trophies out and they all want\nOne twice or one of those golf tournaments so he's got to see 'em a little bit I mean obviously just grown up here you might run into them every once in a while but um he's a class act I'm Mr necklaces basically I'm somebody you want to uh me late news is an incredible guy and he's always fun to be around\nWould you voted for you for PGA Tour player of the year\n[laughter] I didn't I actually I was too lazy I didn't vote but\nUm yeah uh I don't know I Would never vote for myself I I just I just couldn't do it or would you vote for our number ...\nAh [noise] I Would have a maybe the way Bryson came on I was overweight um if not maybe Dusten I'm One of those guys who I Would have voted for but uh\nYeah then next next year I get next year I'm gonna vote [laughter]\nDoesn't the sport feel different when tiger back or does it feel different\nOh it's way different it's way different it's it's so good to have him back um anytime\nYou you can see it when you go to an event you can feel the energy uh there's\nDouble the amount of people that are they're double the amount of people that I'm sure that are watching at home um you can feel the atmosphere you know where he's out at all times I don't care if you're on the driving range and he's on the six whole you know I'm even on his practice rounds people are screaming and boring if he hits close um\n[noise] it it's fun to be playing golf with Tiger Woods there really is it it's good for this\nIt it's fun to be playing golf with Tiger Woods it really is it it's good for the sport it's good for us it's good to have him back and um you know it makes us next year or even that march that much more exciting\nIf I said one shot that you would want us to show the video of it I Would sum up your season you're year\nWhat would it be\nThe most memorable one for me it was a sixteen a bell or if the power of three or four and a narrative about six feet um and being\nI think gave me a two shot lead a going in the last two which is which is always a little bit nicer than one um but it was it was an incredible golf shots slighted beautifully hit my number I'm and under that much pressure on when you've got to tire\n'em on your tail says is never is never easy\nI wanted to see you to play together because you know we always talk about these guys to go toe to toe with tiger and then they melt down your like personality disposition it you don't get to higher too low so I don't know tiger would have had more any impact on you if you played together that day\n[noise] what do you say it doesn't matter to me it doesn't matter who you play with 'em you know I'm there I kind of actually funny story I learned my lesson the first time I've ever played\nWith him was that the PGA Championship in two thousand I think\nThirteen and I must have shot forty two on the front side wow what I'd done what I've done my entire life I spent the first nine was watching him\nAnd you get caught up just watching him like he was a kid so I did I watch them on TV if I went to a golf tournament and watch them when I was there and then now all of a sudden you find yourself playing with them and you're watching them again and I'm like well I'm here I gotta I actually have to play golf [laughter]\nSo back now I'm just going to try to do what I'm supposed to do and it was a good learning lesson for me and it's you know you see it with a bunch of the young kids that come out they don't they don't exactly play well with 'em 'cause they're just done that\nUm but I've learned I've grown a little bit since then and I mean I enjoy playing with him he's fun to play with and obviously you can the rulers and the people that are there um\nIt's it's definitely an exciting time when you're playing with them\nYour goal for your days off no not really [laughter] I'd much rather be either in the gym or on the boat or doing going fishing and if I can um [noise] I mean yeah I tried to practice a little bit before I head out to an event but uh you know stays off you gotta find what works for you\nBut you got buddies and I'm sure they want to play golf or all your buddies guys who play on tour\nOh no ah all my buddies really they play a little bit of golf um you know it was funny I took my best friend I'm Out first bachelor party in\nVegas and they all could not wait to play golf and all I was thinking was man I just really want some time off [laughter]\n\nI mean I went and played with them but I I think I only play like nine holes and just watch them the rest of the time but you know they they love the off um my best friends could care less um but they tried to play as much golf as they can and they know if I'm Around I'll come out and just watching and let them play\nHe's Brooks kept the PGA Tour player of the year joining us Dan Patrick show do you watch Florida State football\n[laughter] I Wish I could say I uh I'm not watching it but yes I Do watch it\nSo you water that that melt down against Miami\nYeah it was funny we've we've got a buddy of mine a it was a big Miami fan and he was there um and we were we have this big group chat with you know ten good buddies of mine and\nWe were lighting him up early and then he wasn't to [laughter] 'cause we're overseas hum and\nBy the time I woke up I'm looking at the score the game and I'm going to which has happened and yeah I just missed the last quarter and also what you gotta be kidding me um but yeah he definitely ah it it's not good right now it's not good to say that your four states a fan right now\nYou've had a few days to kind of a digest the Ryder Cup if I gave the team a Mulligan what would the team of done differently than the Ryder Cup\nYou know I don't know um [noise] maybe just an extra day\nI'm there I mean obviously it's hard coming off the torch championship a little bit of jet lag that's not an excuse but uh maybe it just another day to figure out the greens are a little bit um it took me a while to figure it out on them but the rest of the guys but just you know keep it up to speed on the greens we didn't make any pots there's there's no excuse for it um\n[noise] at the end of day it seems you know when and teams you know loose and the team that plays better\nIs gonna win or we just didn't do that and you know you gotta make parts if you want to win and I've never seen anybody now make parts and and when a golf tournament so are we just didn't do a we didn't take care of business and in ...\nAnd fairly Jesus Tommy Fleetwood had a hell of a time he was he was he couldn't stop celebrate man\nAnd he you know I'd be like check ball and I said I broke he goes what should check all real because I'm not your borough I said you know\nOr not you're broke I said I Am I ... no no no I'm not your borough I said hey I just said check ball road here\nAnd then after that oh boy anytime I had the ball went to the hoop Danny ended up on the floor [laughter]\nSo high I realized that we we finished the game and then all of a sudden it felt like there were more people coming over to the court and then I said to the guy that I was with former Arizona basketball player Craig McMillan Cher I said Craig\nI think we should get out and he goes I think it's a good idea [laughter] so I started to walk out and they started they started saying some things are here now\nAnd then I go and then I like I turn around ... you know like you're right no but then you know I had to go hey yeah Mr TV star like yelling stop and I was like man yeah\nI never admitted this before but I once I got my you know what kicked in a flag football game in college where playing like inter Merrill flag football with your fraternity there was a little flag it's supposed to be non contact right and it was just so sad I think we were like the beach team 'cause I wasn't even that could have an athlete to make the play\nSo flag football this guy knocks me over supposed to be kind of light\nAnd that's I'm he's running past me I kind of give them that leg whip moved to the leg\nI kick 'em in the ... and I thought I got him I stood up he did one of those around houses from behind the back\nAnd dotted my eyes for me I just drop like a noodle but it's really embarrassing to get beat up in a flight for me but was it a cheap shot yeah I Try to him probably fair art he just was better than me you know start\nMy own language has been getting punched in the face to me that that's that's that's not equivalent at all we can just kick your leg back or something like that I\n...

David Price can under him in ... while you have to leave him at home and even if you're leaving him home you got you got wrapped up there in a you know the other night\nYeah yeah I mean you know the this say anything is possible you could see him in a relief rolls still although it's they don't have many lefty hitter sees not really a specialist and\nAnd he's been so bad in in the stadium here I just I but I Do think if Boston advances he's in the rotation for the next round he may get moved to the fore guy or something like that but he will be one of their starters that they play Houston\nDo still feel like there's this like is there still tension between the red Sox Yankees you know the and it's been a long time that they got together in the play offs but do you do you still feel like it's there\nIt's nothing like it was of course and there's much more professional respect and they're all play association and all that stuff it's just the millennial cyst on and why are the way most
