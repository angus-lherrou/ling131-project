P. thanks for taking my call by ten o'clock Ninety five [noise]\nI think that you brought up the resigned thing at the beginning of the segment and that's where my head that is I think this is a case where resigning for DJ dirt game is not only best for the school and for Jordan McNair as parents but it's also the best thing for Americans career yeah\nBecause he can he can go to the parents and say I'm so sorry this happened on my watch they'll settle with some financial settlement outside of core and then he walks away and maybe he looks good in the public eye and maybe he can kinda reevaluate and say you know what\nI Can't have this ... anything like this ever happen again he can start off or you know maybe at a a smaller school and now he's toast he's going to get lucky to get a I D three job at this point he may never recover from that\nWell he might hit somebody that he knows who will bring him in as an assistant coach no thank you Josh that happens a lot when there's a scandal and the coach gets fired then sometimes you bring them in as an assistant coach you can sort of hide him a little bit and let him kind of build his way back up but um\nAnd you're just looking and and it's not a great program to begin with and he didn't have a great record each ten and Fifteen and then you're gonna bring you back could you've kept him suspended\nYou know to bring him back and you're just you're revisiting these headlines again and if I if I keep him suspended\nAnd I said to him look it's best for all of us that you're not coming back here will keep you a suspended will pay you but I I don't see the positive of this\nAnd so by bringing him back then you were saying hey he's not responsible for any of this well he is whether it's hands on her by proxy this is your strength and conditioning coach who ran your\n... your your workouts you hired him is your guy you can separate the two trust me the second most important person in a college program is the coach and strengthen conditioning coach and interviewed the head coach\nYour DJ drinking the reason why you get paid when you get paid as you assume own responsibilities that that goes with your title now you get paid for this you'll get paid when you when you get blamed when you lose there's violence there's bonuses there's all of this\nSo you can all of a sudden pick and choose and say well you know you're not involved in this\nAnd I don't like pointing fingers\nAnd certainly Maryland football but I I just can't imagine what this must be like for the family of that boy who died you're going to go yeah he's hey not bad coach alright anybody else lose their jobs you can admit\nThat there's culpability because you're worried about a lawsuit hey we've got budgetary concerns here so you're the University of losing money\nYou know people could use a scenario where the disgruntled players on team and tell them already ... joined Twitter and are said stuff on Twitter do some type of protests or some type of a walk out out of the game this weekend Michigan State at home or their biggest game of the year ...\nYou know what this has become must see TV just for the start of the game in my opinion\nThat normally you wouldn't watch Maryland play anybody and the fact that Maryland's playing Michigan State at home after this and I'm Wondering what these kids and and I was asked you know if I was in college and I was Nineteen or twenty I don't know if I'd have the backbone to do it\nMulti dimensional ammonia free salon quality color for under twenty five dollars and joined the hundreds

emails here are some great email and I always appreciate the input that though the audience provides this is from Clint I'm an attorney in Pennsylvania\nThe retaining of the head coach at Marilyn can't be a decision because of fear a possible lawsuit there was a rule of evidence that says a correcting major can't be used in court to imply guilt so when he lawsuit wouldn't even be able to mention that he was fired\n[noise] this is from a Isaac Barkley who says I Do not disagree at all but I think you've got to follow the paper trail Maryland is still paying Randy essentials currently the second highest paid state employee\nBoosters are contributing to salaries so adding DJ Dirk in to that list isn't necessarily a good look they're hoping he takes another job or leaves on his own at the end of the season\nSo that money doesn't have to be paid horrible movie because it tells the players and families\nThat are Maryland only cares about money which is something we already know about college sports my kids wouldn't play there and I love the school thank you ...\nAs soon as a from Monte a D. P. new angle possible or possibly the reinstatement of DJ Dirk and would provide him the opportunity to retire which would save on a payout if he's fired possibly\nThe university ah said you retire and save face wearable fire you would cause invite you in court if needed\nIt's um I guess not a simple solution here I'm just curious ah what the legal ramifications are because that's what this is\nIf there was no lawsuit there was not money big money attached to this would Marilyn had kept DJ Dirk and then the answer is no in my opinion so if you're doing it to protect yourself\nOr with lawsuits shame on you\nBut I think that that's probably what's happening we'll talk to a Christian and she'll join his are coming up get his thoughts on this as well uh eight seven seven three D.

I don't totally understand all the spin erasures has rewritten the record book in this system at when did that system to combat a new system resuscitated Brett Farr career like it had to work for Joe Montana why is it had west coast became so all that\nDo you think he has the pieces around the globe working receivers Green Bay has done a disservice Aaron Rodgers\nI Believe\nPersonnel why our scheme was\nFirst don't end up perhaps ... but I Would I Would defer to those who played the sport to tell me differently on that uh but I think they've done a disservice to him I think we'll look back on the Rogers era like if you gave him Ben Roethlisberger ...\nDon't you think Rogers is doing more with that he's\nGoing to have one Super Bowl to show for his career perhaps and people still make the argument he's the greatest quarterback of all time now he's the most talented quarterback you can make that argument can I say the greatest quarterback Baltimore\nI don't think you can yeah I'm a club\nBut to me he's put up better numbers at any quarter back in history argued way so it's not that often says oriented defenses never stepped up to match you know I mean he's got the those guys make the weapons they don't they Brady never has anybody I mean Brady receivers had been kind of a mishmash\nYeah and I think that's that's a credit to getting the right people putting him in the right places they took chances they took chances on Gronkowski is bad back that's why you didn't go first round Aaron Hernandez we know the baggage jihad that's why he didn't go first round there first round challenge um but some of the other wide receivers like\nKevin folk became irreplaceable until James White came on board here but they take Dionne Lewis should make him a star a Hogan they take him off the scrap heap a ...\nYou know nobody heard of Edelman before so I I I have to give credit to the the the entire system they're drafting those players to understand what the rules are
