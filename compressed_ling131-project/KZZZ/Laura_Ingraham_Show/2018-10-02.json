beyond bell can give you off speed pitchers you know he can he can give you a full throttle and then he can you know take a lot off of it\nYou can catch the ball is a lot that he can do and that's why probably the best running back all around running back and football but at the Steelers have moved on from him now you got to regroup and say All right this is who we are now what do we want to be and last night\nAll the more which the better team and the Steelers now one two and one who did the Steelers have up next McClellan do check the effort ... already\nA college football Notre Dame handled

Brady tying Vinnie ... for most of all time best diverting played for seven different teams Brady of course only one Seventy different receivers\n[noise]\n\nIsn't that amazing\nI I wouldn't have thought that Vinnie Chester Verde would be the answer there but if any plane which seven different franchises makes a lot of sense and many played a long time but here's Brady\nDoes that speak to the even more greatness with Tom Brady Seventy different receivers on one team\nThe turn over there and they're you know trying to make Cornell Patterson a wide receiver they're basically a kick returning guided Seventy different players have caught a touchdown pass from Tom Brady\nVinnie tends to Verde also which Seventy different players pretty basic here's a Josh Gordon made his debut for the patriots\nAnd solve them just said can ... you know I didn't find how\nHe's been room for me and [noise] and so it's been awesome support as ... as well as the rest of the team made from staff here and we'll probably pass in God and my love than my love the game football\nRight I don't see how he does but a obviously a great talent that's never been in dispute never an argument there it's everything else that goes along with a with a Josh Gordon John ... got his first winning a decade and a had to go to overtime to beat the pesky Cleveland Browns here is John ...\nMy first went on a

been so nervous on twenty nine are filled all my life\n[noise] there was also play in here I thought it was\n... the spot for the Cleveland Browns was I thought a little suspicious I thought they got the first down and then I realized that when I watch the replay I didn't know if it was enough evidence to overturn the call\nAnd you know if you're looking at where an elbow or a risk went down and then they decided to overturn it I don't know if it was a good spot to begin with but I didn't think there was enough evidence to overturn\nAnd a Cleveland Browns ended up losing also thought that there was a fumble on their car they didn't call that now they ... scored with Nick Chubb you know when they got the ball back by the way I didn't notice with a Nick Chubb a there have been over twelve hundred instances where players had a hundred yards rushing\nAnd it leads to touch down to the game and NFL history Nick Chubb is the first to have at least a hundred yards and two touchdowns in a game with three carries or less [noise]\nOut of your day to day that it was a sad day [noise]\nIs that what data\nNot a bad day for a Georgia running backs their job and Sony Michel that's why

trash I'm ready to come on let's go let's go watch hockey in Denver [laughter]\nI wanted to tell you about Thursday um I watch the hearing with very closely because something similar to what happened to that before it happens to me like almost Thirty years ago well sure\nI think it but I mean that's fine um so I listen\nTo both story and they were both very sincere and they both seem very believable that there was one sentence that doctor for it so that just rang a bell in my head\nAnd told me he really wasn't telling the truth and I had to play it over time is to make sure I actually heard what I thought I heard\nBut he had something like I Know he went down to rape me and I thought he might accidentally kill me\nWhile I don't know that you said I knew it does you knew he was going to rape me or what you said was I thought he was going to rape me or he was attempting to rape me by taking off my ... my clothes and I was afraid he would accidentally kill me when he put his hand over my face my mouth\nSo that was the word that yet grabbed me because when that happens all signs in from my own experience I never why not somebody went down to I don't care ever going to accidentally or on purpose tell me I mean if somebody in\nYour perpetrator they have and can't nobody no wonder\nWell isn't that terrible person that accidentally do something\nYou have to find her and I think that\nMan and understand I Roberta don't get me wrong I totally respect you sharing what ... what happened to you like I have to believe every experience is different and I don't know there were moments there were there were believable moments for from both of them and there were some awkward moments\nComing from both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh he apologized for going after ... uh and same\n... when he when he turned it around on her and said if you ever had moments of blackout do you like beer\nAnd of course she had explained to her father had been an alcoholic and she became then a very sympathetic figure it was a bad moments why he apologized to her because he realized I went too far now he's angry he's upset he's emotional he's crying he's raging he's furious that his good name has been destroyed in the blink of an eye\nSo there were there were moments that both of them have you could pick that apart it ain't going to do any good it doesn't really matter what's done is done the senators heard from both of them the FBI\nHas until friday and then we're going to see what they do\n[noise] um I I can guarantee you there will be a lot of objections to the FBI investigation I can promise you they will move the goalposts some more I can I can say with great certainty great certainty\nThat this is not going to be fulfilling their satisfying for anybody for
