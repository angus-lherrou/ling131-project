Dodgers feeding the brewers five to behind Clayton her show up three to what the series Red Sox beat the Astros with a little bit of drama there\nThey lead three games to one in that series tonight it'll be the red Sox and Astros game five Broncos and the cardinals and the brawn James\nMakes shoes Laker debut it's funny to think that LeBron has only been a Lakers since early July it feels like we've been adjusting to him and the purple and gold for some time now and probably because every move he made this off season is scrutinized or over scrutinized and in many ways he used the sport\nThe words of the best team you got some nice rookies coming in and the Lakers might not even be close to playing for a championship but they are the team with the most interest the season and probably the closest thing to LeBron right now is maybe Michael Jordan the last few years with the bulls because every game that he played\nThe media was covering it became a circus in the Bronx it's similar when you throw in the lake or factor the NBA age most glamorous franchise LeBron following in the footsteps of Kobe and magic and cream and Jerry West in Shaq and many more and the funny thing is\nWe have no idea how any of this was going to play out on the court because it's a new team it's an unconventional\nRoster but if LeBron is playing\nPeople are going to tune in I mentioned about Fifteen minutes ago what I think his strategy should be for the first month of the season that shit I'm that's right I'm traveling abroad how he should approach to the first month of the season everybody else is going to be telling him probably after game one but I Would be cautious\nIn my willingness or my ability to dominate\nBecause I Want these other players to grow incompetence in stature and let me see if they've added to their games every great player adds to his game\nThat's how you become a great player because the guys who don't they stay good players are average players or they're not in the league anymore I Want to know if Ingram has taken the next step or coups much taken the next step Josh heart is taking a next next up ... all the other guys who were on the team\nThe unconventional roster we know what we're getting out of them\nStevenson is not going to surprise me to bail McGee is not going to surprise me Michael Beasley and rush on Rondo won't surprise\nAnd they'd help because how many of those guys are going to be there next year that's why if you pay for itself\nAnd then all of a sudden by December January you may get a better sense here I Would be really really cautious about trading any of the younger players because you might start to play well go we have a chance here to be the number four seat or three feet\nAnd you're going to fight that urge in my opinion\nI'd uh eight seven seven three ... show your email address BP a damn Patrick dot com we'll get your phone calls a lot of people had some thoughts about the controversial call last night with the Astros and the red Sox once in a home run I think we'll keep beds would have made the catch I didn't think that it was fan interference\nEnough to overturn it I think ... was in the stands or at least a portion of his glove was and then all bets are off after that but I Do think that would have made that catch here's ... on that controversial play I was\nPretty positive going to be able to catch it I'm I'm a jump to win over a bridge by hand up I felt like somebody had to push my love of the way or something and I got to\nSee a little bit of the replay and they I guess they're going to catch the ball and put it away so um I didn't know was caught him out so far I've gotten through at home but [noise] I guess he got the call right\nUnless the um ... thought that they were going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was going to make the catch you know maybe I don't know what factors in there and if you throw in the added element of Joe ... Joe ... the umpire\nOr you know might be a little tougher for people to figure out here but I I don't think he was blatant I don't think it was you know I'm gonna put my hands over the wall um it was probably a perfect storm there but I Do think that would have made the catch but I didn't think it was fan interference here is Alex score a Red Sox manager on the interference call\nThey'll call it out right away so replays and I don't know I Know the founders all that and that was pretty sure that it was going to be called out you know even reach over the the fast he was actually ... when the weather also that's the role and we got the up\nAnd also that overshadows Andrew been attendees catch to end the game bases are loaded and he drives to make this catch for the final out and if he does it make the catch if it somehow gets behind him it goes to the wall and the red Sox lose\nBut my favorite part of this is the local broadcast W E R I joke is big Leone is the play by play man for the red Sox and listen to what happens on this game saving catch\nPenny\nSo I just want head over heels in my chair [laughter] oh wow what a cat's by angel Ben intending\nJoe is listed as probable for tonight's game [laughter] I Love that looks like Jill just fell out of his share at four hours in thirty three minutes last night's Red Sox Astros game the second longest nine inning postseason game of all time\nBehind game five last year in the U.S between the cubs and the nationals a strategy wise yesterday with the brewers and the Dodgers I'm right there with John ...\nI'm watching Miley all of a sudden you know walks Ballenger and then I go wait wait what's going on and all of a sudden take him out pitching changes in your\nGone whoa okay\nGot All right hander with a left handed pitcher to bring in a right hander and it was a game on strategy wise but no matter what kind of moves you're making you still couldn't counteract how great Clayton Herschel was yesterday I mean that is that's one of those money games that you need from him and it didn't have\nGreat fastball but that breaking ball it is heartbreaking as what it is how good she was breaking ball it's heartbreaking yes for\nGoing into a couple of reports that Craig council didn't even tell most of his players about the scheme until shortly before game time catcher aircraft was in on the plan of course\nMiley was in on it as well yeah so the the day before next game starting pitchers sit down with the media and they have a press conference so here's Miley knowing he's pitching the one guy so he said I I didn't live is just vague with my answers there\nBut the average that strategy that a council him by the way Jackie Bradley junior has nine or be eyes with two outs in this series\nThe records for most Darby eyes hitting with two ounce is Yogi Berra who had one more ten in the Nineteen fifty six World Series [noise]\nOut of the day of the day a bus to do that [noise]\nIs that what that would be\nAnd its new fulltime talent you want to add to your ...\nExpress pros dot COM Express pros dot com good luck\nThe damn Patrick ... powered by then we said they do at GMC and used car center on the\nCan we just enjoy the driver\nMarcia gay harden how did you get any or they're getting older not battle here brains changing\nMeans you can do you think as you age really\nLearn how to help reduce some risks to your brain brain health or\nEvidence mounting ...

eight you're you're standup act to my kids are the ones who told me about you and you go and you can take your family there and\nIt's not like it's watered down it just smarter humor where you just don't use curse words but are are you bothered by the label of hey Brian he doesn't use curse words\nIt it's a double edged sword you know sometimes I Wonder if it keeps more people away [laughter]\nSeriously then yeah I wondered that took a G. rating\nOn a movie sometimes the movie doesn't want a G. rating 'cause people I don't want to go see that yeah it's sort of like that with comedy I I think if people don't know anything about me and hear oh he's a clean comedian people my God I Want to go see that guy whereas if they went and saw me they\nHopefully would laugh and not even think one way or the other about whether it's clean you know\nAnd plus you know you're becoming a big star you're you are comedians in cars with the uh Seinfeld right right yeah so you not only

like that are certainly of this magnitude\nAnd it was incredible because Josh reading may to catch the say two or three runs in the top of the inning a very similar play\nIf he doesn't make that catch though Joe I get the feeling with two outs in ... which is often running the red Sox could have easily lost that game\nGave it yeah by him certainly yeah question about it uh but then he did say that uh he ... he got jammed a little bit and the ball hung up and are these outfielders if fearless or they have great speed they have great a reaction gay you got a very good job but wasn't all that high\nAnd it was hooking a little bit away from them\nAnd but he just laid out we've seen him do it time after time\nAnd are the biggest moment he made the play and that's the way these young guys have been\nUh what did you think of the fan interference call initially\n[noise] well I knew generally I thought that the U.S fair game when you go into the stance and uh it was very hard to tell the fan reached over the yellow line or there would have\nBeen one really good side shot except the security guy got in a way but it was a definitive called by Joe West and the more I see it the more I think Joe got to write\nA book he told us after the game on our close game show he definitely would have thought that he really felt that he had it all lined up and he would have made the play\n'em and you know Dan it it's amazing was Joe West because he has been involved in so many huge plays a Red Sox history two thousand four he was the empire at second base when they Roberts had the biggest steel in baseball history\nIn game six there was a line drive by bell horn with two men on the left field they left me alone pie ruled double the ball hit the fan in the chest sponsor on the field Joel westover rural and call that a home run and then there was a play at first base for a ride slapped ... hand roll down the line\nAnd Joe West was the one who overturned that call and rule they ride out greater ferrets and here he is in another huge Red Sox moment\nHe probably going to get a standing ovation next time he goes to Fenway\nOn a plane like Saudi Arabia and all the suspect in the case now being interrogated in Saudi Arabia and so to say that one was actually visiting New York to make it depends on the other claims he's the one of them died a couple of years ago so hold

Shaw on ah the question of is she going to opt out of his contract with the Dodgers\nHave you made a decision on what your future is going to be if not have any gigs do you have after the end of the causes and to come up with that decision decision and uh it's my understanding at ten days after the world series so should be busy tenders\n...\nI'm going to guess that he will ah often but\nI have no inside knowledge on this but it seems like that would be maybe the smart thing to do fun to watch that yesterday that was called pitching that's on throwing that's on I'm going to overpower you with a Ninety eight\nAt so I'm going to frustrate you when you could tell you know it's one of those sometimes you'll face somebody and you know affect you the next game because he screwed up your ... your batting swing like he just guys when he thinks the knuckleball or\nYou know they would always have to get back into the rhythm of being able to swing normally because with a knuckleball you're trying to kill it\nAnd would that twelve to six ... that the crucial had yesterday I mean\nThat was smart worked there there's a lot of fun and you know watching the brewers pitching strategy I I'm fine with what Craig council that\nI Am you did it all season long your way and if it's you know not with the Tony La Russa you know guidebook here of how to handle a team you know everybody seems to panic a little bit\nHe did what he thought he needed to do at that time had a strategy he just didn't know the ... show was going to be that great because it could have worked out the ...\nDo you think that will catch on start putting a starter into shake up another team left to go to a righty mess\nUp with their lineup [noise]\nUh I guess really depend on how good a team\n[noise] uh I guess it really depend on how good a team or how bad a team was if you flip 'em around or if I bring a right hander against a right handed heavy line up when you think you're going to face a left hander\nBut I think it really depends on what picture you're going to bring in after that and you know what kind of wind up you're facing um\nSo it you know with the wave starting pitchers are viewed now we want you to go five innings that's it so the value of the starting pitcher is going down\nBut I don't know if middle relievers are going to go up\nI got are we going to develop middle reliever is more than we are starters I think it's sort of it's\nA strange period for major league baseball\nAnd last night that might be as strange as any movie you've ever seen and postseason history where strategic in what you were trying to do we're going to have this guy go out and throw one batter to one batter and it was plant and an almost worked for them\nA Red Sox in the Astros that'll be coming up tonight oh that'll be eight or nine eastern\nGain for taking for hours and thirty three minutes\nFeels like we only focus on that in the playoffs you know during the regular season nobody seems to matter but everybody's up in arms wouldn't last long there's more pitching there's more ... more moves that are made I understand it um I Would love that we were limiting the number of moves you could make in a baseball game\nI'd love that you know we're we're limiting the number of a trip she can make to the mound how about we limit the number of movies that you could make when it comes to ... because it feels like it's going to throw one pitch I'm waiting for that one just throw one pitch and then you're waiting seven minutes to get somebody in there again um\nBrewers in the Dodgers of course a Dodgers lead a three games to one the brewers have the starters have only\nPitched fourteen inning show for that's the lowest total ever according to the allies were bureau that's through

to see the odds you would get me on life Pacers finishing second in the east I don't know this whole top Boston on but also admit that they've silently created probably the deepest team in the lead right now are adding Evan he's he's a foregone conclusion as a starter\nAnywhere else but he is leading our second unit that could probably be a group of five starters do you think they're deeper than the Celtics\n\nUh [noise] that's that's a tough one I I don't I don't know that we can match up their starting five I think our bench overall might be a little better than theirs\nUm but I don't know that are starting five said continuously out power there is that we had a ten games I think we might win four of them versus Celtics that is they're they're just the top unit\nOr a thank you for the phone call ... yesterday I don't I don't know if he wanted a shower shame bet there but I I wasn't going to do that on the Pacers finishing second hey Pacers are fun team\nThey are they're not as deep
