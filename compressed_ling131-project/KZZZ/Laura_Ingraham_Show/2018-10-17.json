imitation sound like passion for homes and Louis Armstrong kind of had a child sexual you know\nA couple of tweets here of ... give Andy Reid credit getting rid of Alex Smith after more homes only started and weak Seventeen last season absolutely\nThey changed the team it it changed the dynamic that their ability or you have to respect the past the deep passed a MK\nMac Elway might not have had a league wide receivers but he did have Terrell Davis it running back chin and sharp as tight in\nBoth and the whole thing you know you miss the point I said the three superbowls they lost and came back\nKnow who they had\nCovered the superbowls talking about the three superbowls they last check the pro ball players that he had the three of egos ever made the pro bowl Orson Mobley never made the pro bowl\nSteam Sewell never made the pro bowl Rob Lytle didn't so that's the point I Know shaman sharpen Troy Davis run the whole thing Gruber\nA mat Nelson last team to win a Super Bowl with an old pro wide receiver\nWho was the last team\nIt's not as critical of the positions we think it is the glove and you know the last Tuesday Super Bowl winning team what\nThey have an old pro not pro ball all pro\nYeah wow I have no idea why don't you get that some thought God ... they don't have a little research by the way do you realize how rarely the Packers saints and and patriots take first round wide receivers\nThe patriots have Terry Glenn in Nineteen Ninety six was the last one the Packers javahn Walker in two thousand seven to ... and the saints did take granted cooks but he didn't didn't did he he didn't stay there very long ago\nYeah but he was there long enough yeah he was damaged himself to guys for the good to be out or am I liked him a lot guys still very good yeah I thought the rams getting him I was surprised at New England gave up on it\nAnd this age gave up on them too and yeah ... ...\nA ... there's no give up in ... a senior so a Sports Illustrated senior\nUp in ... a senior so Sports Illustrated\nSenior writer at Fox in baseball analyst game for brewers Dodgers that will be tonight when Fox Sports one uh Joe Buck and Joan ... cutting Rosenthal and Tom reporting from the field will talk about both\nSeries coming up today and tonight but a Tom thanks for joining us how would you sum up last night what happened to be ... and the Dodgers\nAs a lot of fun I mean it's fun for me because I don't care who wins or loses that you're rooting for one team or another I think it's been a ton of tense than these games\nIt's kind of the series and I thought that it's been a manager serious I don't think there's a lot of separation between these two teams you say a million pitching changes that was expected\nI'm ... and last night I think you just saw the Dodgers gets shut down all sense of Lee and you know Craig counseled that it was five pitchers that's pretty much the fewest are going to say in a ... game and the series um so there's a lot of heat on the Dodgers going to the game for the night\nWell finish the sentence if the Dodgers lose tonight dun dun dun\nNot over I still think they'll find\nA way to get this series back in Milwaukee hard for me to believe that this team that you know hit more home runs in any team in the national league walk more than they see the national league is\nIs going to lose three straight at home um so I wouldn't say it's a must win but you know ... down three one it's it's pretty darn close to it um so yeah I think the Dodgers will find a way like I said it's been an even series so far and they did get the tying run to the plate and that crazy night\nThan the last night when we thought this was going to be the Dodgers starters in the Milwaukee bullpen and the bullpen hasn't been very good from Milwaukee starters maybe a little bit better than we thought certainly last night but as you handicap the business and moving forward what do you think is going to be the key for both one key for both teams\nTo me for the brewers is Josh hater he's the most important piece on the entire chess board of the post season because he's not just dominating hitters Dan he's embarrassing them and he's sitting out there in the bullpen and I'm sure David Roberts is magic game you know it's like when you play the Carolina Panthers you've got to account for ... you know where is the every play\nAnd you're always thinking about ... when he might get dropped in the game because everything is going to stop when he comes in he has been that good at this first days and um so for me Dodgers they need the score runs early as you mentioned\nThe brewer starters haven't allowed that at all in fact the postseason they've allowed one run the entire post season in six games at look at that rotation right you got shot scene is seven team you got to wait ... signed a minor league contracts\nAnd tonight you're gonna get geo ... four and a half a day with the with the Washington Nationals\nI mean think about it the the brewers are trying to get to the world series and then ... the first four games are going to start geo ...\n... Sandy called fat or John try to you know has somehow\nCouncil makes this thing work obviously he wants ... a day Robert C rugs and the you know keep it a left hander is on the bench when\nDoes it all starts the game and then when he flips to his right hand and platoon like a line change in hockey is going to switch you know to his other right had ever labors and flip them over and then you know they got set up later on so I think council is\nReally mad as these games are very well but the key to may is Dave Roberts the Dodgers can blow up this plant by actually scoring runs against the starting pitcher\nThese ... these words illustrated senior writer working for Fox and uh the game coming up tonight game for brewers Dodgers that'll be at nine eastern on Fox Sports one we had Kirk Gibson on yesterday uh the anniversary of him hitting that home run off Dennis Eckersley what do you remember about that night\n[noise] uh [laughter] that's a bad memory for me because I was at the game covering the game and it was obviously ninth ending and they started work on my way down to\nThe interview thing is that the press box for the interview or Dodger Stadium and it's like a taxi\nCab ride so I Am I better start getting down there so I actually got down there to the room before you hit the home run but I saw it on TV\n[laughter] and I didn't get delivered ...\nCall lives so that was cool but I was like you know I'm never leaving the press box early again even if it takes me an hour to get down to the interview room\nI miss bill buccaneers error in Nineteen eighty six game six I was underneath outside the red Sox locker room because I thought the red Sox are going to finally break the courage\nSo I'm In the runway leading off the field going up to the locker room and all I heard was a war that I've never heard and we'll probably never here again [laughter] and I and I'm there in a ... I was listening on his radio and I said what just happened and he said the ... one is good\nPride always want to do that [noise] um well I just wonder what you thought about maybe the Packers going after ... um I feel like the window on Rogers is closing their city or to the first round draft choices and a lot of money and I know it would be a one year rentals probably fall but I was getting a chance and keep that date them off the field\nYou know what John I thought they were going to use those picks for\nChance and keep that deep into the field so you know what John I thought they were going to use those picks for a little Mac that's what I was told the Green Bay thought that they could get ... and imagine ... defense because then he makes everybody better I think Green Bay has a couple of running backs\nAnd you know Montgomery is not your ... you know you sort of the de facto running back because of all the injuries there any performed admirably but you know I think I could to having them in a variety of positions there who's the other kid they got their make love and they got air and Jones and the ... I like Jones a lot\nYeah people are wondering why they don't just use him as a ... yeah cause Williams\nWho's the guy is going to be the battering rams but I like Jones is your every down back or at least you know the first two downs you want to put Montgomery in there so I I don't need lay beyond bill I mean is he is he a great running back in an improvement over these guys absolutely I don't want to give up those two first round picks because\nMaybe just maybe the Packers will use one of those first round picks on a wide receiver maybe there's somebody out there that they find that they would use the first round draft pick up or maybe they trade down and\nGet a couple of extra picks I don't know but um you know feels like the eagles are the ones that want levy on bill and also he hasn't shown up this is the by week he hasn't shown up this week not expected to show how is he going to be ready to play after the earthquake\nIs he planning on playing after the by week if I'm going

warriors are a number one advantage the Golden State warriors as well and second on that show twenty Thirteen fourteen\nUh sixteen Seventeen and then you have the warriors twenty fourteen twenty

bend the Chicago Bulls or or\nThe next on the list that uh they won a Seventy six percent of their games so you're seeing the Golden State warriors at a record setting pace but we've seen that a

disliked or they annoying\nI retired they're great and and so we've gotten bored by watching the Golden State warriors\nI think we're accustomed to it it's rare when I'm surprised I think the ...

know the cowboys ...\nWhen they were good you know it's easy to not like teams that win a lot\nThe only reason why I Would root against Golden State and maybe not root against but I Would root for somebody else is just so we have\nA little bit of drama during the regular season because I I just don't want it to be a foregone conclusion where you're watching and you're going okay golden state's

college football and the predictability and we've seen this before you know Clemson Notre Dame Ohio State and you've got Alabama there and the club\nNotre Dame come on [laughter]\nWell yeah people but you have to be at a certain level for somebody to just like you\nOh yeah we dislike them but they have not been in that traditional they're not climate Ohio State of Alabama\nNo usually well but they play for national title a couple of years ago I mean there are nine noticed that they were in the stadium and back to and they did play in the national title get\nThe dislike of Notre Dame for winning survived a couple of decades when they weren't winning and they're still disliked it's impressive\nBut if they if how social media back then when Notre Dame was great consistently great uh you know then ... social media would have had a field day piling on Lou hold soon them against a you know the Miami Hurricanes even the Dallas Cowboys people would have had a there say on social media\nAnd just with Golden State and then you throw in Kevin Iran's role on social media where he has burner accounts refers to himself and third person and that just plays into what social media loves you know\nIf you're twenty five and you don't even have a reason why you dislike the cowboys and Notre Dame yeah it was early nineties for the cowboys late eighties for Notre Dame where they were just like because of their swagger for winning sweat yeah\nThey were great and they let you know that they were great and who am\nI think teams like the patriots have bill ... being outright cruel to the media they had cheating allegations like the evil empire Yankees average evil I I don't know why the warriors of falling I ... I Believe I totally agree with seeing they totally fall in that group I think that there I don't get why people don't like them\nAs well they went from ... one of the great stories but when you added Duran then that's when you pile on and then they got bogey cousins and then they piled on now that's just that's just smart front office and the drastic I mean you've got to give them credit for who they drafted\nAnd courage wonderfully likeable yes current met her when her past dumped the nicks and Phil Jackson and we're like wait what are you doing\nAnd then you realize what he was doing he didn't like what that was\nI don't think he wanted filled to be as godfather there he didn't like the front office and he looked at Golden State and said wait I got you know one of the best to weigh players and clay Thompson I got to you know maybe emerging a star and dream on green and Steph Curry might be as good as shooters we've ever seen\nAnd you put all that together and it was a great story and then to rent came in and then it through Iran wasn't there\nI don't think people will have a problem with Golden State because I think that you can make a legitimate claim they did it the right way and they shouldn't be plotted I mean these aren't lottery picks are high lottery pick Steph Curry was a lottery pick but clay Thompson dream on green I mean they did a great job you know see\nBut with that comes all of these other things that are kind of irritating like dream on cats for some reason when he goes up the block a shot still can't control is putting kicks between the legs like that's annoying yes an annoying part of his game yeah\nA staff putting up shots from fifty feet away and turning before it even has the ram is an irritating thing on if it was that if if it was a set of anybody else did that'd be like I get this guy out of\nYeah but they wouldn't make it like he'll he'll turn away I loved when he would take a shot and then like Andrew bogus would automatically just start running down the court I thought that was great that's like when you play pick up all and you take a shot and Hugo net or in your face it's not going in yet but you know it is\nAnd that did
