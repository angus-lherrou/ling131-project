does she show up at four O. one east coast time tomorrow in Pittsburgh\nRight that would make sense\nYeah what'd you play him\nIf he shows up you've got to pay him right and if and if you if you're going to pay him then you want to use him as much as possible because you know he's not going to be on your team next year but then he knows he's not going to be on the team next year that's where I think it gets a little tricky here for like Tom on the ...\n... it's also a possibility that he's not the best running back there I Know living on bells great levy on bell had war yard that carry last year that's not good James Connors averaging four point seven and he's also catching a ball he's on pace change Connor for ah sixty five catch it\nWhen there's no drama with him and and that's something that if the Steelers can remove drama here by the way speaking of drama I mean it's not a stretch what I said before the season started after watching hard knocks the grounds that huge action and taught Haley dolphins who coordinator cannot coexist that eventually one will go when you lose\nAnd all of a sudden you point fingers of the officers who've coordinator than the off into coordinator may point fingers back at the head coach I Wonder if either one of these guys are there next year and this goes back to what I'm Talking talked about with the development of quarterbacks you need consistency as a head coach and often should coordinator\nAnd they usually go hand to hand hand in hand but that's what you need and you can see quarterbacks coach was fired another coach comes in a different off into different off into coordinator and this can set you\nBack and could set back you know what we have with Baker Mayfield in Cleveland but I'm not surprised that there is friction between those two\nAnd I still think Cleveland there was an up tick to them that there's at least the company says pointing north um you know not dead north you know but there is there's still a possibility and hope there with what the Cleveland Browns are doing but you know taught alien to Jackson I you know huge Jackson really shouldn't be calling on anybody\nI get the fact that he still has a job it's amazing\nLike there's nobody in the history of the sport that she'd been close to being this inept use for his record goes and kept their job\nBut you know taught Haley's a personality and you know huge actions the quarterback whisper he should be developing you know Baker Mayfield he's done that before and that's what he should be doing or is he trying to do it and taught Haley won't let him\nNo more phone calls are coming up a Patrick my homes was uh talking about his performance yesterday for more touchdowns forum in here is the second year pro\nI mean this is

one [laughter] I've been a lot of impressions that's certainly bought or something [laughter] I don't like to do it on air\nYeah but we did talk to him about it\nYeah no I just I don't really I'm not it's just really don't I don't necessarily\n[noise] maybe if I combine the two I think we'd have it last\nYear leaving on bell had one thousand nine hundred and forty six yards from scrimmage so ... average four point oh eight yards per touch this year James Caan or is on page for over two thousand yards from scrimmage\nAveraging five point eight yards per touch pretty impressive pretty

years with um [noise] they they don't know if there's a cloud or over Pittsburgh right now and they end up in the ... we just see all the time and and it's it's\nI just wish people knew out that it was you know and of course we don't get on TV but you see it at home and it's at home it's awful well\nWe we agree with you and we're ... and again we're we're just our hearts are our hearts ache with you Mike I\nTo ask you if somebody in the neighborhood and somebody who had a neighbor who was one of the victims I have to ask do you hear a lot of political talk right now in Pittsburgh are people talking about who's to blame for this\nRight now we're just kind of ether respect or ... as as burgers you know we're we're strong people and\nI'm nobody's talking about it it's just it's where do we we can't even comprehend what happened then into the city that you know is is on the spotlight as her this week [noise] I mean that yeah we had a football game yesterday and and it took our mind off of\nIt but the show I don't even we can't comprehend\n... you're just you're not going out on\nThis this evil this guy or anybody in Pittsburgh knows the neighbor came from here across bridges and river\nThat to the cost and play the evil yeah and to do to come from we live it it's a stretch I made it well I mean it but it it it's not like he lived in the neighborhood next door if he had he had to cut\nIt it's not like it up in the neighborhood next door he ... he had to cook for them to the light\nLike we we agree with you we're so sorry for your loss but I'm I thank you very much for for

getting through this what's what what takes place next I can guarantee you what's gonna happen to the tree of life synagogue all the rhetoric aside\nThey'll have an armed guard or more going forward\nInside that synagogue you can you can get all ... all do all the hyperventilating you want\nMore and more schools now than ever have armed guards in schools\nWhy in the world why how in the evil is real evil exists palpable\nEvil is if we see it we have seen it\nAnd we we see it every day and you want to sit around\nAnd say well let's try to figure out how vulnerable people in the house of worship\nWho could be subjected\nTo anti Semitic violence who doesn't want those people protected\nBecause this isn't even a debate I flipped on I made the mistake I think Saturday Night of watching she then for thirty seconds maybe Saturday afternoon I saw some CNN anchor say the president said something about armed guards now we know that's not possible to have an armed guard\nIn a synagogue it's not possible to have an armed guard in a synagogue ... what do you mean it's not possible to have an armed guard in the Senate in a synagogue\nAnd of course normal people know if you have an armed guard in a synagogue the people in the synagogue have a fighting chance against a madman who walks in with guns blazing\nThis isn't even an argument the president said it cut number eight he went to his rally\nIn ah\nOr was he he was in the Illinois campaign rally in Illinois and he talked about a very common sense response to this kind of evil cut number eight from a audio from NBC and gravy and\nAn armed guard inside\nThey might have been able to stop him immediately\nThis would be a case for if there was an armed guard\nIt may be that would have been nobody killed\nIt's a very very\nSituation then when you look at it we can look at it two ways\nI guess if they ask somebody\nShame that you even have to speak that way his shame\nTo think of that his side of a temple or inside of a church\nBut certainly the\nResponse that's all that was that's what that's what a normal American says and yet CNN thinks that's crazy [noise]\nCNN thinks that's that's that's the
